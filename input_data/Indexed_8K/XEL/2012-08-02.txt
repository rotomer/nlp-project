(b)           the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Revolving Loans during such Interest Period, then (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Revolving Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans.

(c)           All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
 
(d)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to such Revolving Loans, on demand, from the Borrower. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Borrower against such Lender.

If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.
 
(f)            If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 3.4 or 2.11(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

Requirements of Law
 
(i)            shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except, in each case, for Excluded Taxes, Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.13 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);
 
(ii)           shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or
 
(iii)          shall impose on such Lender any other condition;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall pay such Lender, reasonably promptly after its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amounts. For purposes of this clause (a) and clause (b) below, (A) the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives in connection therewith are deemed to have gone into effect and been adopted on the later of the actual effective date thereof and one (1) Business Day after the effectiveness of this Agreement and (B) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in any Requirement of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued; provided that, as to any Lender seeking reimbursement or compensation hereunder with respect to either of clause (A) or (B) immediately above, such Lender shall only be so reimbursed or compensated to the extent that such Lender is then generally seeking reimbursement or compensation in respect of credit transactions entered into on or after the date hereof similar to the transactions contemplated hereby from borrowers similarly situated to the Borrower to the extent such Act, requests, rules, guidelines or directives are applicable thereto.

(b)           If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or such corporations capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lenders or such corporations policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amounts, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender reasonably promptly after such submission such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
 
(c)           A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if within such six-month period circumstances occur that give rise to such claim having a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b)           The Revolving Commitment of each Non-Extending Lender shall terminate at the close of business on the Revolving Termination Date in effect prior to the delivery of such Extension Request without giving any effect to such proposed extension. In accordance with Section 2.1(e), on such Revolving Termination Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Non-Extending Lender, an amount equal to such Non-Extending Lenders Revolving Loans, together with accrued but unpaid interest and fees thereon and all other amounts then payable hereunder to such Non-Extending Lender. If, however, on or before the date which is 10 days prior to the Revolving Termination Date in effect prior to the delivery of an Extension Request pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Borrower obtains a replacement Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 for any such Non-Extending Lender and such replacement Lender agrees to the extension of the Revolving Termination Date pursuant to this Section 2.17, then such replacement Lender shall for all purposes of this Section 2.17 and this Agreement be deemed to be a Continuing Lender, and the Revolving Loans of such Lender shall not be due and payable pursuant to this Section 2.17(b).
 
Section 2.18           .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:

(b)           the Revolving Commitment and Aggregate Exposure of each Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.1); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby (as set forth in the proviso to Section 10.1);
 
28
 
(c)            if any L/C Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)           provided that no Default or Event of Default exists, all or any part of the L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non- Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Aggregate Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied at such time;
 
(ii)           if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lender only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8 for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding;
 
(iii)           if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure is cash collateralized;
 
(iv)           if the L/C Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.3 and Section 3.3 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and
 
(v)           if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Lender until and to the extent that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
 
(d)           so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding L/C Exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.18(c), and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.18(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Issuing Lender has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuing Lender shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender to defease any risk to the Issuing Lender in respect of such Lender hereunder.
 
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the L/C Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Revolving Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower; that the Borrower shall not be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower to the extent caused by (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender in determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit issued by it complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Lenders willful failure or gross negligence in failing to pay under any Letter of Credit issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event
 
(d)           such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
 
(e)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to such Revolving Loans, on demand, from the Borrower. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Borrower against such Lender.

(f)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.
 
(g)           If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 3.4 or 2.11(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

Requirements of Law
(a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
 
(i)           shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except, in each case, for Excluded Taxes, Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.13 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);
 
(ii)           shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or
 
(iii)           shall impose on such Lender any other condition;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall pay such Lender, reasonably promptly after its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amounts. For purposes of this clause (a) and clause (b) below, (A) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives in connection therewith are deemed to have gone into effect and been adopted on the later of the actual effective date thereof and one

(c)           A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if within such six-month period circumstances occur that give rise to such claim having a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b)           the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Revolving Loans during such Interest Period, then (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Revolving Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans.

(c)           All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
 
(d)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to such Revolving Loans, on demand, from the Borrower.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Borrower against such Lender.
 
(e)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount.  If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.

(f)           If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 3.4 or 2.11(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
 
Section 2.12   
Requirements of Law
.  (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
 
(i)           shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except, in each case, for Excluded Taxes, Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.13 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);
 
(ii)           shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or
 
(iii)           shall impose on such Lender any other condition;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall pay such Lender, reasonably promptly after its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.  If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amounts.  For purposes of this clause (a) and clause (b) below, (A) the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives in connection therewith are deemed to have gone into effect and been adopted on the later of the actual effective date thereof and one (1) Business Day after the effectiveness of this Agreement and (B) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in any Requirement of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued; provided that, as to any Lender seeking reimbursement or compensation hereunder with respect to either of clause (A) or (B) immediately above, such Lender shall only be so reimbursed or compensated to the extent that such Lender is then generally seeking reimbursement or compensation in respect of credit transactions entered into on or after the date hereof similar to the transactions contemplated hereby from borrowers similarly situated to the Borrower to the extent such Act, requests, rules, guidelines or directives are applicable thereto.

(b)           If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or such corporations capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lenders or such corporations policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amounts, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender reasonably promptly after such submission such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
 
(c)           A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if within such six-month period circumstances occur that give rise to such claim having a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.  The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

Indemnity

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Such extension shall be effective with respect to each Lender that, by a written notice in the form of Exhibit E-2 (a ) to the Administrative Agent given no later than 30 days after the applicable Extension Request is given by the Borrower (or such later date as the Borrower shall specify in such Extension Request) (the ), consents, in its sole discretion, to such extension (each Lender giving a Continuation Notice being referred to herein as a  and each Lender other than a Continuing Lender being referred to herein as a ), that (i) such extension shall be effective only if the aggregate Revolving Commitments of the Continuing Lenders constitute at least a majority of the Total Revolving Commitments on the date of the Extension Request, (ii) any Lender that fails to submit a Continuation Notice on or before the applicable Extension Request Response Date shall be deemed not to have consented to such extension and shall constitute a Non-Extending Lender, (iii) not later than ten days prior to the then applicable Revolving Termination Date (prior to giving effect to such requested extension thereof), the Borrower shall have the right to replace any Non-Extending Lender without its consent or acknowledgement on a non-pro-rata basis with one or more Continuing Lenders willing to honor the Borrowers Extension Request on behalf of such Non-Extending Lender (including at a higher or lower Revolving Commitment than such Non-Extending Lenders Revolving Commitment), that after giving effect to such replacement, the Total Revolving Commitments shall be no greater than the Total Revolving Commitments immediately prior to giving effect thereto, subject to any increase in the amount of Revolving Commitments pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and (iv) the Borrower may give only two Extension Requests during the term of this Agreement.

(b)           The Revolving Commitment of each Non-Extending Lender shall terminate at the close of business on the Revolving Termination Date in effect prior to the delivery of such Extension Request without giving any effect to such proposed extension.

Section 2.18   
Defaulting Lenders

(a)           fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.3;

(c)           if any L/C Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)           provided that no Default or Event of Default exists, all or any part of the L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Aggregate Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied at such time;
 
(ii)           if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lender only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8 for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding;

(iii)           if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure is cash collateralized;
 
(iv)           if the L/C Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.3 and Section 3.3 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and
 
(v)           if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Lender until and to the extent that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
 
(d)           so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding L/C Exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.18(c), and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.18(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Issuing Lender has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuing Lender shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender to defease any risk to the Issuing Lender in respect of such Lender hereunder.
 
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the L/C Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Revolving Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

Each L/C Participant agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lenders address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participants Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed.

(b)           If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to an Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360.  If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to an Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans.  A certificate of an Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
 
(c)           Whenever, at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its share thereof; , , that in the event that any such payment received by an Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Lender to it.

No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower; that the Borrower shall not be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower to the extent caused by (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender in determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit issued by it complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Lenders willful failure or gross negligence in failing to pay under any Letter of Credit issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

(a)         the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting  the relevant market, adequate and reasonable  means  do not  exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or
 
(b)         the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Revolving Loans during such Interest Period, then (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Revolving Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans.

(c)         All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
 
(d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to such Revolving Loans, on demand, from the Borrower.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Borrower against such Lender.
 
(e)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount.  If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.

 (ii)          shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or
 
 (iii)         shall impose on such Lender any other condition;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall pay such Lender, reasonably promptly after its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.  If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amounts.  For purposes of this clause (a) and clause (b) below, (A) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives in connection therewith are deemed to have gone into effect and been adopted on the later of the actual effective date thereof and one (1) Business Day after the effectiveness of this Agreement and (B) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in any Requirement of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued; that, as to any Lender seeking reimbursement or compensation hereunder with respect to either of clause (A) or (B) immediately above, such Lender shall only be so reimbursed or compensated to the extent that such Lender is then generally seeking reimbursement or compensation in respect of credit transactions entered into on or after the date hereof similar to the transactions contemplated hereby from borrowers similarly situated to the Borrower to the extent such Act, requests, rules, guidelines or directives are applicable thereto.

(c)         A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if within such six-month period circumstances occur that give rise to such claim having a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.  The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

Each L/C Participant agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lenders address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participants Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed.  Each L/C Participants obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against such Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to an Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans.  A certificate of an Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender.  The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower; that the Borrower shall not be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower to the extent caused by (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender in determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit issued by it complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Lenders willful failure or gross negligence in failing to pay under any Letter of Credit issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to such Revolving Loans, on demand, from the Borrower.

If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.

(ii)       shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or

(b)           If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or such corporations capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lenders or such corporations policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amounts, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender reasonably promptly after such submission such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.

Each L/C Participant agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lenders address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participants Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed.  Each L/C Participants obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against such Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to an Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans.  A certificate of an Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender.  The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower; that the Borrower shall not be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower to the extent caused by (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender in determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit issued by it complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Lenders willful failure or gross negligence in failing to pay under any Letter of Credit issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.
