Minnesota Electric Rate Case
On Nov. 2, 2012, Northern States Power Company (NSP-Minnesota), a Minnesota corporation, filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for an overall increase in annual revenues of approximately $285 million, or 10.7 percent.  The rate filing is based on a 2013 forecast test year and includes a requested return on equity of 10.6 percent, an average electric rate base of approximately $6.3 billion and an equity ratio of 52.56 percent.
Primary drivers of the $285 million request include:
As part of this rate filing, NSP-Minnesota proposed to implement interim electric rates in the amount of approximately $251 million effective Jan. 1, 2013.  On Dec. 13, 2012, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete, approved the interim rates as requested to become effective Jan. 1, 2013, subject to refund, and referred the case to the Office of Administrative Hearings for a contested case proceeding.  Regulators will evaluate the rate case request and the MPUC is anticipated to make a decision in fall 2013.
