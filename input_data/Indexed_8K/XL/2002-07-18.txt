Scotton Investor Relations Media Relations 441-294-7104 441-294-7165 XL CAPITAL ANNOUNCES RESERVE INCREASE FOR SEPTEMBER 11 CLAIMS AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT LOSSES HAMILTON, BERMUDA (July 18, 2002) - XL Capital Ltd (NYSE: XL) ("XL" or the "Company") announced today that it is increasing reserves for losses relating to the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001 by approximately $200 million in the second quarter of 2002. In addition, the Company expects to report net investment losses of approximately $120 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2002 largely due to investments in certain telecommunications companies. Mr. Brian M. O'Hara, President and Chief Executive Officer of XL, commented: "Despite our intensive reserve analysis immediately following September 11, the unprecedented nature of the attacks has resulted in higher losses as information has developed. We believe that increasing our reserves at this time should fully address our exposure to September 11." The increase in the net loss reserves for September 11 claims consists of approximately $135 million of additional reserves in the Company's reinsurance segment, primarily due to higher business interruption losses and exposure to Lloyd's Central Fund, and about $65 million in the accident and health book of the Company's Lloyd's operations. The increase in reserves in the accident and health book at Lloyd's reflected that the Company's exposure ultimately included a higher concentration of victims in the World Trade Center than previously indicated. Net investment losses in the quarter include losses in the Company's fixed income portfolio for WorldCom, Adelphia and other telecommunication companies of approximately $92 million and the writedown of the Company's investment in Mutual Risk Management of approximately $20
million. In addition, investment losses include derivative losses and other investment losses net of realized investment gains. "I am pleased to note that we had minimal underwriting exposure in both our insurance and reinsurance operations to the telecommunications and related industries during the quarter," Mr. O'Hara added. Mr. O'Hara stated, "Absent the impact of these charges, we believe our second quarter results should be in line with consensus analyst estimates. I am confident that the recovery underway in the insurance and reinsurance markets is sustainable for the foreseeable future and believe that the need for higher prices is reinforced by the adverse development of recent losses and declines in the investment markets." The Company intends to announce its second quarter results after the market close on July 30, 2002 and will host a webcast investor conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on July 31, 2002. This webcast will be accessible via the Company's website at www.xlcapital.com.
