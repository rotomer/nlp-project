If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Company may grant to the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of shares, specified in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "Optional Shares"). The Firm Shares and the Optional Shares, if any, which the Underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to Section 3 hereof are herein collectively called the "Designated Shares". The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Shares shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto. 1. Particular sales of Designated Shares may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Shares, for whom the firms designated as
representatives of the Underwriters of such Shares in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Shares or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Shares. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Shares and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Shares shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate number of the Firm Shares, the maximum number of Optional Shares, if any, the initial public offering price of such Firm and Optional Shares or the manner of determining such price, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Shares, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Shares, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the number of such Designated Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Firm and Optional Shares, if any, and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Shares. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2.

The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Shares under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares are, at and as of each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Shares; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction; (b) Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in 11
Annex II, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) Cahill Gordon & Reindel, United States counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex III; (d) Hunter & Hunter, Cayman Islands counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex IV; (e) Paul S. Giordano, Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his written opinion or opinions, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex V; (f) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Shares and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent accountants of the Company who have certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives; (g) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than changes resulting from the exercise of share or over-allotment options or the conversion of warrants or capital stock which were outstanding as of such date, or from the exercise of options granted after such date in the ordinary course of business or from repurchases of capital stock) or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; (h) At each Time of Delivery, the Shares shall be rated at least "A3" by Moody's and "A-" by S&P, and the Company shall have delivered to the Representatives a letter dated on, 12
or prior to, such Time of Delivery, from each such rating agency, or other evidence satisfactory to the Representatives confirming that the Shares have such ratings. On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preference ordinary shares or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preference ordinary shares or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability; (i) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange (the "Exchange"); (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda declared by the relevant authority or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda or the declaration by the United States, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives is so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; (v) a change or development involving a prospective change in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda taxation affecting the Company, the Designated Shares or the transfer thereof or the imposition of exchange controls by the United States, Bermuda or the Cayman Islands or (vi) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or currency exchange rates or controls in the United States, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (vi) in the judgment of the Representatives is so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; (j) The Shares at each Time of Delivery shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the Exchange; (k) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares; (l) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Shares certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to 13
such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) relating to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and no stop orders, the matters set forth in subsections (h) and (i) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request; and (m) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal expenses of one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) engaged reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Shares through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus. (a) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel (in addition to any applicable local counsel). 14
(b) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation (except as set forth below). Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Shares on the other from the offering of the Designated Shares to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect 15
not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Shares on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Shares in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Shares and not joint. (d) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Shares or Optional Shares which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Shares, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties satisfactory to the Company to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged 16
for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Shares for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Shares. (a) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Shares or the Over-allotment Option relating to such Optional Shares, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares. 17
11. If any Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Shares or Optional Shares with respect to which such Pricing Agreement shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 6, 8 and 19 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Designated Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Shares, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Shares except as provided in Sections 6, 8 and 19 hereof. 12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Shares shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its principal address, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon written request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. The Company irrevocably (i) agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding against the Company brought by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter arising out of or based upon this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and (iii) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. The Company has appointed CT Corporation System, New York, New York, as its authorized agent (the "Authorized Agent") upon whom process may be served in any such action arising out of or based on this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby which may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County 18
Court by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter, expressly consents to the jurisdiction of any such court in respect of any such action, and waives any other requirements of or objections to personal jurisdiction with respect thereto. Such appointment shall be irrevocable. The Company represents and warrants that the Authorized Agent has agreed to act as such agent for service of process and agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents and instruments, that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect as aforesaid. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent and written notice of such service to the Company shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon the Company. 15. Time shall be of the essence in each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 18. The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. 19. In respect of any judgment or order given or made for any amount due hereunder or under any Pricing Agreement that is expressed and paid in a currency (the "judgment currency") other than United States dollars, the Company will indemnify each Underwriter against any loss incurred by such Underwriter as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the United States dollar amount is converted into the judgment currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and (ii) the rate of exchange at which an Underwriter is able to purchase United States dollars with the amount of judgment currency actually received by such Underwriter. The foregoing indemnity shall constitute a separate and independent obligation of the Company and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order aforesaid. The term "rate of exchange" shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into United States dollars.

On and after November 18, 2007, the Company, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior written notice, may redeem the Designated Shares, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of $25 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the date of redemption, without interest on such unpaid dividends. At any time prior to November 18, 2007, if the Company shall have: o submitted to the holders of its ordinary shares a proposal for an amalgamation, consolidation, merger, arrangement, reconstruction,
reincorporation, deregistration or any other similar transaction involving the Company that requires, or o submitted any proposal for any other matter that, as a result of any change in Cayman Islands law after the date of this Pricing Agreement (whether by enactment or official interpretation) requires, in each case, a vote of the holders of the Designated Shares at the time outstanding voting separately as a single class (alone or with one or more class or series of preference ordinary shares), then the Company will have the option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice to redeem all of the outstanding Designated Shares for cash at a redemption price of $26 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the date of redemption, without interest on such unpaid dividends. In addition, the Company shall have the option to redeem for cash the Designated Shares at any time, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice, at a redemption price of $25 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the date of redemption, without interest on such unpaid dividends, if there is a "change in tax law" that would require the Company or any successor company to pay additional amounts with respect to the Designated Shares on the next succeeding dividend payment date, and the payment of those additional amounts cannot be avoided by the use of any reasonable measures available to the Company or any successor company. For the purposes of this provision, a "change in tax law" shall be (a) a change in or amendment to laws, regulations or rulings of any jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority described in the next sentence, (b) a change in the official application or interpretation of those laws, regulations or rulings, or (c) any execution of or amendment to any treaty affecting taxation to which any jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority described in the next sentence is party after November 13, 2002. The jurisdictions, political subdivisions and taxing authorities referred to in the previous sentence are (a) the Cayman Islands or any political subdivision or governmental authority of or in the Cayman Islands with the power to tax, (b) any jurisdiction from or through which the Company or its paying agent is making payments on the Designated Shares or any political subdivision or governmental authority of or in that jurisdiction with the power to tax, or (c) any other jurisdiction in which the Company or its successor company is organized or generally subject to taxation or any political subdivision or governmental authority of or in that jurisdiction with the power to tax, as more fully described under the caption "Description of the Series B Preference Shares - Tax Redemption" in the Prospectus Supplement, dated November 13, 2002, with respect to the Designated Shares. Furthermore, the Company shall have the option to redeem for cash the Designated Shares at any time, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice, at a redemption price of $25 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the date of redemption, without interest on such unpaid dividends, if the entity formed by a consolidation,
merger or amalgamation involving the Company or the entity to which the Company conveys, transfers or leases substantially all of its properties and assets is required to pay additional amounts in respect of any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed on any holder of Designated Shares as a result of a change in tax law that occurred after the date of the consolidation, merger, amalgamation, conveyance, transfer or lease and the payment of those amounts cannot be avoided by the use of any reasonable measures available to the Company or such successor, as more fully described under the caption "Description of the Series B Preference Shares - Tax Redemption" in the Prospectus Supplement, dated November 13, 2002, with respect to the Designated Shares (the "Prospectus Supplement"). Dividend Rate: 7.625% of the liquidation preference per annum (equal to $1.90625 per share) Dividend Payment Dates: March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning December 31, 2002 Conversion Provisions: None Other Terms: Generally, the Shares have no voting rights. Whenever dividends payable on the Shares are in arrears (whether or not such dividends have been earned or declared) in an aggregate amount equivalent to dividends for six full dividend periods (whether or not consecutive), the holders of Shares, voting as a single class with all other series of the preference ordinary shares that are also in arrears and have such a right, will have the right to elect two persons who will then be appointed as additional directors to the Company's Board of Directors. Whenever all arrearages in dividends on the Shares have been paid in full, then the right of holders of the Shares to be represented by directors will cease (but subject always to the same provision for the vesting of such rights in the case of any future arrearages in an amount equivalent to dividends for six full dividend periods). Without the sanction of a special resolution passed by the holders of the Shares, the Company may not take any action which would vary the rights attached to the Shares unless the Shares have been previously redeemed or called for redemption. Payments on the Shares shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, assessments or other governmental charges imposed by any jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority described in the second paragraph under "Redemption Provisions", unless the deduction or withholding of such taxes, assessments or other governmental charges is required by law, regulations or rulings or the application or official interpretation of such law, regulations or rulings. In that event, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid additional amounts to the registered holders of the Shares as additional dividends to make up for any deduction or withholding for any present or future taxes, assessments or other governmental charges imposed by any jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority described in the second paragraph under "Redemption Provisions" in respect of any amounts that the Company or a successor company must pay with respect to the Shares, so that the net amounts paid to the holders of the Shares, after that deduction
or withholding, shall equal the respective amounts that would have been receivable by such holders had no such withholding or deduction been required. However, the Company shall not be obligated to pay additional amounts to any holder in limited circumstances, as more fully described under the caption "Description of the Series B Preference Shares - Additional Amounts" in the Prospectus Supplement.

Series B Preference Ordinary Shares 1. RESOLVED that, a class of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company be designated as "Series B Preference Ordinary Shares". The Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall be cumulative preference ordinary shares with a nominal value of US$0.01 and, subject to the Articles and the provisions of and restrictions contained in the Companies Law (2002 Revision) and every statutory modification or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force (the "Law"), shall have the following preferences and rights and shall be subject to the following restrictions: (a) Liquidation Preference. On any voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise of the Company, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution among shareholders shall be applied first in repaying to the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares (the "Holders") an amount equal to US$25.00 per Series B Preference Ordinary Share (inclusive of the nominal amount thereof) plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared), if any, to the date fixed for distribution, in preference to the repayment of such nominal amount of and any share premium or other amounts paid on the Class A Ordinary Shares and the Class B Ordinary Shares (together, the "Ordinary Shares") or any other shares ranking junior in right of payment to the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares as to the voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise of the Company or as to dividends (including the Ordinary Shares, the "Junior Shares") to the holders of such Junior Shares, without interest on such unpaid dividends. In the event that upon any such voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise, the assets of the Company available are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidation distributions on all outstanding Series B Preference Ordinary Shares as referred to above and the corresponding amounts payable on all other shares ranking pari passu with the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts upon any voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise of the Company (including, without limitation, the Series A Preference Ordinary Shares) ("Parity Shares"), then the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and all such Parity Shares shall share
-2- ratably in such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. The Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall not be convertible into or exchangeable for any other shares of the Company. (b) Dividend Rights. (i) The holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive cumulative preferential cash dividends in respect of their Series B Preference Ordinary Shares at the percentage rate per annum on their liquidation value specified by the Attorneys (as defined below) (or by either of them) on the date of pricing of such shares (the "Pricing Date"). Such dividends shall be payable in arrears in equal amounts (except as set forth below with respect to the initial dividend period) on 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December when and if declared by the Directors in each year or, if such date is not a day on which banks are authorised to open for business in New York and Bermuda (a "Business Day"), on the Business Day immediately after such date. Such dividends will begin to accrue and will be cumulative from the date of original issuance. The first dividend, which if declared will be payable on 31 March 2003, will represent the period of time from and will accrue from the date of original issuance up to 31 March 2003. The dividend for such initial period and any other dividend payable on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares for any partial dividend period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve (12) 30-day months. Dividends will be payable to holders of record as they appear in the Company's register of members at the close of business on the applicable record date, which will be one day prior to the dividend payment date as long as all of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares remain in book-entry form. If any of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares are not in book-entry form, the record date will be 15 days prior to the dividend payment date (whether or not such date is a Business Day). Holders of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares will not be entitled to any dividends in excess of full cumulative dividends as described above. Dividends on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares will accrue and will be fully cumulative, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not the dividends are declared. No interest or sum of money in lieu of interest will be payable on any dividend
-3- payment or on any payment on Series B Preference Ordinary Shares which is in arrears. Any dividend payment made on Series B Preference Ordinary Shares will first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due with respect to Series B Preference Ordinary Shares which remains payable. (ii) As long as any Series B Preference Ordinary Shares are outstanding, no dividends or other distributions may be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any class or series of Parity Shares for any period unless either (1) full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payments on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares for all dividend periods terminating on or prior to the dividend payment date on such Parity Shares, or (2) all dividends declared upon the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and any Parity Shares are declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and any Parity Shares will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and such Parity Shares bear to each other. (iii) As long as any Series B Preference Ordinary Shares are outstanding (1) no dividends (other than those paid in Ordinary Shares or other shares ranking junior in right of payment to the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares as to dividends and as to any voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise of the Company (including the Ordinary Shares, "Fully Junior Shares")) may be declared or paid or set apart for payment upon any Junior Shares, (2) no other distribution (other than those paid in Fully Junior Shares) may be declared or paid or set apart for payment upon any Junior Shares and (3) no Junior Shares will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (other than a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of Ordinary Shares made for purposes of any employee incentive, stock, benefit or any similar plan of the Company or any of its subsidiaries) for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund or the redemption of any Junior Shares) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for Fully Junior Shares), unless, in any such case, full cumulative dividends on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and any Parity Shares have
-4- been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment, for all dividend periods terminating on or prior to the date such dividends or distributions are declared or paid on the Junior Shares, or such Junior Shares are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired. (c) Voting Rights. (i) Subject to clause (iii) below, and unless required by law or court order, the holders of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall not be entitled to receive notice of nor to attend nor to vote at any general meeting of the Company. (ii) The holders of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to one vote for each share held at any separate general meeting of that class or series (i.e., preference ordinary shares or Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, respectively), subject to the provisions of Article 41 of the Articles. Subject to the applicable provisions of the Articles and the Law, unless the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares have been previously redeemed or called for redemption (and funds necessary for such redemption have been set apart by the Company in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares so called for redemption), the Company may not take any action which would vary the rights attached to the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and no class or series of shares may be created which ranks senior to the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares as to dividend rights or as to the return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise of the Company, in each case, without the approval of a special resolution in writing by the holders of 100% of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares or the sanction of a special resolution passed by the votes of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Series B Preference Ordinary Shares cast at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares. At every separate meeting of the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons present in person or by proxy holding not less than 50% of the issued shares of that class. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the applicable
-5- provisions of the Articles and the Law, holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares are not entitled to vote on any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, and the issuance of any shares that are in parity with the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares with respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets in liquidation. (iii) If at any time the equivalent of six (6) or more full quarterly dividends (whether consecutive or not) on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall be in arrears (whether or not such dividends shall have been earned or declared), then during such period until all such arrearages in dividends shall have been paid in full, and only during such period (the "Voting Period"), the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares voting together with any other series or classes of preference ordinary shares also in arrears and having such right shall be entitled by ordinary resolution at a separate meeting of such holders to elect two persons and nominate such elected persons for appointment by the Board of Directors as additional Directors of the Company. In no event shall there be more than two Directors elected by the holders of preference ordinary shares (whether voting alone as a series or class or with another series or class so in arrears and having such right). (iv) Any Director who shall have been elected pursuant to paragraph (2)(c)(iii) above may be removed at any time during a Voting Period, either for or without cause, by, and only by, ordinary resolution of the holders of the outstanding preference ordinary shares of the relevant series at a special separate general meeting of such holders called for that purpose. Any vacancy thereby created may be filled during such Voting Period by ordinary resolution of the holders of preference ordinary shares of all the relevant series at such a meeting. Any Director elected by holders of preference ordinary shares pursuant to this provision, or by any Director so elected as herein contemplated, who dies, resigns or otherwise ceases to be a Director during a Voting Period shall, except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence, be replaced by the
-6- remaining Director theretofore elected by the holders of preference ordinary shares nominating a replacement for appointment by the Board of Directors, provided that if no remaining additional Director is then in office, additional Directors will be elected in accordance with the procedures described above. At the end of the Voting Period, the holders of preference ordinary shares of all of the relevant series shall be automatically divested of all voting powers vested in them by this provision, but subject always to subsequent vesting of such voting power in the holders of preference ordinary shares in the event of any similar cumulated arrearage in payment of quarterly dividends occurring thereafter. The term of all Directors elected and appointed pursuant to this provision shall in all events expire at the end of the applicable Voting Period and if the size of the Board was increased for purpose of the additional Directors, the number of Directors constituting the Board shall be reduced accordingly. The provisions of the Articles relating to general meetings and the provisions of Article 41 of the Articles shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to every such separate meeting, except that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons present in person or by proxy holding not less than fifty percent (50%) of the issued preference ordinary shares of the relevant series. (d) Redemption. The Company shall be entitled to redeem all or any of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares as follows: (i) Subject to clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall not be redeemable by the Company prior to the date to be determined by the Attorneys (or by either of them) on the Pricing Date. On or after such date, the Company shall be entitled at any time in whole or from time to time in part by not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the relevant Holders, in such form and given in such manner as the Directors shall from time to time determine and in accordance with paragraph (e) below, to redeem all or any of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares pursuant to this clause for cash at a redemption price of US$25.00 per share being redeemed (inclusive of the nominal value
-7- thereof) plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, thereon to the date of redemption, without interest on such unpaid dividends. (ii) At any time prior to the date determined by the Attorneys (or by either of them) on the Pricing Date, if the Company shall have submitted to the holders of Ordinary Shares a proposal for an amalgamation, consolidation, merger, arrangement, reconstruction, reincorporation, de-registration or any other similar transaction involving the Company that requires or shall have submitted any proposal for any other matter that, as a result of any change in Cayman Islands Law after 13 November 2002 (whether by enactment or official interpretation), requires, in each case, a vote of the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares voting separately as a single class (alone or with one or more class or series of preference ordinary shares, including the Company's Series A Preference Ordinary Shares), the Company shall be entitled by not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior written notice to the relevant Holders, in such form and given in such manner as the Directors shall from time to time determine and in accordance with paragraph (e) below, to redeem all Series B Preference Ordinary Shares pursuant to this clause for cash at a redemption price of US$26.00 per share being redeemed (inclusive of the nominal value thereof), plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the date of redemption. (iii) If there is a "change in tax law" that would require the Company or any successor company to pay additional amounts with respect to the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares on the next succeeding dividend payment date, and the payment of those additional amounts cannot be avoided by the use of any reasonable measures available to the Company or any successor company, the Company shall be entitled at any time thereafter by not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior written notice to the relevant Holders, in such form and given in such manner as the Directors shall from time to time determine
-8- and in accordance with paragraph (e) below, to redeem any or all Series B Preference Ordinary Shares pursuant to this clause for cash at a redemption price of US$25.00 per share being redeemed (inclusive of the nominal value thereof) plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the date of redemption. For the purposes of this provision, a "change in tax law" shall be (a) a change in or amendment to laws, regulations or rulings of any jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority described in the next sentence, (b) a change in the official application or interpretation of those laws, regulations or rulings, or (c) any execution of or amendment to any treaty affecting taxation to which any jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority described in the next sentence is party after 13 November 2002. The jurisdictions, political subdivisions and taxing authorities referred to in the previous sentence are (a) the Cayman Islands or any political subdivision or governmental authority of or in the Cayman Islands with the power to tax, (b) any jurisdiction from or through which the Company or its paying agent is making payments on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares or any political subdivision or governmental authority of or in that jurisdiction with the power to tax, or (c) any other jurisdiction in which the Company or its successor company is organized or generally subject to taxation or any political subdivision or governmental authority of or in that jurisdiction with the power to tax. (iv) If the entity formed by a consolidation, merger or amalgamation involving the Company or the entity to which the Company conveys, transfers or leases substantially all of its properties and assets is required to pay additional amounts in respect of any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed on any holder of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares as a result of a change in tax law that occurred after the date of the consolidation, merger, amalgamation, conveyance, transfer or lease, and the payment of those amounts cannot be avoided by the use of any reasonable measures available to the Company or any successor company, the Company shall be entitled at any time thereafter by not less than thirty (30) days nor
-9- more than sixty (60) days prior written notice to the relevant Holders, in such form and given in such manner as the Directors shall from time to time determine and in accordance with paragraph (e) below, to redeem any or all Series B Preference Ordinary Shares pursuant to this clause for cash at a redemption price of US$25.00 per share being redeemed, (inclusive of the nominal value thereof), plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the date of redemption. (e) Notice of any redemption described herein will be mailed at least thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days before the redemption date to each holder of record of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares to be redeemed at the address shown in the register of members of the Company. Each notice will state as appropriate: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares to be redeemed; (3) the redemption price; (4) the place or places where certificates for Series B Preference Ordinary Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price if any such certificates are outstanding; and (5) where applicable, that dividends on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date. If fewer than all Series B Preference Ordinary Shares are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to each such holder thereof will also specify the number of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares to be redeemed from such holder. The notice shall contain (i) the name and address of the relevant bank or trust company to be used for purposes of redemption (if any) and (ii) a statement as to the deposit or intent to deposit the redemption funds in such trust account. (f) If fewer than all of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed will be determined by the Directors in their absolute discretion and such Series B Preference Ordinary Shares may be redeemed pro rata from the holders of record in proportion to the number of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares held by such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares) or by lot. (g) If notice of redemption of any Series B Preference Ordinary Shares has been given and if the funds necessary for such
-10- redemption have been set apart by the Company in trust for the benefit of the holders of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares so called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares being redeemed, the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. (h) If a redemption date falls after a dividend record date and prior to the corresponding dividend payment date, the holders of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares at the close of business on the dividend record date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable with respect to such Series B Preference Ordinary Shares on the corresponding dividend payment date notwithstanding the redemption thereof between the dividend record date and the corresponding dividend payment date or a default in the payment of the dividend due on such dividend payement date. (i) Unless full cumulative dividends on all Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and all Parity Shares shall have been declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past dividend periods terminating on or prior to the date of a redemption, purchase or other acquisition, no Series B Preference Ordinary Shares or any Parity Shares may be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company unless all Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and any Parity Shares are redeemed; provided, that, the Company may acquire fewer than all of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares or any Parity Shares pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and Parity Shares as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company. (j) The Company, subject to (1) the special rights granted to any of the Company's issued and outstanding shares and (2) the Company's requirement pursuant to clause (i) to make a purchase or exchange offering on the same terms to holders of all outstanding Series B Preference Ordinary Shares and Parity Shares, may purchase Series B Preference Ordinary Shares. Any such purchase made by the Company may be made in the open market,
-11- by tender to all holders of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, by private agreement or otherwise as the Directors see fit. Any Series B Preference Ordinary Shares purchased by the Company for its own account (other than in the ordinary course of business of dealing in securities) will be canceled by the Company and will no longer be issued and outstanding. (k) The Series B Preference Ordinary Shares may be purchased or redeemed by the Company either out of profits or from the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares or out of capital or the share premium account. (l) Payment of the redemption amount shall only be effected upon surrender to the Company for cancellation of any share certificate in respect of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares (to the extent such certificates are outstanding) to be redeemed and shall be made as promptly as practicable. If any certificate so surrendered includes Series B Preference Ordinary Shares not being redeemed, a new certificate for the remaining Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall be issued to the holder in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company without charge to such holder. (m) The Directors may make such further regulations concerning the administerial process of redemption as they shall from time to time deem necessary so long as the rights of the Holders are not varied. (n) The rights conferred upon the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall not be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of any Parity Shares, Junior Shares or Fully Junior Shares. (o) Payments of Additional Amounts. Payments on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, assessments or other governmental charges imposed by any jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority described in clause 1(d)(iii) of these Resolutions, unless the deduction or withholding of such taxes, assessments or other governmental charges is required by law, regulations or
-12- rulings or the application or official interpretation of such law, regulations or rulings. In that event, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid additional amounts to the registered holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares as additional dividends to make up for any deduction or withholding for any present or future taxes, assessments or other governmental charges imposed by any jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority described in clause 1(d)(iii) of these Resolutions in respect of any amounts that the Company or a successor company must pay with respect to the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, so that the net amounts paid to the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, after that deduction or withholding, shall equal the respective amounts that would have been receivable by such holders had no such withholding or deduction been required. However, the Company shall not be obligated to pay additional amounts to any holder that: (i) resides in or is a citizen of the jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority imposing the taxes, assessments or other governmental charges that would otherwise trigger the Company's obligation to pay additional amounts; or (ii) is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other pass-thru entity if, and to the extent that, the payment of additional amounts would be required by a jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority described in clause 1(d)(iii) of these Resolutions to be included in the income for tax purposes of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to that fiduciary or a member of that partnership, limited liability company or other pass-thru entity who would not have been entitled to any additional amounts had that beneficiary, settlor or member held those Series B Preference Ordinary Shares directly. In addition, the Company shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts to a holder of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares on account of: (i) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the holder, or certain other persons, and the taxing jurisdiction or political subdivision, or any Series B Preference
-13- Ordinary Shares presented for payment more than thirty (30) days after the Relevant Date; (ii) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (iii) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from payment of the liquidation preference of or any dividends on the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares; (iv) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the holder or the beneficial owner of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares to promptly comply with a request by the Company to (a) provide information, documents, certifications or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or beneficial owner or (b) make and deliver any declaration or other similar claim, other than a claim for refund of a tax, assessment or other governmental charge withheld by the Company, or satisfy any information or reporting requirements, which, in the case of clauses (a) or (b), is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the taxing jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of that tax, assessment or other governmental charge; or (v) any combination of the items identified by the subparagraphs above. The "Relevant Date" means, in respect of any payment, the date on which such payment first becomes due and payable, but if the full amount of the moneys payable has not been received by the depositary on or prior to such due date, it means the first date on which, the full amount of such moneys having been so received and being available for payment to holders, notice to that effect shall have been duly given to the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares.
-14- (p) No Preemptive Rights. The Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall not be entitled to the benefits of any retirement or sinking fund. No holder of Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, solely by reason of any such holding, has or will have any preemptive right to subscribe for any additional issue of the Company's shares of any class or series or to any security convertible into any such shares. (q) Ranking. Any class or series of shares of the Company shall be deemed to rank (1) prior to the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, as to the payment of dividends and as to any voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise of the Company, if the holders of such class or series shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon any voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, (2) on a parity with the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares as to the payment of dividends and as to distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise of the Company, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof shall be different from those of the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, if the holders of such class or series and the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends and of amounts distributable upon any voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise of the Company in proportion to their respective amounts of accrued and unpaid dividends per share or liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the other or (3) junior to the Series B Preference Ordinary Shares, as to the payment of dividends and as to distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise of the Company, if such class or series is ordinary shares or other shares ranking junior in right of payment to Series B Preference Ordinary Shares as to dividends and/or as to the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary return of assets on liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise of the Company. The Series B Preference Ordinary Shares will rank on a parity with the Series A Preference Ordinary Shares as to the payment of dividends and
