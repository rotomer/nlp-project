Net operating income for the first quarter of 2003 was $250.1 million, or $1.82 per ordinary share, compared with net operating income of $207.6 million, or $1.51 per ordinary share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 (see below for a reconciliation to net income). Commenting on the first quarter 2003 results, Brian M. O'Hara, President and Chief Executive Officer of XL, stated: "We had a very strong first quarter with excellent underwriting results reflected in our combined ratio of 86.1% and net earned premium growth of 42% in our general insurance and reinsurance operations. Our net operating income return on ordinary shareholders' equity exceeded 16% and book value per ordinary share increased to $46.09, a record level for XL." 1
"Our general insurance and reinsurance businesses continue to see very strong pricing, most notably in casualty, professional lines and marine worldwide," said Mr. O'Hara. Mr. O'Hara further stated, "Despite our very robust underwriting results and strong cash flow during the quarter, the investment environment continues to be challenging with reinvestment rates at extremely low levels. This will continue to put pressure on industry results and underscores the need to maintain underwriting discipline in the market." The first quarter 2003 net operating results include a write down of the Company's investment in Annuity and Life Re Holdings Ltd of $40.9 million. Total assets as of March 31, 2003 were $37.5 billion compared with $35.6 billion as of December 31, 2002. Book value per ordinary share as at March 31, 2003 increased to $46.09 compared with $44.48 as at December 31, 2002.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about XL's beliefs, plans or expectations, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates, and expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them. A non-exclusive list of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements includes the following: (a) rate increases and improvements in terms and conditions may not be as large or sustainable as XL is currently projecting; (b) greater frequency or severity of claims and loss activity, including as a result of natural or man-made catastrophic events, than XL's underwriting, reserving or investment practices anticipate based on historical experience or industry data; (c) developments in the world's financial and capital markets which adversely affect the performance of XL's investments and XL's access to such markets; (d) changes in general economic conditions, including foreign currency exchange rates, inflation and other factors; and (e) the other factors set forth in XL's most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as XL's other documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. XL undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. 4
Note: a) Certain reclassifications, which have no effect on net income, have been made to prior period results to conform to current presentation. 5
Net operating income is a non-GAAP measure. As calculated by the Company, net operating income is net income available to ordinary shareholders, excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on all derivatives (except for gains and losses on weather and energy risk management derivatives). These items are excluded because they are not considered by management to be relevant indicators of the performance of or trends in XL's core business operations, but rather of the investment and credit markets in general. Management believes that the presentation of net operating income provides useful information regarding XL's results of operations because it follows industry practice, is followed closely by securities analysts and rating agencies, and enables investors and securities analysts to make performance comparisons with XL's peers in the insurance industry. This measure may not however be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside of the insurance industry. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on net operating income as a non-GAAP measure in assessing XL's overall financial performance. 6
