See below for a reconciliation of this measure to net income available to ordinary shareholders. Commenting on the second quarter 2003 results, Brian M. O'Hara, President and Chief Executive Officer of XL, stated: "We had a strong quarter with net income, total assets and shareholders' equity reaching record levels. Cash flow from operations was a robust $952 million for the second quarter. Adding the $669 million in XL Life and Annuity transactions this quarter increased cash flow to $1.6 billion. Net premiums earned from general operations increased by more than 40% compared with the 1
second quarter a year ago and we achieved satisfactory combined ratios of 92.2% in the second quarter and 89.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2003." "We are strategically positioned in all of the business lines and regions where we want to be and continue to capitalize on the current strong market conditions in our areas of focus," stated Mr. O'Hara. "We are particularly well-placed in those lines of business which are still seeing the largest rate increases, notably professional lines and casualty worldwide which currently comprise nearly half of our general operations' portfolio. The Company's life and annuity businesses and our financial operations also performed well and both areas are gaining momentum." Mr. O'Hara also commented: "We were also pleased with our total investment earnings, comprising both investment income and our equity in the earnings of our investment affiliates, of $224.9 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2003, as compared with $182.7 million in the prior year's quarter." For the six months ended June 30, 2003, net income available to ordinary shareholders was $587.5 million, or $4.25 per ordinary share, compared with a net loss of $2.3 million, or $0.02 per ordinary share, in the six months ended June 30, 2002. `Net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax' for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $518.7 million, or $3.76 per ordinary share, compared with $234.0 million, or $1.70 per ordinary share, for the six months ended June 30, 2002. See below for the reconciliation of `net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax' to net income available to ordinary shareholders. Total assets as of June 30, 2003 were $39.2 billion compared with $35.6 billion as of December 31, 2002. Book value per ordinary share as at June 30, 2003 increased to $51.40 compared with $44.48 as at December 31, 2002. 2

XL CAPITAL LTD RECONCILIATION The following is a reconciliation of the Company's net income (loss) to `net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax' for the three and six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 (in millions except per share amounts): 8
Comment on Regulation G This press release contains the presentation of `net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivatives, net of tax'. This presentation is a "non-GAAP financial measure" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measure to net income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) in accordance with Regulation G is included above. XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance. This presentation includes the use of `net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivatives, net of tax'. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below). Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XL's operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XL's financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, capital gains are largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL generally holds its financial guarantee contracts written in credit derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance of XL's financial guarantee operations. Unlike these credit derivatives, XL's weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e, they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business. In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income, XL believes that showing net income exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income makes it much more difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies who follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis. 9
