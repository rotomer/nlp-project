Total annual distributions on the equity security units will be at the rate of 6.50 percent, consisting of interest payments at the rate of 2.53 percent on the senior notes and contract adjustment payments at the rate of 3.97 percent under the forward purchase contracts. The underwriters for XL's equity security unit offering are Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the equity security units or any other securities, nor will there be any sale of the equity security units or any other securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is not permitted.
