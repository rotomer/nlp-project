(k) If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Company shall file a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement with the Commission in compliance with Rule 462(b) by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Units, and the Company shall at the time of filing either pay the Commission the filing fee for the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or give irrevocable instructions for the payment of such fee pursuant to Rule 111(b) under the Act. 6. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters, subject to any agreements between the Company and the Representatives relating to expenses, that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Units under the Act and the issuance and sale of the Designated Units and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and any amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, any Indenture, any Remarketing Agreement, any Purchase Contract Agreement, any Purchase Contracts, any Pledge Agreement, any Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including compilations thereof); (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Units for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Underlying Notes; (v) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required reviews by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Units; (vi) the cost of preparing the Units, the Underlying Notes and certificates for the Underlying Shares; (vii) the fees and expenses of any Trustee, any Purchase Contract Agent, any Collateral Agent, any Custodial Agent, any Securities Intermediary, any Remarketing Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, Dividend Disbursing Agent, or any Calculation Agent and any agent of any Trustee, Purchase Contract Agent, Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent, Securities Intermediary, Remarketing Agent, Registrar, Transfer Agent, Dividend Disbursing Agent, or Calculation Agent and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any such persons in connection with any Indenture, any Remarketing Agreement, any Purchase Contract Agreement, any Purchase Contracts and any Pledge Agreement; (viii) the cost and charges of any transfer agent or registrar or dividend disbursing agent; (ix) all expenses and taxes arising as a result of the issuance, sale and delivery of the Designated Units, of the sale and delivery outside of the Cayman Islands of the Designated Units by the Underwriters to the initial purchasers thereof in the manner contemplated under this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement, including, in any such case, any Cayman Islands income, capital gains, withholding, transfer or other tax asserted against a Underwriter by reason of the purchase and sale of the Designated Units pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement; (x) any cost incurred in connection with the listing of the Designated Units or the Underlying Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; and (xi) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, under any Pricing Agreement and under any options to purchase additional Units which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 8, 11 and 19 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Units by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make. 13
7. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Units under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Units shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Units are, at and as of each Time of Delivery for such Designated Units, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to such Designated Units shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Units; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction; (b) Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions and letter, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex II-1 and Annex II-2, respectively, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, United States counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions and letter, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex III-1 and Annex III-2, respectively; (d) Hunter & Hunter, Cayman Islands counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex IV; (e) Paul S. Giordano, Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his written opinion or opinions, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex V; (f) White & Case, counsel to U.S. Bank National Association, as Purchase Contract Agent and Collateral Agent, shall have furnished their written opinion or opinions dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives in the form attached hereto in Annex VI; (g) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Units and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Units, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent 14
accountants of the Company who have certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives; (h) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Units any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Units, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Units, there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than changes resulting from the exercise of share or over-allotment options or the conversion of warrants or capital stock which were outstanding as of such date, or from the exercise of options granted after such date in the ordinary course of business or from repurchases of capital stock) or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Units, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Units on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Units; (i) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Units (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) other than any announcements made prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement, no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability; (j) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Units there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange (the "Exchange"); (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda declared by the relevant authority or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda or the declaration by the United States, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the 15
judgment of the Representatives is so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Units on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Units; (v) a change or development involving a prospective change in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda taxation affecting the Company, the Designated Units or the transfer thereof or the imposition of exchange controls by the United States, Bermuda or the Cayman Islands or (vi) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or currency exchange rates or controls in the United States, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (vi) in the judgment of the Representatives is so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Units on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Units; (k) The Units and the Underlying Shares at each Time of Delivery shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the Exchange; (l) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Units; (m) The Company shall have obtained and delivered to the Underwriters executed copies of a lock-up agreement from each person listed in Section 5(f) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives; (n) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Units certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) relating to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and no stop orders, the matters set forth in subsections (h) and (i) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request; and (o) Prior to each Time of Delivery, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Units, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal expenses of one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) engaged reasonably incurred by such 16
Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Units, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Units through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the such Units. (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Units, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Units, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel (in addition to any applicable local counsel). (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation (except as set forth below). Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the 17
indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Units on the other from the offering of the Designated Units to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Units on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by PRO RATA allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Units underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged 18
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Units in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Units and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Units or Optional Units which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Units, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties satisfactory to the Company to purchase such Units on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Units on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Units, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Units, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Units for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Units. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Units which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Units and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 19
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Units or the option to purchase additional Units relating to such Optional Units, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Units. 11. If any Pricing Agreement or option to purchase additional Units shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Units or Optional Units with respect to which such Pricing Agreement shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 6, 8 and 19 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Designated Units are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Units, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Units except as provided in Sections 6, 8 and 19 hereof. 12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Units shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its principal address, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon written request.

13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Units from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. The Company irrevocably (i) agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding against the Company brought by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter arising out of or based upon this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and (iii) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. The Company has appointed CT Corporation System, New York, New York, as its authorized agent (the "Authorized Agent") upon whom process may be served in any such action arising out of or based on this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby which may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter, expressly consents to the jurisdiction of any such court in respect of any such action, and waives any other requirements of or objections to personal jurisdiction with respect thereto. Such appointment shall be irrevocable. The Company represents and warrants that the Authorized Agent has agreed to act as such agent for service of process and agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents and instruments, that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect as aforesaid. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent and written notice of such service to the Company shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon the Company. 15. Time shall be of the essence in each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 16. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 18. The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. 19. In respect of any judgment or order given or made for any amount due hereunder or under any Pricing Agreement that is expressed and paid in a currency (the "judgment currency") other 21
than United States dollars, the Company will indemnify each Underwriter against any loss incurred by such Underwriter as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the United States dollar amount is converted into the judgment currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and (ii) the rate of exchange at which an Underwriter is able to purchase United States dollars with the amount of judgment currency actually received by such Underwriter. The foregoing indemnity shall constitute a separate and independent obligation of the Company and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order aforesaid. The term "rate of exchange" shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into United States dollars.

Except as provided in the following sentence, the amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly or semi-annual period, as applicable, for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in such a 90-day or 180-day period, as applicable. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such 4
Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. SECTION 2.4. LIMIT ON AMOUNT OF NOTES. The Notes will be limited in aggregate principal amount to $825,000,000 and may, upon execution of this First Supplemental Indenture, be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Notes in accordance with a Company Order. SECTION 2.5. NATURE OF NOTES/MINIMUM DENOMINATION (a) The Notes shall constitute senior, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and shall rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company from time to time outstanding. (b) The Notes shall be issuable only in registered form and without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiples thereof except that an interest in a Note held as part of a Normal Unit represents an ownership interest of 1/40th, or 2.5%, of a Note in aggregate principal amount of $1,000 and will therefore correspond to the stated amount of $25 per Normal Unit. SECTION 2.6. NO SINKING FUND. The Notes do not have the benefit of any sinking fund obligation and, subject to Section 2.21 hereof are not redeemable at the option of the Holders. SECTION 2.7. ISSUANCE OF NOTES AND PAYMENT. (a) The Notes, on original issuance, shall be issued in the form of (i) one or more definitive, fully registered Notes registered initially in the name of U.S. Bank National Association, as Purchase Contract Agent and (ii) with respect to any Notes that are no longer a component of Normal Units and released from the lien of the Pledge Agreement, one fully registered Global Note registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), as Depositary, or its nominee, and deposited with the Trustee, as custodian for DTC, for credit by DTC to the respective accounts of beneficial owners of the Separate Notes represented thereby (or such other accounts as they may direct). (b) The principal of and the interest on the Notes will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to the account maintained in the United States designated by written notice given ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date by such Person. SECTION 2.8. NOTES NOT CONVERTIBLE OR EXCHANGEABLE. The Notes will not be convertible or exchangeable for other securities or property. 5
SECTION 2.9. GLOBAL NOTE. (a) DTC shall serve as the initial Depositary for the Global Note. (b) Unless and until it is exchanged for definitive Notes in accordance with the terms of the Base Indenture, a Global Note may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary, or to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary. SECTION 2.10. DEFEASANCE. The defeasance provisions of Sections 4.03 and 4.04 of the Base Indenture shall not apply to the Notes. SECTION 2.11. REDEMPTION. Pursuant to Section 301(6) and Section 1101 of the Base Indenture, so long as any of the Notes are Outstanding, the following provisions shall be applicable to the Notes: (a) If certain events specified in EXHIBIT A attached hereto shall occur and be continuing, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes then Outstanding in whole (but not in part) at any time at the Redemption Price and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in EXHIBIT A. (b) Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Indenture, notice of redemption shall (i) be sufficient if instead of setting forth a specific price with respect to the Redemption Price, it sets forth the manner of calculation thereof and (ii) shall be mailed to the Holders not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. SECTION 2.12. LISTING. In the event that the Notes become separately traded from the Normal Units to the extent that applicable exchange listing requirements are met, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Notes to be listed on the securities exchange on which the Normal Units are then listed. SECTION 2.13. REMARKETING. The Notes may be remarketed at a specified price on certain dates, all as specified in EXHIBIT A and Section 2.19 of this First Supplemental Indenture, in Section 5.4(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement and in Section 4.5(d) of the Pledge Agreement and the remarketing procedures set forth in such sections shall apply to the Notes. SECTION 2.14. GUARANTEES. The Notes will not be guaranteed by any third party. SECTION 2.15. PLACE OF PAYMENT. 6
The Paying Agent for the Notes shall initially be the Trustee, and the Place of Payment for the Notes shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office, which as of the date hereof for such purpose is located at 225 Asylum Street, 23rd Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103. The Company may from time to time designate one or more additional offices or agencies where Notes may be presented or surrendered for payment. SECTION 2.16. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The following shall constitute additional Events of Default pursuant to Section 501 of the Base Indenture with respect to the Notes with the same effect as if expressly set forth in such Section 501: (a) default by the Company under any instrument or instruments under which there is or may be secured or evidenced any of the Company's indebtedness (other than the Notes) having an outstanding principal amount of $50,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies) or more, individually or in the aggregate, that has caused the holders thereof to declare such indebtedness to be due and payable prior to its stated maturity, unless such declaration has been rescinded within 30 days; (b) default by the Company in the payment when due of the principal or premium, if any, of any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of the Company's indebtedness, in each case for money borrowed, or in the payment of principal or premium, if any, under any mortgage, indenture, agreement or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any indebtedness of the Company for money borrowed, which default for payment of principal or premium, if any, is in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $50,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies), if such default shall continue unremedied or unwaived for more than 30 days after the expiration of any grace period or extension of the time for payment applicable thereto; (c) default in the payment of any Additional Amounts payable with respect to interest on any Notes, when such Additional Amounts become due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; (d) default in the payment of any Additional Amounts payable with respect to any principal of or premium, if any, on any Notes, when such Additional Amounts become due and payable either at maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration of acceleration or otherwise; and (e) default in the payment of the Put Price on the Notes following the exercise of the Put Right by any Holder of Notes on the date that such payment is due and payable. In addition, with respect to the Notes, the reference to "60 days" in Section 501(1) of the Base Indenture shall be amended to be "30 days" with respect to the Notes. 7
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any Event of Default or any event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default. SECTION 2.17. COVENANTS. The Notes shall be entitled to the benefit of each of the covenants in Article Ten of the Base Indenture and the following additional covenants (which shall be deemed to be a provision of the Indenture and, when referred to as a provision of the Indenture, shall be identified by reference to the Section number that is set forth immediately preceding the covenant): SECTION 1008. LIMITATION ON LIENS ON STOCK OF DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARIES. The Company covenants that, so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will not, nor will the company permit any Designated Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur, guarantee or otherwise permit to exist any indebtedness evidenced by notes, debentures, bonds or similar instruments, which is secured by any mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest or other encumberance upon any shares of Capital Stock of the Company or any Designated Subsidiary (whether such shares of stock are now owned or hereafter acquired) without effectively providing concurrently that the Notes will be secured equally and ratably with such indebtedness for at least the time period such other indebtedness is so secured. "DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARY" means any present or future consolidated subsidiary of the Company that is a regulated insurance company, the assets of which constitute at least 20% of the Company's consolidated assets. SECTION 1009. ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS. All amounts payable (whether in respect of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of the Notes will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Cayman Islands or Bermuda or any political subdivision thereof or any authority or agency therein or thereof having power to tax, unless the withholding or deduction of such taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges is required by law. In that event, the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts receivable by a Holder after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction on such payment of additional amounts) shall equal the respective amounts that would have been receivable by such Holder had no such withholding or deduction been required ("ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS"), except that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable in relation to any payment in respect of any of the Notes (a) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Person who would be able to avoid such withholding or deduction by complying with such Person's statutory requirements or by making a declaration of non-residence or similar claim for exemption but, in either case, fails to do so, or is liable for such taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges in 8
respect of such Note by reason of his having some connection with (including, without limitation, being a citizen of, being incorporated or engaged in a trade or business in, or having a residence or principal place of business or other presence in) the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, as the case may be, other than (i) the mere holding of such Note or (ii) the receipt of principal, interest, or other amount in respect of such Note; (b) presented for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date, except to the extent that the relevant Holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting the same for payment on or before the expiry of such period of 30 days; (c) on account of any inheritance, gift, estate, personal property, sales or transfer or similar taxes, duties, levies, assessments or similar governmental charges; or (d) on account of any taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges that are payable otherwise than by withholding from payments in respect of such Note. If the Company becomes subject generally at any time to any taxing jurisdiction other than or in addition to the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, references in this section to the Cayman Islands and Bermuda shall be read and construed as references to such other jurisdiction(s) and/or to the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Any reference in the Indenture to principal, premium or interest in respect of the Notes, any redemption amount and any other amounts in the nature of principal, shall be deemed also to refer to any Additional Amounts that may be payable under the Indenture, and the express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provision hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to the Indenture, if the Notes require the payment of Additional Amounts, at least 30 days prior to each date on which any payments under or with respect to the Notes are due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter) the Company, or its designee shall furnish to the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent an Officers' Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable, and any other information to enable the Trustee or such Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the payment date. The Company will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of any Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes), or the receipt of any payments with respect to the Notes, excluding any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands or Bermuda in which a Paying Agent is located, other than those 9
resulting from, or required to be paid in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, the Indenture or any other such document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes. SECTION 2.18. NON-APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN SECTIONS. Sections 1108, 1109 and 1110 of the Base Indenture shall not apply to the Notes. SECTION 2.19. REMARKETING. (a) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred, the Company shall engage, no later than 30 days prior to the Remarketing Date, a nationally recognized investment bank (the "REMARKETING AGENT") pursuant to a Remarketing Agreement to be entered into between the Company and the Remarketing Agent, but providing for remarketing procedures substantially as set forth below, to sell the Notes of Holders of Normal Units, other than Holders that have elected not to participate in the remarketing pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) below, and Holders of Separate Notes that have elected to participate in the remarketing pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.20 below and in Section 4.5(d) of the Pledge Agreement. (b) The Pledged Notes comprising part of Normal Units and the Separate Notes of Holders of Separate Notes that have elected to participate in the Remarketing shall be remarketed by the Remarketing Agent on the Remarketing Date, and, if necessary, on each Subsequent Remarketing Date. A Holder of Normal Units may elect not to participate in a Remarketing and retain the Notes underlying such Normal Units by notifying the Purchase Contract Agent of such election and delivering the Purchase Price to the Collateral Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, which such amount will be paid to the Company on the Stock Purchase Date in settlement of such Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contracts. A Holder of Normal Units that has not settled the related Purchase Contract through a Cash Settlement or an Early Settlement pursuant to Sections 5.4(a) and 5.9 of the Purchase Contract Agreement or by electing not to participate in the Remarketing pursuant to this paragraph (b) and Section 5.4(b)(iv) of the Purchase Contract Agreement shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the Remarketing. (c) No later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the seventh Business Day preceding the Remarketing Date, the Company, or the Purchase Contract Agent, at the Company's request, shall deliver the Remarketing Notice to Holders of Normal Units and Holders of Separate Notes, of the Remarketing to take place on the Remarketing Date, and, if necessary, on each Subsequent Remarketing Date. The Remarketing Notice will include the amount of cash that must be delivered by Holders of Normal Units that elect not to participate in the remarketing and the deadline for such delivery, as well as information with respect to the exercise of the Put Right. If such Normal Units or Separate Notes are held in global form, the Company, or the Purchase Contract Agent, at the Company's request, will cause the Clearing Agency to notify the Clearing Agency Participants of the Remarketing by no later than the seventh Business Day preceding the Remarketing Date. 10
(d) The Purchase Contract Agent shall notify, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the eleventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the Remarketing Agent and the Collateral Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of Normal Units Holders to be remarketed. On the the eleventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, no later than by 10:00 a.m. New York City time, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Custodial Agent will notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Notes to be remarketed. No later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the tenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will deliver for Remarketing to the Remarketing Agent all Notes to be remarketed. (e) The right of each Holder of Notes to have its Notes tendered for purchase will be limited to the extent that (i) the Remarketing Agent conducts a Remarketing pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) the Notes included in the Remarketing have not been called for redemption upon the occurrence of a Special Event; (iii) the Remarketing Agent is able to find a purchaser or purchasers for the remarketed Notes at a Reset Rate such that the aggregate value of such remarketed Notes is equal to 100.25% of the Remarketing Value and (iv) such purchaser or purchasers deliver the purchase price therefor to the Remarketing Agent. (f) Upon receipt of the notice provided above in paragraph (d) from the Purchase Contract Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Notes from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Remarketing Date, and, if necessary, on each Subsequent Remarketing Date, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) establish a rate of interest that, in the opinion of the Remarketing Agent, will, when applied to the outstanding Notes, enable the then current aggregate market value of the Notes to have a value equal to 100.25% of the Remarketing Value as of the Remarketing Date or as of any Subsequent Remarketing Date, as the case may be (the "RESET RATE") and (ii) sell such Notes on suchdate at a price equal to 100.25% of the Remarketing Value. (g) If, in spite of using its reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on the Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent will attempt to establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on each Subsequent Remarketing Date, if necessary. If, in spite of using its reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent fails to remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on or before 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the remarketing will be deemed to have failed (the "LAST FAILED REMARKETING"). (h) On the Remarketing Date and any Subsequent Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall advise the Company, by telephone, of any successful or unsuccessful Remarketing as soon as practicable after such determination. 11
(i) If a successful Remarketing shall have occurred, the Remarketing Agent will, on or prior to the third Business Day following the date on which the Notes were successfully remarketed, in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement: (i) deduct and retain for itself the Remarketing Fee; (ii) pay the proceeds from such successful Remarketing related to the Notes of Holders of Normal Units that were remarketed to the Collateral Agent, which, for the benefit of the Company, will thereupon apply such proceeds, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement in direct settlement of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts; (iii) if any Separate Notes were remarketed, remit to the Custodial Agent for payment to the Holders of such Separate Notes sold in the Remarketing the remaining proceeds from such successful Remarketing attributable to the Separate Notes; and (iv) if there remain any proceeds from such successful Remarketing, after the application of such proceeds as set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this sentence, then remit such remaining proceeds to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Normal Units that were remarketed, all determined on a pro rata basis. (j) If a successful Remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent shall, as soon as practicable on the Remarketing Date or on the Subsequent Remarketing Date, as the case may be, in the case of the Company, and by approximately 4:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the Trading Day following the Remarketing Date, or the Subsequent Remarketing Date, as the case may be, advise, by telephone: (i) the Depositary and the Company of the Reset Rate determined in the Remarketing and the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold in the Remarketing; (ii) each purchaser (or the Depository Participant thereof) of the Reset Rate and the aggregate principal amount of remarketed Notes such purchaser is to purchase; and (iii) each purchaser to give instructions to its Depository Participant to pay the purchase price on the date of settlement for such Remarketing in same day funds against delivery of the remarketed Notes purchased through the facilities of DTC. (k) Any distribution to Holders of excess funds and interest described in this Section 2.19 shall be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, or, if the Units do not remain in book-entry only form, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to the account 12
maintained in the United States designated by written notice given ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date by such Person. (l) If a failed remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent and the Company, as applicable, shall take the following actions: (i) the Remarketing Agent shall notify by telephone the Company and the Depositary that a failed remarketing has occurred; (ii) The Company will cause a notice of failed remarketing to be published by 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following such failed remarketing; and (iii) The Company will release this information by means of Bloomberg and Reuters (or any successor or equivalent newswires) newswires. (m) The Remarketing Agent shall remit, within three Business Days following the Last Failed Remarketing, the Pledged Notes that were to be remarketed to the Collateral Agent and the Separate Notes that were to be remarketed to the Custodial Agent. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, may exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Notes, including those actions specified in Section 2.19(n) below; provided that, if upon the Last Failed Remarketing the Collateral Agent exercises such rights for the benefit of the Company with respect to such Notes, any accumulated and unpaid interest on such Notes will become payable by the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the Normal Units to which such Notes relate. Such payment will be made by the Company on or prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Stock Purchase Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashier's check or wire transfer in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Purchase Contract Agent. (n) With respect to any Notes which constitute part of Normal Units which are subject to the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company reserves all of its rights as a secured party with respect thereto and, subject to applicable law and Section 5.4(e) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, may, among other things permit the Company to, (A) retain and cancel such Notes or (B) cause the Notes to be sold, in either case, in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts. (o) In the event of a Last Failed Remarketing, the interest rate payable on the Notes will not be reset. (p) In accordance with DTC's normal procedures, on the date of settlement of such Remarketing, the transactions described above with respect to each Note remarketed in the Remarketing shall be executed through DTC, and the accounts of the respective Depository Participants shall be debited and credited and such remarketed Notes delivered by book-entry as necessary to effect purchases and sales of such remarketed Notes. DTC shall make payment in accordance with its normal procedures. 13
(q) The Remarketing Agent is not obligated to purchase any Notes that otherwise would remain unsold in the Remarketing. Neither the Company nor the Remarketing Agent shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment upon tender of the Notes for Remarketing. (r) Under the Remarketing Agreement, the Company, in its capacity as issuer of the Notes, shall be liable for, and shall pay, any and all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Remarketing, other than the Remarketing Fee. (s) The settlement procedures set forth herein, including provisions for payment by purchasers of the remarketed Notes in the Remarketing, shall be subject to modification to the extent required by DTC or if the book-entry system is no longer available for the remarketed Notes at the time of the Remarketing, to facilitate the Remarketing of the remarketed Notes in certificated form, and shall provide for the authentication and delivery of Notes in a principal amount equal to the unremarketed portion of such Notes. In addition, the Remarketing Agent may modify the settlement procedures set forth herein in order to facilitate the settlement process. SECTION 2.20. OPTIONAL REMARKETING. (a) On or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date but no earlier than the sixteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, Holders of Separate Notes may elect to have their Separate Notes remarketed by delivering their Separate Notes, together with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit C to the Pledge Agreement, to the Custodial Agent. On the eleventh Business Day immediately prior to the Stock Purchase Date, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of such Separate Notes to be remarketed. The Custodial Agent will hold such Separate Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account. A Holder of Separate Notes electing to have its Separate Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw such election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D to the Pledge Agreement, on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent will return such Separate Notes to such Holder. (b) On the tenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the Custodial Agent at the written direction of the Remarketing Agent will deliver to the Remarketing Agent for Remarketing all Separate Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to Section 4.5(d) of the Pledge Agreement and not withdrawn pursuant to the terms thereof prior to such date. If the Holder of the Separate Notes delivers only such notice but not the Separate Notes subject to such notice, then none of such Holder's Separate Notes shall be included in the Remarketing. Once the Holder of Separate Notes elects to participate in the Remarketing, such Separate Notes will be remarketed in the Remarketing, unless such notice is properly withdrawn. In accordance with Section 4.5(d) of the Pledge Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Last Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will promptly return such Separate Notes to the Custodial Agent for redelivery to such Holders of such Separate Notes. 14
SECTION 2.21. PUT RIGHT. Any Remarking Notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.19(c) hereof shall include information relating to the Put Right provided for in this Section 2.21. In the case of the Last Failed Remarketing, the Holders of Notes that remain outstanding and that are not Pledged Notes (as defined in the Pledge Agreement) will have the right to put on June 14, 2007 (the "Put Right") their Notes to the Company for an amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to June 14, 2007 (the "Put Price"), by providing notice to the Company on or prior to the date set forth in the Remarketing Notice and by following the procedures for delivery of such Notes to be set forth therein. The Put Price shall be due and payable by the Company upon receipt of the Notes from the Holders that have exercised their Put Right, on June 14, 2007. ARTICLE III APPOINTMENT OF THE TRUSTEE FOR THE NOTES SECTION 3.1. APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE. Pursuant and subject to the Indenture, the Company and the Trustee hereby constitute the Trustee as trustee to act on behalf of the Holders of the Notes, and as the principal Paying Agent and Security Registrar for the Notes, effective upon execution and delivery of this First Supplemental Indenture. By execution, acknowledgment and delivery of this First Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee hereby accepts appointment as trustee, Paying Agent and Security Registrar with respect to the Notes, and agrees to perform such trusts upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture and in this First Supplemental Indenture. SECTION 3.2. RIGHTS, POWERS, DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE TRUSTEE. Any rights, powers, duties and obligations by any provisions of the Indenture conferred or imposed upon the Trustee shall, insofar as permitted by law, be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Trustee with respect to the Notes. ARTICLE IV MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 4.1. APPLICATION OF FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE. Each and every term and condition contained in the First Supplemental Indenture that modifies, amends or supplements the terms and conditions of the Base Indenture shall apply only to the Notes created hereby and not to any future series of Securities issued under the Base Indenture. SECTION 4.2. BENEFITS OF FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE. Nothing contained in this First Supplemental Indenture shall or shall be construed to confer upon any person other than a Holder of the Notes, the Company and the Trustee any 15
right or interest to avail itself or himself, as the case may be, of any benefit under any provision of the Base Indenture or this First Supplemental Indenture. SECTION 4.3. AMENDMENT OF FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE. The Company and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may amend, modify or supplement this First Supplemental Indenture in accordance with the provisions of Article Nine of the Base Indenture. SECTION 4.4. EFFECTIVE DATE. This First Supplemental Indenture shall be effective as of the date first above written and upon the execution and delivery hereof by each of the parties hereto. SECTION 4.5. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; JUDGMENT CURRENCY. THIS FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE AND EACH NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. The Company and the Trustee hereby submit to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City for the purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to the Indenture. The Company and the Trustee irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Company hereby designates and appoints CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011 as its authorized agent upon which process may be served in any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Indenture which may be instituted in any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, and agrees that service of process upon such agent, and written notice of said service to the Company by the Person serving the same, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Company in any such suit, action or proceeding and further designates its domicile, the domicile of CT Corporation System specified above and any domicile CT Corporation System may have in the future as its domicile to receive any notice hereunder (including service of process). If for any reason CT Corporation System (or any successor agent for this purpose) shall cease to act as agent for service of process as provided above, the Company will promptly appoint a successor agent for this purpose reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. The Company agrees to take any and all actions as may be necessary to maintain such designation and appointment of such agent in full force and effect. The Company agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that (a) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due (the "REQUIRED CURRENCY") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "JUDGMENT CURRENCY"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New 16
York the requisite amount of the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the New York Banking Day preceding the day on which a final unappealable judgment is given and (b) its obligations under the Indenture to make payments in the Required Currency (i) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with clause (a)), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments, (ii) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable and (iii) shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sum due under the Indenture. For purpose of the foregoing, "NEW YORK BANKING DAY" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to be closed. SECTION 4.6. TAX TREATMENT.

In the event the Notes are successfully remarketed pursuant to the Indenture, the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement, this Note shall bear interest at the Reset Rate, from and including the Reset Date to the date on which principal hereof is paid or made available for payment; provided that any principal and installment of interest which is overdue shall bear interest (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) at the Initial Interest Rate up to but excluding the Reset Date, if any, and thereafter at the Reset Rate, from the dates such amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment, and such interest shall be payable on demand. Interest on this Note initially shall be payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year (each, an "INTEREST PAYMENT DATE"), commencing May 15, 2004 through and including May 15, 2007, and then semi-annually in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates of May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2007, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be, the 15th calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 A-2
days prior to such Special Record Date and shall otherwise be payable, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. The principal of and the interest on the Notes will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to the account maintained in the United States designated by written notice given ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date by such Person. The amount of interest payable for any period on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Except as provided in the following sentence, the amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly or semi-annual period, as applicable, for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in such a 90-day or 180-day period, as applicable. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if fully set forth at this place.

CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee By: --------------------------------------- Authorized Officer A-5
[FORM OF REVERSE] This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company designated as its "2.53% Senior Notes due 2009" (herein sometimes referred to as the "NOTES"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $825,000,000, issued and to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of January 23, 2003 (the "BASE INDENTURE"), duly executed and delivered between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "TRUSTEE"), and a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 23, 2004 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee (such Base Indenture as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, the "INDENTURE"), to which Indenture and all subsequent indentures supplemental thereto relating to the Notes reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof except that an interest in a Note held as part of a Normal Unit represents an ownership interest of 1/40th, or 2.5%, of a Note in aggregate principal amount of $1,000 and will therefore correspond to the stated amount of $25 per Normal Unit. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series so issued are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. The Notes were initially issued as components of the Company's 6.50% Equity Security Units that are in the form of Normal Units, each such Normal Unit initially consisting of (a) a stock purchase contract (each, a "PURCHASE CONTRACT") under which (i) the Holder will agree to purchase from the Company on May 15, 2007, a specified number of newly issued Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company and (ii) the Company will pay to the Holder quarterly contract adjustment payments and (b) a 1/40, or 2.5%, ownership interest in a Note of $1,000 principal amount. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, on their initial issuance, the Notes were pledged by the Purchase Contract Agent, on behalf of the Holders of the Normal Units, to U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary (the "COLLATERAL AGENT"), pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2004 (the "PLEDGE AGREEMENT"), among the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent, to secure such Holders' obligations to purchase Class A Ordinary Shares of the Company under the Purchase Contracts. The Notes that are a component of Normal Units or that so elect under Section 2.20 of the Supplemental Indenture will be subject to Remarketing and, in the case of the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company reserves all of its rights as a secured party of the Pledged Notes with respect thereto and, subject to applicable law and Section 5.4 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, may, among other things, permit the Company to cause the Notes to be sold or to retain and cancel such Notes, in either case, in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts. Pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent shall use its reasonable best efforts to remarket the Notes that are included in Normal Units and the Separate Notes included pursuant to Section 2.20 of the First Supplemental Indenture at a specified price on certain dates, all as specified in A-6
Section 2.19 of the First Supplemental Indenture and in Section 5.4(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement. If a Special Event (as herein defined) shall occur and be continuing, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes then Outstanding in whole (but not in part) at any time ("SPECIAL EVENT REDEMPTION") at the Redemption Price (as herein defined). If such Special Event Redemption occurs prior to the earlier of a successful remarketing pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Purchase Contract Agreement and May 15, 2007, the Redemption Price payable with respect to the Notes pledged to the Collateral Agent under the Pledge Agreement will be paid to the Collateral Agent on the Special Event Redemption Date on or prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and at such account as may be designated by the Collateral Agent in exchange for the Notes pledged to the Collateral Agent. In such event, the Collateral Agent shall apply such Redemption Price pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Notice of any redemption (which notice will be irrevocable) will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the date of redemption (the "SPECIAL EVENT REDEMPTION DATE") to each registered Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address as more fully provided in the Indenture. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Special Event Redemption Date interest shall cease to accrue on such Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case of a Special Event Redemption for a Tax Event, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the payor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of Notes by it were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Paying Agent (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that any factual conditions precedent to the Company's right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) a legal opinion of an outside nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that the circumstances referred to below in "Tax Event" exist. "QUOTATION AGENT" means Goldman, Sachs & Co. or any of its successors or any other primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City selected by the Company. "ACCOUNTING EVENT REDEMPTION" means the receipt, at any time prior to the earlier of the date of any successful remarketing of the Notes pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement and the Stock Purchase Date, by the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company or a written report in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards ("SAS") No. 97, "Amendment to SAS No. 50--Reports on the Application of Accounting Principles," from the Company's independent auditors, provided at the request of management of the Company, to the effect that, as a result of any change in accounting rules applicable to the Company or interpretations thereof after March 17, 2004, the Company must either (i) account for the Purchase Contracts as derivatives under SFAS 133 (or any successor accounting standard) or (ii) account for the Units using the if-converted method under SFAS 128 (or any successor accounting standard), and that such accounting treatment will cease to apply upon redemption of the Notes. A-7
"REDEMPTION PRICE" means, for each Note, whether or not included in a Normal Unit, the greater of (a) the principal amount of the Note and (b) the product of (i) the principal amount of such Note and (ii) a fraction whose numerator is the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price (as herein defined) and whose denominator is the applicable Special Event Redemption Principal Amount (as herein defined). "SPECIAL EVENT" means either an Accounting Redemption Event or a Tax Event. "TAX EVENT" means a determination by the Company that, as a result (1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the Cayman Islands, Bermuda or any other jurisdiction in which the Company generally becomes subject to taxation; or (2) any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a "CHANGE IN TAX LAW"), the Company is, or on the next Interest Payment Date would be, required to pay more than DE MINIMIS Additional Amounts (as defined in Section 1009 of the Indenture) and such obligations cannot be avoided by taking commercially reasonable measures available to the Company. The Change in Tax Law must become effective after March 17, 2004. In the case of a successor entity, the Change in Tax Law must become effective after the date that such successor entity first becomes an obligor on the Notes (unless the Change in Tax Law had already occurred prior to such date, but occurring after March 17, 2004, with respect to the original entity). "SPECIAL EVENT REDEMPTION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT" means (i) in the case of a Special Event Redemption Date occurring prior to a successful remarketing of the Notes pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement, the aggregate principal amount of Notes included in Normal Units on such date, and (ii) in the case of a Special Event Redemption Date occurring after a successful remarketing of the Notes pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement or the Stock Purchase Date, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. "TREASURY PORTFOLIO" means: (i) if a Special Event Redemption occurs prior to a successful remarketing of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, a portfolio (A) of zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities consisting of principal or interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities that mature on or prior to May 15, 2007 in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable Special Event Redemption Principal Amount and (B) with respect to each scheduled Interest Payment Date on the Notes that occurs after the Special Event Redemption Date and on or before May 15, 2007, interest or principal strips of U.S. Treasury securities that mature on or prior to such Interest Payment Date in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate interest payment that would be due on the applicable Special Event Redemption Principal Amount on such date if the interest rate of the Notes were not reset on the Reset Date, and (ii) solely for purposes of determining the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price in the case of a Special Event Redemption Date occurring after a successful remarketing of the Notes pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement or May 15, 2007, a portfolio (A) of zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities consisting of principal or interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities that mature on or prior to May 15, 2009 in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable Special Event Redemption Principal Amount and (B) with respect to each scheduled Interest Payment Date on the Notes that occurs after the Special Event Redemption Date and on or before May 15, 2009, interest or A-8
principal strips of U.S. Treasury securities that mature on or prior to such Interest Payment Date in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate interest payment that would be due on the applicable Special Event Redemption Principal Amount of the Notes Outstanding on the Special Event Redemption Date. "TREASURY PORTFOLIO PURCHASE PRICE" means the lowest aggregate price quoted by a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City to the Quotation Agent on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Special Event Redemption Date for the purchase of the Treasury Portfolio for settlement on the Special Event Redemption Date. The Notes shall constitute the senior, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and shall rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company. In the event of the Last Failed Remarketing, any Holder of Notes that remain outstanding on May 15, 2007 and that are not subject to the pledge of the Pledge Agreement, shall have the benefit of the Put Right set forth in Section 2.21 of the First Supplemental Indenture. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. In the event of a redemption of the Notes, the Company will not be required (a) to register the transfer or exchange of Notes for a period of 15 days immediately preceding the selection of Notes for redemption or (b) to register the transfer or exchange of any Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption. In the case of an Event of Default described in Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture, all unpaid principal of and accrued interest and Additional Amounts on the Notes then Outstanding shall be due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders of any Notes. In the case all other Events of Default, if such Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all of the Notes, together with accrued interest to the date of declaration, may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains, with certain exceptions as therein provided, provisions permitting Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note. A-9
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding shall have made a written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it, (iii) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and (iv) the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by any Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof, or any premium of interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to recover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

No recourse for the payment of the principal (and premium, if any) or interest on this Note and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, employee, agent, officer or director or subsidiary, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the A-10
enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released. The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in the Notes, each beneficial Holder of Notes will be deemed to have agreed (1) to treat the acquisition of a Normal Unit as the acquisition of the Note and the Purchase Contract constituting the Normal Unit and to allocate the purchase price of the Normal Unit between the Note and the Purchase Contract as $25 and $0, respectively and (2) to treat the Notes as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes.

Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Agreement, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument. SECTION 1.4. ACTS OF HOLDERS; RECORD DATES. (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement and (subject to Section 7.1) conclusive in favor of the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any manner which the Purchase Contract Agent deems sufficient. (c) The ownership of Units shall be proved by the Normal Units Register or the Stripped Units Register, as the case may be. (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Certificate shall bind every future Holder of the same Certificate and the Holder of every Certificate issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Certificate. (e) The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Units entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders of Units. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of the Outstanding Normal Units and the Outstanding Stripped Units, as the case may be, on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to
15 take the relevant action with respect to the Normal Units or the Stripped Units, as the case may be, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; PROVIDED that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite number of Outstanding Units on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite number of Outstanding Units on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Purchase Contract Agent in writing and to each Holder of Units in the manner set forth in Section 1.6. (f) With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the Company may designate any date as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; PROVIDED that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the Purchase Contract Agent in writing, and to each Holder of Units in the manner set forth in Section 1.6, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the Company shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date. SECTION 1.5. NOTICES. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Agreement to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with: (a) the Purchase Contract Agent by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or filed in writing and personally delivered, mailed, first-class postage prepaid, telecopied or delivered by overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, addressed to and received by the Purchase Contract Agent at 225 Asylum Street, 23rd Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103, Attention: Arthur L. Blakeslee, telecopy: (503) 258-5977, or at any other address furnished in writing by the Purchase Contract Agent to the Holders and the Company; or (b) the Company by the Purchase Contract Agent or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or filed in writing and personally delivered, mailed, first-class postage prepaid, telecopied or delivered by overnight air courier guaranteeing at least second day delivery, addressed to and received by the Company at XL Capital Ltd, XL House, One Bermudiana Road, Hamilton HM11, Bermuda Attention: Paul S. Giordano, telecopy: (441) 292-5280, or at any other address furnished in writing to the Purchase Contract Agent by the Company; or (c) the Collateral Agent by the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company or any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly
16 provided) if made, given, furnished or filed in writing and personally delivered, mailed, first-class postage prepaid, telecopied or delivered by overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, addressed to and received by the Collateral Agent at 225 Asylum Street, 23rd Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103, Attention: Elizabeth Hammer, telecopy: (860) 241-6897, or at any other address furnished in writing by the Collateral Agent to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company and the Holders; or (d) the Trustee by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or filed in writing and personally delivered, mailed, first-class postage prepaid, telecopied or delivered by overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, addressed to and received by the Trustee at 225 Asylum Street, 23rd Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103, Attention: Arthur L. Blakeslee, telecopy: (503) 258-5927, or at any other address furnished in writing by the Trustee to the Company. SECTION 1.6. NOTICE TO HOLDERS; WAIVER. (a) Where this Agreement provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at its address as it appears in the applicable Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Purchase Contract Agent, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. (b) In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Purchase Contract Agent shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. SECTION 1.7. EFFECT OF HEADINGS AND TABLE OF CONTENTS. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 1.8. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All covenants and agreements in this Agreement by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. SECTION 1.9. SEPARABILITY CLAUSE. If any provision hereof is invalid and unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the intentions of the parties hereto as nearly as may be possible and (ii) the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
17 SECTION 1.10. BENEFITS OF AGREEMENT. Nothing in this Agreement or in the Units, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and, to the extent provided hereby, the Holders, any benefits or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement. The Holders from time to time shall be beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions hereof and of the Units evidenced by their Certificates by their acceptance of delivery of such Certificates. SECTION 1.11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE UNITS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT UNDER, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. The Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders from time to time of the Units, acting through the Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact, hereby submit to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City for the purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders from time to time of the Units, acting through the Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact, irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Company hereby designates and appoints CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011 as its authorized agent upon which process may be served in any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement which may be instituted in any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, and agrees that service of process upon such agent, and written notice of said service to the Company by the Person serving the same, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Company in any such suit, action or proceeding and further designates its domicile, the domicile of CT Corporation System specified above and any domicile CT Corporation System may have in the future as its domicile to receive any notice hereunder (including service of process). If for any reason CT Corporation System (or any successor agent for this purpose) shall cease to act as agent for service of process as provided above, the Company will promptly appoint a successor agent for this purpose reasonably acceptable to the Purchase Contract Agent. The Company agrees to take any and all actions as may be necessary to maintain such designation and appointment of such agent in full force and effect. SECTION 1.12. JUDGMENT CURRENCY. The Company agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that (a) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Purchase Contract Agent could purchase in The City of New York the requisite amount of the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the New York Banking Day preceding the day on which a final unappealable judgment is given and (b) its obligations under this Agreement to make payments in the Required Currency (i) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with clause (a)), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be
18 payable in respect of such payments, (ii) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable and (iii) shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sum due under this Agreement. For purpose of the foregoing, "New York Banking Day" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to be closed. SECTION 1.13. LEGAL HOLIDAYS. (a) In any case where any Payment Date shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Normal Units Certificates) payments on the Units shall not be made on such date, but such payments shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Payment Date, PROVIDED that no interest shall accrue or be payable by the Company in respect of such payment for the period from and after any such Payment Date, except that if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Payment Date. (b) If any date on which Contract Adjustment Payments are to be made on the Purchase Contracts is not a Business Day, then payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, and no interest or additional payment will be paid in respect of the delay. However, if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, the payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on that Payment Date. (c) In any case where the Stock Purchase Date shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Certificates) the Purchase Contracts shall not be performed on such date, but the Purchase Contracts shall be performed on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if performed on the Stock Purchase Date. SECTION 1.14. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. SECTION 1.15. INSPECTION OF AGREEMENT. A copy of this Agreement shall be available at all reasonable times during normal business hours at the Corporate Trust Office for inspection by any Holder. SECTION 1.16. APPOINTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AS PURCHASE CONTRACT AGENT FOR THE COMPANY. The Company may appoint a financial institution (which may be the Collateral Agent) to act as its agent in performing its obligations and in accepting and enforcing performance of the obligations of the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders, under this Agreement and the Purchase Contracts, by giving notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 1.5 hereof. Any such appointment shall not relieve the Company in any way from its obligation hereunder.
19 SECTION 1.17. NO WAIVER. No failure on the part of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. ARTICLE II CERTIFICATE FORMS SECTION 2.1. FORMS OF CERTIFICATES GENERALLY.

SECTION 3.5. REGISTRATION; REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE. (a) The Purchase Contract Agent shall keep at the Corporate Trust Office a register (the register maintained in such office or in any other office or agency designated pursuant to Section 10.2 being herein referred to as "Normal Units Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Purchase Contract Agent shall provide for the registration of Normal Units Certificates and of transfers of Normal Units Certificates (the Purchase Contract Agent, in such capacity, the "Normal Units Registrar") and a register (the register maintained in such office or in any other office or agency designated pursuant to Section 10.2 being herein referred to as the "Stripped Units Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Purchase Contract Agent shall provide for the registration of the Stripped Units Certificates and of transfers of Stripped Units Certificates (the Purchase Contract Agent, in such capacity, the "Stripped Units Registrar").

(d) All Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate shall evidence the ownership of the same number of Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same obligations, under this Agreement as the Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. (e) Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent duly executed by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing.
24 (f) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges pursuant to Sections 3.6, 3.9 and 8.5 not involving any transfer. (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to issue or execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder and deliver, any Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange on or after the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the earlier of the Stock Purchase Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, (i) if the Stock Purchase Date has occurred, deliver the Ordinary Shares issuable in respect of the Purchase Contracts forming a part of the Units evidenced by such Certificate, (ii) in the case of Normal Units, if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Notes or the Treasury Consideration, as applicable, relating to such Normal Units, or (iii) in the case of Stripped Units, if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Treasury Securities relating to such Stripped Units, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article V. SECTION 3.6. BOOK-ENTRY INTERESTS. The Certificates, on original issuance, will be issued in the form of one or more fully registered Global Certificates, to be delivered to the Depositary or a nominee or custodian thereof by, or on behalf of, the Company. Such Global Certificate shall initially be registered on the books and records of the Company in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depositary, and no Beneficial Owner will receive a definitive Certificate representing such Beneficial Owner's interest in such Global Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.9. The Purchase Contract Agent shall enter into a customary agreement with the Depositary if so requested by the Company. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Certificates have been issued to Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 3.9: (a) the provisions of this Section 3.6 shall be in full force and effect; (b) the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Agreement (including the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, and receiving approvals, votes or consents hereunder) as the Holder of the Units and the sole holder of the Global Certificate(s) and shall have no obligation to the Beneficial Owners;
25 (c) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.6 conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement or any Certificate, the provisions of this Section 3.6 shall control; and (d) the rights of the Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Beneficial Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. The Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers among Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments of Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, to such Clearing Agency Participants. SECTION 3.7. NOTICES TO HOLDERS. Whenever a notice or other communication to the Holders is required to be given under this Agreement, the Company or the Company's agent shall give such notices and communications to the Holders and, with respect to any Units registered in the name of a Clearing Agency or the nominee of a Clearing Agency, the Company or the Company's agent shall, except as set forth herein, have no obligations to the Beneficial Owners. SECTION 3.8. APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR CLEARING AGENCY. If any Clearing Agency elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Units or ceases to be eligible as a "clearing agency" under the Exchange Act, the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor Clearing Agency with respect to the Units. SECTION 3.9. DEFINITIVE CERTIFICATES. If: (a) a Clearing Agency notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Units and a successor Clearing Agency is not appointed within 90 days after such discontinuance pursuant to Section 3.8, (b) the Company elects to terminate the book-entry system arrangements through the Clearing Agency with respect to the Units, or (c) there shall have occurred and be continuing a default by the Company in respect of its obligations under this Agreement or the Indenture governing the Notes, then, upon surrender of the Global Certificates representing the Book-Entry Interests with respect to the Units by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Company shall cause definitive Certificates to be delivered to Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. The Company shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. SECTION 3.10. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN CERTIFICATES. (a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate at the cost of the Holder,
26 evidencing the same number of Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. (b) If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) such security or indemnity at the cost of the Holder as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or to a Responsible Officer of the Purchase Contract Agent that such Certificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate, evidencing the same number of Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, a Certificate on or after the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the earlier of the Stock Purchase Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall: (i) if the Stock Purchase Date has occurred, deliver the Ordinary Shares issuable in respect of the Purchase Contracts forming a part of the Units evidenced by such Certificate, (ii) in the case of Normal Units, if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Notes or the Treasury Consideration, as applicable, relating to such Normal Units, or (iii) in the case of Stripped Units, if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Treasury Securities relating to such Stripped Units, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article V. (d) Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 3.10, the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Purchase Contract Agent) connected therewith. (e) Every new Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.10 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and of the Holder in respect of the Unit evidenced thereby, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate (and the Units evidenced thereby) shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits and be subject to all the
27 obligations of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Certificates delivered hereunder. (f) The provisions of this Section 3.10 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates. SECTION 3.11. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. (a) Prior to due presentment of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, may treat the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered on the Register as the owner of the Units evidenced thereby, for the purpose of receiving quarterly payments on the Notes or Treasury Consideration, receiving payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any such payments shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company nor the Purchase Contract Agent, nor any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Certificate, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, from treating the Clearing Agency as the sole Holder of such Global Certificate or from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any Clearing Agency (or its nominee), as a Holder of such Global Certificate, with respect to such Global Certificate or impair, as between such Clearing Agency and the Beneficial Owners, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of rights of such Clearing Agency (or its nominee) as a Holder of such Global Certificate. SECTION 3.12. CANCELLATION. (a) All Certificates surrendered (i) for delivery of Ordinary Shares on or after any Settlement Date; (ii) upon the transfer of Notes or Treasury Consideration or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, after the occurrence of a Termination Event or pursuant to an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, or a Collateral Substitution or an establishment or re-establishment of a Normal Unit; or (iii) upon the registration of a transfer or exchange of a Unit shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Purchase Contract Agent, be delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent and, if not already cancelled, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent for cancellation any Certificates previously authenticated, executed on behalf of any Holder and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Certificates so delivered shall, upon Issuer Order, be promptly cancelled by the Purchase Contract Agent. No Certificates shall be authenticated, executed on behalf of any Holder and delivered in lieu of or in exchange for any Certificates cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. All cancelled Certificates held by the Purchase Contract Agent shall be disposed of by the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with its then customary procedures.
28 (b) If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall acquire any Certificate, such acquisition shall not operate as a cancellation of such Certificate unless and until such Certificate is cancelled or delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent for cancellation. SECTION 3.13. ESTABLISHMENT OF STRIPPED UNITS. (a) A Holder may separate the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, as applicable, from the related Purchase Contracts in respect of the Normal Units held by such Holder by substituting for such Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, Treasury Securities that will pay at the Stock Purchase Date an amount equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of such Normal Units (a "Collateral Substitution"), at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, by (i) depositing with the Collateral Agent Treasury Securities having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of such Normal Units, and (ii) transferring the related Normal Units to the Purchase Contract Agent accompanied by a notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, with a copy of such of such notice to the Company, stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Treasury Securities to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Purchase Contract Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, underlying such Normal Units, whereupon the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, with a copy of such instruction to the Company, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Upon receipt of the Treasury Securities described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Purchase Contract Agent, on behalf of the Holder, such Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly: (x) cancel the related Normal Units Certificate; (y) transfer the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, to the Holder; and (z) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a Stripped Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 evidencing the same number of Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Normal Units. (b) Holders who elect to separate the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, from the related Purchase Contract and to substitute Treasury Securities for such Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent in respect of the substitution, and the Company shall not be responsible for any such fees or expenses. (c) Holders may make Collateral Substitutions (i) if Treasury Securities are being substituted for Pledged Notes, only in integral multiples of 40 Normal Units, or (ii) if the Collateral Substitutions occur after a Special Event Redemption, as the case may be, only in
29 integral multiples of Normal Units such that the Treasury Securities to be deposited and the Treasury Consideration to be released are in integral multiples of $1,000. (d) In the event a Holder making a Collateral Substitution pursuant to this Section 3.13 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the Normal Units or fails to deliver a Normal Units Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent after depositing Treasury Securities with the Collateral Agent, the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, constituting a part of such Normal Units, and any distributions on such Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration shall be held in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Normal Units are so transferred or the Normal Units Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, with respect to a Normal Units Certificate, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent that such Normal Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company. (e) Except as described in this Section 3.13, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Normal Unit remains in effect, such Normal Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Normal Unit in respect of the Pledged Note or the Pledged Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, and the Purchase Contract comprising such Normal Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Normal Unit. SECTION 3.14. REESTABLISHMENT OF NORMAL UNITS. (a) A Holder of Stripped Units may reestablish Normal Units at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, by: (i) depositing with the Collateral Agent Notes in a principal amount or the Treasury Consideration (identified and calculated by reference to the Treasury Consideration then comprising Normal Units), as the case may be, then comprising such number of Normal Units as is equal to the number of such Stripped Units; and (ii) transferring such Stripped Units to the Purchase Contract Agent accompanied by a notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant principal amount of Notes or the Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Purchase Contract Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Stripped Unit, whereupon the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, with a copy of such instruction to the Company, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Upon receipt of the Notes or the Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Purchase Contract Agent, on behalf of the Holder, such Pledged Treasury Securities from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly: (x) cancel the related Stripped Units certificate;
30 (y) transfer the Pledged Treasury Securities to the Holder; and (z) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a Normal Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 evidencing the same number of Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Stripped Units. (b) Holders of Stripped Units may reestablish Normal Units (i) if Notes are being substituted for the Pledged Treasury Securities, only in integral multiples of 40 Stripped Units for 40 Normal Units or (ii) if the reestablishment occurs after a Special Event Redemption, as the case may be, only in integral multiples of Stripped Units such that the Treasury Consideration to be deposited and the Treasury Securities to be released are in integral multiples of $1,000. (c) Except as provided in this Section 3.14, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Stripped Unit remains in effect, such Stripped Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Stripped Unit in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities and Purchase Contract comprising such Stripped Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Stripped Unit. (d) In the event a Holder who reestablishes Normal Units pursuant to this Section 3.14 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the Stripped Units or fails to deliver a Stripped Units Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent after depositing Pledged Notes with the Collateral Agent, the Treasury Securities constituting a part of such Stripped Units, and any distributions on such Treasury Securities shall be held in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Stripped Units are so transferred or the Stripped Units Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, with respect to a Stripped Units Certificate, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent that such Stripped Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company. SECTION 3.15. TRANSFER OF COLLATERAL UPON OCCURRENCE OF TERMINATION EVENT. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event and the transfer to the Purchase Contract Agent of the Notes or the Treasury Consideration or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying the Normal Units and the Stripped Units pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent shall request transfer instructions with respect to such Notes or the Treasury Consideration or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from each Holder by written request mailed to such Holder at its address as it appears in the Normal Units Register or the Stripped Units Register, as the case may be. Upon book-entry transfer of the Normal Units or Stripped Units or delivery of a Normal Units Certificate or Stripped Units Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent with such transfer instructions, the Purchase Contract Agent shall transfer the Notes, the Treasury Consideration or the Treasury Securities underlying such Normal Units or
31 Stripped Units, as the case may be, to such Holder by book-entry transfer, or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with such instructions. In the event a Holder of Normal Units or Stripped Units fails to effect such transfer or delivery, the Notes, the Treasury Consideration or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying such Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and any distributions thereon, shall be held in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Normal Units or Stripped Units are transferred or the Normal Units Certificate or Stripped Units Certificate is surrendered or such Holder provides satisfactory evidence that such Normal Units Certificate or Stripped Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company. In the case of the Treasury Portfolio or any Treasury Securities, the Purchase Contract Agent may dispose of the subject securities for cash and pay the applicable portion of such cash to the Holders in lieu of such Holders' Treasury Securities, where such Holder would otherwise have been entitled to receive less than $1,000 of any such security. SECTION 3.16. NO CONSENT TO ASSUMPTION. Each Holder of a Unit, by acceptance thereof, shall be deemed expressly to have withheld any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance), under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, of the Purchase Contract by the Company, any receiver, liquidator or person or entity performing similar functions or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or federal or other law providing for reorganization or liquidation. SECTION 3.17. CUSIP NUMBERS. The Company in issuing the Units may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Purchase Contract Agent shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices to Holders as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice to Holders and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Units, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Purchase Contract Agent of any changes in the "CUSIP" numbers. SECTION 3.18. CURRENCY OF PAYMENTS. Any cash payments under this Agreement shall be paid in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds. ARTICLE IV THE NOTES SECTION 4.1. PAYMENT OF INTEREST; RIGHTS TO INTEREST PAYMENTS PRESERVED. (a) A payment on any Note or Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, which is paid on any Payment Date shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Purchase Contract Agent from the Collateral Agent (if the Collateral Agent is the registered owner thereof) as provided by the terms of the Pledge Agreement, be paid to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Normal Units Certificates), of which such Note or the Treasury Consideration is a part, is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. (b) Each Normal Units Certificate evidencing Notes delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Normal Units Certificate shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and rights to accrue
32 interest, which were carried by the Notes or Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, underlying such other Normal Units Certificate. (c) In the case of any Normal Unit, with respect to which Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on an Early Settlement Date, or with respect to which Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on a Merger Early Settlement Date, or with respect to which Cash Settlement is effected on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution is effected, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Payment Date, payments on the Note or the Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, underlying such Normal Unit otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement, Cash Settlement or Collateral Substitution, as the case may be, and such payments shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Purchase Contract Agent, be payable to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Normal Unit Certificates) was registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Normal Unit with respect to which Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution has been effected, payments on the related Notes or payments on the Treasury Consideration that would otherwise be payable after the applicable Settlement Date or after such Collateral Substitution, as the case may be, shall not be payable hereunder to the Holder of such Normal Unit; PROVIDED that, to the extent that such Holder continues to hold the separated Notes that formerly comprised a part of such Holder's Normal Units, such Holder shall be entitled to receive any payments on such separated Notes. SECTION 4.2. NOTICE AND VOTING. The Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, at the Company's expense, to the Holders of Normal Units a notice prepared by the Company (a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Purchase Contract Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Purchase Contract Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes underlying their Normal Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of any Holder of Normal Units on such record date, the Purchase Contract Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request, the maximum number of Pledged Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Normal Unit, the Purchase Contract Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Note underlying such Normal Unit. The Company hereby agrees, if applicable, to solicit Holders of Normal Units to timely instruct the Purchase Contract Agent in writing in order to enable the Purchase Contract Agent to vote such Pledged Notes.
33 SECTION 4.3. SPECIAL EVENT REDEMPTION. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption prior to the successful remarketing of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.4, the Company shall instruct in writing the Collateral Agent to apply, and upon such written instruction, the Collateral Agent shall apply, out of the aggregate Redemption Price for the Notes that are components of Normal Units, an amount equal to the Special Event Redemption Principal Amount to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Normal Units the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such Redemption Price to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of such Normal Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Notes, and will be pledged to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement to secure the obligation of each Holder of a Normal Unit to purchase the Ordinary Shares under the Purchase Contract constituting a part of such Normal Unit. Following the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption prior to a successful remarketing of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.4, the Holders of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in Articles II, III, IV, V and VI of the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Note shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Normal Unit Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of the Treasury Portfolio for Notes as collateral. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption after the successful remarketing of the Notes or after the Stock Purchase Date, the Redemption Price will be payable in cash to the holders of the Notes. ARTICLE V THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS; THE REMARKETING SECTION 5.1. PURCHASE OF ORDINARY SHARES. (a) Each Purchase Contract shall, unless a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred prior to the Stock Purchase Date, obligate the Holder of the related Unit to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $25 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable newly issued Ordinary Shares equal to the Settlement Rate or, if we have fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f), the Fixed Settlement Rate. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to, (i) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $93.99 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 0.2660 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, (ii) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price, but is greater than $75.19 (the "Reference Price"), the number of Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Applicable Market Value, and
34 (iii) if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or less than the Reference Price, 0.3325 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.6 (and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). (b) No fractional Ordinary Shares will be issued by the Company with respect to the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Stock Purchase Date. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable with respect to such payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, the Holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash as provided in Section 5.12. (c) The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per Ordinary Share on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date or, in the event of a Cash Merger, the Cash Merger Date. The "Closing Price" of the Ordinary Shares on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Ordinary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Ordinary Shares are not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Ordinary Shares are so listed, or if the Ordinary Shares are not so listed on a United States securities exchange, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, or, if the Ordinary Shares are not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Ordinary Shares in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Ordinary Shares on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Ordinary Shares (A) are not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) have traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Ordinary Shares at the close of business on such day. (d) Each Holder of a Unit, by its acceptance thereof, irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contract on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact (including the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder), agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contract, consents to the provisions hereof, irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent as its attorney-in-fact to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to and agrees to be bound by the Pledge of the Notes, the Treasury Consideration or the Treasury Securities pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; PROVIDED that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Unit under the Purchase Contract may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. (e) Upon registration of transfer of a Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee) under the terms of this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts underlying such Certificate and the Pledge Agreement, and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts underlying the Certificate so transferred and the Pledge Agreement. The Company
35 covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Certificate, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. (f) If an Accounting Settlement Rate Event occurs and is continuing at any time prior to the earlier of the date of any successful remarketing of the Notes and the Stock Purchase Date, the Company may elect to fix the Settlement Rate in accordance with the Black-Scholes option pricing formula for European call options as described under "Description of the Equity Security Units--Fixed Settlement Rate Option Upon Accounting Event" in the Company's prospectus supplement, dated March 17, 2004, to the prospectus dated June 19, 2003 (the "Fixing Formula") (the new Settlement Rate referred to as the "Fixed Settlement Rate"). If the Company elects to fix the Settlement Rate, the Company must prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth its intention to fix the Settlement Rate. The Fixed Settlement Rate shall be determined by a calculation agent selected by the Company in good faith, which such calculation agent shall be a nationally recognized investment bank. Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the expiration of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period commencing the third Trading Day following the date of such Officers' Certificate, the Company will be required, in accordance with Section 5.7, to prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an additional Officers' Certificate setting forth the calculation of the Fixed Settlement Rate in accordance with the Fixing Formula and the effective date of the Fixed Settlement Rate. In no event will the Fixed Settlement Rate be greater than 0.3325, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.6. The Fixed Settlement Rate will become effective at the open of business two Business Days after the close of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period. The Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.6. The Fixed Settlement Rate determined by the Calculation Agent shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. SECTION 5.2. CONTRACT ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS. (a) Contract Adjustment Payments shall accumulate on each Purchase Contract constituting a part of a Unit at 3.97% per year of the Stated Amount of such Unit, from March 23, 2004 through but excluding the Stock Purchase Date, PROVIDED that no Contract Adjustment Payment shall accrue after an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement. Subject to Section 5.3, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) is registered on the Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date in such coin or currency of the United States as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for payments. The Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, or, if the Units do not remain in book-entry only form, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to the account maintained in the United States designated by written notice given ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date by such Person. (b) Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company's obligation to pay Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments), if any, shall cease.
36 (c) Each Certificate delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Certificate (including as a result of a Collateral Substitution or the re-establishment of a Normal Unit) shall carry the rights to receive Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments), if any, and to accrue Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, which were carried by the Purchase Contracts underlying such other Certificates. (d) Subject to Sections 5.4, 5.9 and 5.10, in the case of any Unit with respect to which Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on an Early Settlement Date or a Merger Early Settlement Date, respectively, or in respect of which Cash Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution or a reestablishment of a Normal Unit pursuant to Section 3.14 is effected, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Payment Date, Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contract underlying such Unit otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Cash Settlement, Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement, Collateral Substitution or a reestablishment of Normal Units, and such Contract Adjustment Payments shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Purchase Contract Agent, be payable to the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Unit (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) was registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Unit with respect to which Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement on an Early Settlement Date or Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, that would otherwise be payable after the Early Settlement Date, or Merger Early Settlement Date, with respect to such Purchase Contract shall not be payable. (e) The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments) will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Senior Indebtedness to the extent set forth in Section 5.2(f). (f) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.8, in the event (x) of any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, or (y) subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(h) below, that (i) a default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the payment of principal, interest or any other monetary amounts due and payable on any Senior Indebtedness and such default shall have continued beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument evidencing such Senior Indebtedness (and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued), or (ii) the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness shall have been accelerated because of a default in respect of such Senior Indebtedness (and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees
37 under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued), then: (i) the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive, in the case of clause (x) above, payment in full of all amounts due or to become due upon all Senior Indebtedness and, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii) of clause (y) above, payment of all amounts due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of any of the Units are entitled to receive any Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units; (ii) any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of any of the Units would be entitled except for the provisions of Sections 5.2(e) through (q), including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units, shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of such Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made of such Contract Adjustment Payments to the Holders of such Units; and (iii) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units, shall be received by the Purchase Contract Agent or the Holders of any of the Units when such payment or distribution is prohibited pursuant to Sections 5.2(e) through (q), such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
38 (g) For purposes of Sections 5.2(e) through (q), the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Sections 5.2(e) through (q) with respect to such Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Units to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; PROVIDED that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. (h) Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under Senior Indebtedness, other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Sections 5.2(e) through (g) shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation, shall not be deemed a default or event of default if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company which is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, and (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review. (i) Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all such Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments owing on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by virtue of Sections 5.2(e) through (q) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Sections 5.2(e) through (q) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand. (j) Nothing contained in Sections 5.2(e) through (q) or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Units is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors
39 other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which, subject to the occurrence of a Termination Event as described in Section 5.2(b) and the Company's right pursuant to Section 5.3 to defer Contract Adjustment Payments, is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under these Sections 5.2(e) through (q), of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. (k) Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in these Sections 5.2(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to these Sections 5.2(e) through (q). (l) The Purchase Contract Agent shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Purchase Contract Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Sections 5.2(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchase Contract Agent as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Sections 5.2(e) through (q), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Purchase Contract Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. (m) Nothing contained in Sections 5.2(e) through (q) shall affect the obligations of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments, except as provided in these Sections 5.2(e) through (q). (n) Each Holder of Units, by his acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Purchase Contract Agent on his, her or its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in Sections 5.2(e) through (q) and appoints
40 the Purchase Contract Agent his, her or its attorney-in-fact, as the case may be, for any and all such purposes. (o) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.2(e) through (q) or any other provisions of this Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent, or the taking of any other action by the Purchase Contract Agent, unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company, any Holder, any paying agent or the holder or representative of any Senior Indebtedness; PROVIDED that, if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section 5.2(o), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Purchase Contract Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to or on or after such date. (p) The Purchase Contract Agent in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section 5.2 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness at the time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive the Purchase Contract Agent of any of its rights as such holder. (q) No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. (r) Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Purchase Contract Agent under or pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof. With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, (i) the duties and obligations of the Purchase Contract Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement; (iii) no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Purchase Contract Agent; and (iv) the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary as to such holders. SECTION 5.3. DEFERRAL OF CONTRACT ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS. (a) The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Purchase Contract Agent written notice of its election to defer each such deferred Contract Adjustment Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at
41 least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Adjustment Payments to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of the Units, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 6.50% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, being referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to this Section 5.3. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Settlement Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. If the Purchase Contracts are terminated upon the occurrence of a Termination Event or Early Settlement, the Holder's right to receive Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, will terminate. (b) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. (c) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Stock Purchase Date, each Holder will receive on the Stock Purchase Date in lieu of a cash payment a number of Ordinary Shares (in addition to a number of Ordinary Shares equal to the Settlement Rate or, if the Settlement Rate has been fixed pursuant to Section 5.1(f), the Fixed Settlement Rate) equal to (A) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to such Holder (net of any required tax withholding on such Deferred Contract Adjustment Payment, which shall be remitted to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction) divided by (B) the Applicable Market Value. (d) No fractional Ordinary Shares will be issued by the Company with respect to the payment of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Stock Purchase Date. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable with respect to such payment of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, the Holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash as provided in Section 5.12. (e) In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments then, until the date on which the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the Company to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Ordinary Shares other than: (i) repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of Ordinary Shares of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other
42 similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a share purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its right to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in the Company's Capital Stock (or rights to acquire the Company's Capital Stock) or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of the Company's Capital Stock in exchange for or out of the net cash proceeds of the sale of the Company's Capital Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's Capital Stock); or (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan on the date the Company exercises its right to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights pursuant thereto. SECTION 5.4. PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE; REMARKETING. (a) Unless a Special Event Redemption or Termination Event has occurred, or a Holder of a Unit has settled the underlying Purchase Contract through an Early Settlement pursuant to Section 5.9 or a Merger Early Settlement pursuant to Section 5.10, each Holder of a Normal Unit may pay in cash ("Cash Settlement") the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares to be purchased pursuant to a Purchase Contract if such Holder notifies the Purchase Contract Agent by surrender of the Normal Unit Certificate, if in certificated form, and delivery of a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto of its intention to make a Cash Settlement. Such notice shall be made on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. The Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent of the receipt of such a notice from a Holder intending to make a Cash Settlement. (i) A Holder of a Normal Unit who has so notified the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement is required to pay the Purchase Price to the Collateral Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashier's check or wire transfer, in each case in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Collateral Agent for deposit in the Collateral Account. Any cash received by the Collateral Agent will be paid to the Company on the Stock Purchase Date in settlement of the Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of this
43 Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, and any funds received by the Collateral Agent in excess of the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares to be purchased by such Holder shall be distributed to the Purchase Contract Agent when received for payment to the Holder. (ii) If a Holder of a Normal Unit fails to notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) above, the Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Notes pursuant to the remarketing as described in paragraph (b) below. If a Holder of a Normal Unit does notify the Purchase Contract Agent as provided in paragraph (a)(i) above of its intention to pay the Purchase Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph (a)(i) above, the Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Notes pursuant to the remarketing as described in paragraph (b) below. (b) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred, the Company shall engage, no later than 30 days prior to the Remarketing Date, a nationally recognized investment bank (the "Remarketing Agent") pursuant to a Remarketing Agreement to be entered into between the Company and the Remarketing Agent, but providing for remarketing procedures substantially as set forth below to sell the Notes of Holders of Normal Units, other than Holders that have elected not to participate in the remarketing pursuant to the procedures set forth in clause (iv) below, and holders of Separate Notes that have elected to participate in the remarketing pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 4.5(d) of the Pledge Agreement and Section 2.20 of the First Supplemental Indenture. The Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, at the Company's request, shall notify (the "Remarketing Notice"), not later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date, Holders of Normal Units, and holders of Separate Notes, of the remarketing to take place on the Remarketing Date, and if necessary, on the eighth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, and if necessary, on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, and if necessary, on the sixth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, and if necessary, on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, and if necessary, on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, and if necessary, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date (each such date other than the Remarketing Date a "Subsequent Remarketing Date") (and if such Normal Units or Separate Notes are held in global form, the Company, or the Purchase Contract Agent, at the Company's request, will cause the Clearing Agency to notify the Clearing Agency Participants of such remarketing by no later than the seventh Business Day preceding the Remarketing Date). The Remarketing Notice will include the amount of cash that must be delivered by the Holders of Normal Units that elect not to participate in the remarketing and the deadline for such delivery, as well as information with respect to the exercise of the Put Right (as defined in the First Supplemental Indenture). The Purchase Contract Agent shall notify, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the eleventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the Remarketing Agent and the Collateral Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of Normal Unit Holders to be remarketed. On the eleventh Business Day preceding the Stock Purchase Date, no later than by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Custodial Agent will notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Notes to
44 be remarketed. No later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the tenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will deliver for remarketing to the Remarketing Agent all Notes to be remarketed. Upon receipt of such notice from the Purchase Contract Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Notes from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Remarketing Date, and if necessary, on each Subsequent Remarketing Date, use its reasonable best efforts to sell such Notes on such dates at an aggregate price equal to 100.25% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket such Notes at a price equal to 100.25% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, the proceeds will be paid to the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Company, in direct settlement of the obligations of the Holders under the related Purchase Contracts to purchase Ordinary Shares of the Company. In the event of a successful remarketing pursuant to this Section 5.4, the Remarketing Agent will deduct as a remarketing fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the Remarketing Value of such Notes (the "Remarketing Fee"). The Remarketing Agent will remit (1) to the Custodial Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Separate Notes that were remarketed, the portion of the proceeds from the remarketing attributable to such Separate Notes and (2) the remaining portion of the proceeds, less those proceeds paid to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, and used to pay the Company in direct settlement of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Normal Units that were remarketed, all determined on a pro rata basis, in each case, on or prior to the third Business Day following the date on which the Notes were successfully remarketed. Holders whose Notes are so remarketed will not otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. (ii) If, in spite of using its reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to 100.25% of the principal amount of the Notes included in the remarketing on the Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent will attempt to establish a Remarketing Rate meeting these requirements on each of the Subsequent Remarketing Dates. If, in spite of using its reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent fails to remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to 100.25% of the principal amount of the Notes included in the remarketing on or before 4:00 p.m., New York City time on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the remarketing will be deemed to have failed (the "Last Failed Remarketing"), and in this case, the Remarketing Agent will agree to advise the Collateral Agent in writing that it cannot remarket the Notes. Within three Business Days following the date of the Last Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return any Notes delivered to it to the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, as applicable. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company may exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Notes, including those actions specified in (b) (iii) below; PROVIDED that if upon the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent exercises such rights for the benefit of the Company with respect to such Notes, any accumulated and unpaid interest on such Notes will become payable by the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the Normal Units to which such Notes relate. Such payment will be made by the
45 Company on or prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Stock Purchase Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashier's check or wire transfer in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Purchase Contract Agent. The Company will cause a notice of any failed remarketing and of the Last Failed Remarketing to be published before 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following each failed remarketing and the Last Failed Remarketing, as the case may be. The Company will also release this information by means of Bloomberg and Reuters newswire (or any successor or equivalent of such newswires). (iii) With respect to any Notes which constitute part of Normal Units which are subject to the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company reserves all of its rights as a secured party with respect thereto and, subject to applicable law and Section 5.4 (e) below, may, among other things permit the Company to, (A) retain and cancel such Notes or (B) cause the Notes to be sold, in either case, in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts. (iv) A Holder of Normal Units may elect not to participate in the remarketing and retain the Notes underlying such Units by notifying the Purchase Contract Agent of such election and delivering the requisite amount of cash in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashier's check or wire transfer, in each case, in immediately available funds, equal to the Purchase Price per Purchase Contract (the "Cash Consideration") to the Purchase Contract Agent not later than 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the thirteenth Business Day prior to the Stock Purchase Date as set forth in the Remarketing Notice and following the procedures to exchange its Normal Units for Stripped Units (substituting references to Treasury Securities with references to Cash Consideration) as described in Section 3.13 (an "Opt-Out"). In such event, all references to the Treasury Securities or Pledged Treasury Securities herein, including for purposes of Sections 3.15 and 5.8, shall be deemed to include such Cash Consideration in addition to the Treasury Securities. Upon receipt thereof by the Purchase Contract Agent, the Purchase Contract Agent shall deliver such Cash Consideration to the Collateral Agent, which will for the benefit of the Company, thereupon apply such Cash Consideration to secure such Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contracts. On the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Remarketing Period, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will deliver the Pledged Notes of such Holder to the Purchase Contract Agent and within three Business Days thereof, the Purchase Contract Agent shall distribute such Notes to the Holders thereof. A Holder that does not so deliver the requisite Cash Consideration or does not so notify the Agent of its election not to participate in the remarketing pursuant to this clause (iv) shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the remarketing. Any Cash Consideration received by the Collateral Agent will be paid to the Company on the Stock Purchase Date in settlement of the Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, and any funds received by the Collateral Agent in excess of the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares to be
46 purchased by such Holder shall be distributed to the Purchase Contract Agent when received for payment to the Holder. (c) Upon the maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying the Stripped Units and, in the event of a Special Event Redemption, the Pledged Treasury Consideration underlying the Normal Units, on the Stock Purchase Date the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price applicable to such Units, as payment for the Ordinary Shares issuable upon settlement thereof without needing to receive any instructions from the Holders of such Units. In the event the payments in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities or the Pledged Treasury Consideration underlying a Unit is in excess of the Purchase Price of the Purchase Contract being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent will distribute such excess to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holder of such Unit when received. (d) Any distribution to Holders of excess funds and interest described in Section 5.4 (b) and (c) above shall be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, or, if the Units do not remain in book-entry only form, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to the account maintained in the United States designated by written notice given ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date by such Person. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Pledge Agreement, subject to Section 3.2 of the Pledge Agreement, the obligations of each Holder to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders (except to the extent paid by Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement) and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such payments and the Purchase Price. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any Ordinary Shares in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder of the related Unit unless the Company shall have (i) received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares to be purchased thereunder by such Holder in the manner herein set forth or (ii) become entitled to exercise its rights as a secured party under Section 5.4(b)(iii). SECTION 5.5. ISSUANCE OF ORDINARY SHARES. Unless a Termination Event shall have occurred on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date or an Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred, on the Stock Purchase Date, upon the Company's receipt of payment in full of the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares purchased by the Holders pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article and subject to Section 5.6(b) or the Company's exercise of its rights as a secured party pursuant to Section 5.4(b)(iii), the Company shall issue and deposit with the Purchase Contract Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Units, one or more certificates representing the newly issued Ordinary Shares, registered in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for Ordinary Shares, together with any dividends or distributions for which both a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Stock
47 Purchase Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Contract Settlement Fund"), to which the Holders are entitled hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent on or after the Stock Purchase Date, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole Ordinary Shares which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article V (after taking into account all Units then held by such Holder) together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.12 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Purchase Contract Agent. If any Ordinary Shares issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered, no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of such Certificate or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable. SECTION 5.6. ADJUSTMENT OF SETTLEMENT RATE. (a) Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc. (1) Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company: (A) pays a dividend or makes another distribution to all holders of the Company's Ordinary Shares payable exclusively in Ordinary Shares on the Company's Ordinary Shares; (B) subdivides or splits the outstanding Ordinary Shares into a greater number of shares; or (C) combines the outstanding Ordinary Shares into a smaller number of shares, then the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the Holder of a Purchase Contract forming a part of a Unit thereafter settled may receive the number of Ordinary Shares which such Holder would have owned immediately following such action if such Holder had settled the Purchase Contract immediately prior to such action. The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend, distribution or subdivision and immediately after the effective date in the case of a combination. (2) Adjustment for Rights Issue. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company distributes any rights, options or warrants to all holders of the Company's Ordinary Shares entitling them to purchase or subscribe for, for a period expiring within 60 days, Ordinary Shares at a price per share less than the Current Market Price as of the Time of Determination (except that no adjustment will be made if Holders of the Units may participate in the distribution on a basis and with the notice that the Company's Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate), the Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: (O + N) R' = R x -------------------- (O + (N x P)/M)
48 where: R' = the adjusted Settlement Rate. R = the current Settlement Rate. O = the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 5.6(a)(2) is being applied. N = the number of additional Ordinary Shares offered pursuant to the distribution. P = the offering price per share of the additional shares. M = the Current Market Price. The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive the rights, warrants or options to which this Section 5.6(a)(2) applies. If all of the Ordinary Shares subject to such rights, warrants or options have not been issued when such rights, warrants or options expire, then the Settlement Rate shall promptly be readjusted to the Settlement Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such rights, warrants or options been made on the basis of the actual number of Ordinary Shares issued upon the exercise of such rights, warrants or options. No adjustment shall be made under this Section 5.6(a)(2) if the application of the formula stated above in this Section 5.6(a)(2) would result in a value of R' that is equal to or less than the value of R. (3) Adjustments for Other Distributions. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company dividends or distributes to all holders of its Ordinary Shares any of its debt, Capital Stock, securities or assets or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company (including securities or cash, but excluding (x) distributions of Capital Stock referred to in Section 5.6(a)(1)(A) and distributions of rights, warrants or options referred to in Section 5.6(a)(2) and (y) dividends or distributions that are paid exclusively in cash) the Settlement Rate shall be adjusted, subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of this Section 5.6(a)(3), in accordance with the formula: M R' = R x ------- (M-F) where: R' = the adjusted Settlement Rate.
49 R = the current Settlement Rate. M = the Current Market Price. F = the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 5.6(a)(3) applies) of the debt, Capital Stock, assets, securities, rights, warrants or options to be distributed in respect of each Ordinary Share in the distribution to which this Section 5.6(a)(3) is being applied (including, in the case of cash dividends or other cash distributions giving rise to an adjustment, all such cash distributed concurrently). In the event the Company distributes shares of Capital Stock of a subsidiary, the Settlement Rate will be adjusted, if at all, based on the market value of the subsidiary stock so distributed relative to the market value of the Ordinary Shares, as discussed below. The Board of Directors shall determine fair market values for the purposes of this Section 5.6(a)(3), except that in respect of a dividend or other distribution of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a "Spin-off"), the fair market value of the securities to be distributed shall equal the average of the daily Closing Prices of those securities for the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the sixth day of trading of those securities after the effectiveness of the Spin-off. In the event, however, that an underwritten initial public offering of the securities in the Spin-off occurs simultaneously with the Spin-off, fair market value of the securities distributed in the Spin-off shall mean the initial public offering price of such securities and the Current Market Price shall mean the Closing Price for the Ordinary Shares on the same Trading Day. The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive the distribution to which this Section 5.6(a)(3) applies, except that an adjustment related to a Spin-off shall become effective at the earlier to occur of (i) 10 Trading Days after the effective date of the Spin-off and (ii) the initial public offering of the securities distributed in the Spin-off. (4) Cash Distributions. In case the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall, by dividend or otherwise, pay regular quarterly, semi-annual or annual cash dividends or make any other distributions consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of its Ordinary Shares, excluding any cash dividend or distribution on the Ordinary Shares to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend or distribution per Ordinary Share in any quarter does not exceed $0.49 (the "Dividend Threshold Amount") (the Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to adjustment on the same basis as the Settlement Rate, provided that no adjustment shall be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (4)) then, in such case, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on such date less the amount of cash so distributed applicable to one Ordinary Share in excess of the Dividend Threshold Amount; and the denominator shall be the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on such date, such adjustment to be effective at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution; provided that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one
50 Ordinary Share in excess of the Dividend Threshold Amount is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on such date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder of a Unit shall have the right to receive upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts such excess amount. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Settlement Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (5) Adjustment for Company Tender Offer. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company or any subsidiary of the Company pays holders of the Ordinary Shares in respect of a tender or exchange offer, other than an odd-lot offer, by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for Ordinary Shares to the extent that the offer involves aggregate consideration that, together with (i) any cash and the fair market value of any other consideration payable in respect of any tender offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for shares of Ordinary Shares consummated within the preceding 12 months not triggering a Settlement Rate adjustment and (ii) all-cash distributions to all or substantially all holders of Ordinary Shares made within the preceding 12 months (other than regular quarterly, semi-annual or annual cash dividends), exceeds an amount equal to 12.5% of the market capitalization of the Ordinary Shares on the expiration date of the tender offer, the Settlement Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Settlement Rate increase contemplated by this Section 5.6(a)(5) by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) at the last time tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "Expiration Time") multiplied by the current market value per Ordinary Share on the Trading Day on the NYSE next succeeding the Expiration Time and the numerator shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares") and (y) the product of the number of Ordinary Shares (less any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time and the current market value per Ordinary Share on the Trading Day on the NYSE next succeeding the Expiration Time, such increase to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. (6) Calculation of Adjustments. All adjustments to the Settlement Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of an Ordinary Share (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or a decrease of at least one percent; provided that any adjustments not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment and notwithstanding whether or not such one percent threshold shall have been met, all such adjustments shall be made on the Stock Purchase Date. If an adjustment is made to the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1) through (5) or (7) of this Section 5.6(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Settlement Rate in Section 5.1(a) will apply on the Stock Purchase Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate
51 immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1) through (5) or (7) of this Section 5.6(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately before such adjustment; provided that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1) through (5) or (7) of this Section 5.6(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. (7) Increase of Settlement Rate. The Company may make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of Ordinary Shares resulting from any dividend or distribution of Capital Stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons. (8) When No Adjustment Required. No adjustment to the Settlement Rate need be made as a result of: (i) the issuance of the rights; (ii) the distribution of separate certificates representing the rights; (iii) the exercise or redemption of the rights in accordance with any rights agreement; or (iv) the termination or invalidation of the rights, in each case, pursuant to the Company's stockholders rights plan existing on the date of this Agreement, as amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time or any newly adopted stockholders rights plans; provided, however that to the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect upon settlement of a Purchase Contract (including the Company's rights plan existing on the date of this Agreement), the Holder shall receive, in addition to the Ordinary Shares, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to any settlement of a Purchase Contract, the rights have separated from the Ordinary Shares, in which case the Settlement Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company made a distribution to all holders of its Ordinary Shares as described in clause (3) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the rights. In addition, no adjustment to the Settlement Rate need be made: (A) upon the issuance of any Ordinary Shares pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in Ordinary Shares under any plan; (B) upon the issuance of any Ordinary Shares or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (C) upon the issuance of any Ordinary Shares pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Units were first issued. No adjustment to the Settlement Rate need be made for a transaction referred to in 5.6(a)(2) or 5.6(a)(3) if Holders of the Units may participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Ordinary Shares participate in the transaction. No adjustment to
52 the Settlement Rate need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Ordinary Shares. (9) Use of Terms. "Time of Determination" means the time and date of the earlier of (i) the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights, warrants or options or a distribution in each case, to which Section 5.6(a)(2) or Section 5.6(a)(3) applies and (ii) the time ("Ex-Dividend Time") immediately prior to the commencement of "ex-dividend" trading for such rights, warrants or options or distribution on the NYSE or such other U.S. national or regional exchange or market on which the Ordinary Shares are then listed or quoted. "Current Market Price" means the average of the Closing Prices of the Ordinary Shares for the five consecutive Trading Day period ending on the third Business Day ending on the earlier of the day in question and the day before the "ex date" with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such computation. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the Ordinary Shares trade regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive the issuance or distribution. (b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event. In the event of (1) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation are not exchanged for cash, securities other property of the Company or another corporation), (2) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, (3) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or any binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Ordinary Shares, or (4) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any such event, a "Reorganization Event"), each Ordinary Share covered by each Purchase Contract forming part of a Unit immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, after such Reorganization Event, be converted for purposes of the Purchase Contract into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon which have a record date that is prior to the Stock Purchase Date) per Ordinary Share by a holder of Ordinary Shares that (i) is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "Constituent Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event
53 provides for different treatment of Ordinary Shares held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates, and (ii) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (PROVIDED that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each Ordinary Share held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("Non-electing Share"), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each Non-electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per Ordinary Share by a plurality of the Non-electing Shares). On the Stock Purchase Date, the Settlement Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on the Stock Purchase Date of such securities, cash or other property. In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each Outstanding Unit shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.6. Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events. (c) Successive Adjustments. After an adjustment to the Settlement Rate under this Section 5.6, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 5.6 shall cause an adjustment to the Settlement Rate as so adjusted. (d) Multiple Adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.6 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder. SECTION 5.7. NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS. (a) Whenever the Settlement Rate is adjusted as herein provided or the Settlement Rate is fixed pursuant to Section 5.1(f), the Company shall as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires or permits the Settlement Rate to be adjusted or fixed, (i) provide written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of the occurrence of that event and (ii) compute the Settlement Rate and the Applicable Market Value in accordance with Section 5.6 or, in the case of a fixing of the Settlement Rate, pursuant to Section 5.1(f), and prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Settlement Rate and the Applicable Market Value or the Fixed Settlement Rate, as the case may be, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based (which Officers' Certificate, in the case of the fixing of the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) shall be delivered by such time and date as specified in Section 5.1(f)).
54 (b) The Purchase Contract Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Settlement Rate and the Applicable Market Value, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Ordinary Shares, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract, and the Purchase Contract Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any Ordinary Shares pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. SECTION 5.8. TERMINATION EVENT; NOTICE. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of Holders to receive Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments and obligations of Holders to purchase Ordinary Shares, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Normal Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Notes or the Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, forming a part of such Normal Units, and the Stripped Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Treasury Securities forming a part of such Stripped Units, in each case in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 of the Pledge Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Register. SECTION 5.9. EARLY SETTLEMENT. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.9, Purchase Contracts underlying Units having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof may, at the option of the Holder thereof, be settled early ("Early Settlement") on or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. Holders of Stripped Units may only effect Early Settlement of the related Purchase Contracts in integral multiples of 40 Stripped Units, and if Treasury Consideration has been substituted for the Notes as a component in the Normal Units due to the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, Purchase Contracts underlying such Normal Units may only be settled early in integral multiples of Normal Units such that the Treasury Consideration to be deposited and the Treasury Consideration to be released are in integral multiples of $1,000. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing the related Units shall deliver such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment payable to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount (the "Early Settlement Amount") equal to (A) the product of (i) the Purchase Price multiplied by (ii) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of
55 business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts; PROVIDED that no payment shall be required pursuant to clause (B) of this sentence if the Company shall have elected to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments which would otherwise be payable on such Payment Date. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and subject to Section 5.2(d), no payment or adjustment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contract on any Contract Adjustment Payments accrued on such Purchase Contract or on account of any dividends on the Ordinary Shares issued upon such Early Settlement. If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying any Unit at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, such day shall be the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Unit and if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Units shall be the next succeeding Business Day. (b) No later than the third Business Day after an Early Settlement of any Purchase Contract by the Holder of the related Units, the Company shall issue, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, 0.2660 Ordinary Shares on account of such Purchase Contract (the "Early Settlement Rate"), or, if the Company has fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) of this Agreement, the Fixed Settlement Rate. The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6. As promptly as practicable after Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.9, the Company shall issue and shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office a certificate or certificates for the full number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon such Early Settlement together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.12. (c) No later than the third Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date the Company shall cause (i) the Ordinary Shares issuable upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts to be issued and delivered, and (ii) the related Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, in the case of Normal Units, or the related Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of Stripped Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or the Holder's designee. (d) Upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts, and subject to receipt of Ordinary Shares from the Company and the Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from the Collateral Agent, as applicable, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Units, (i) transfer to the Holder the Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, forming a part of such Units, and (ii) deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the full number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon such Early Settlement together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.12. (e) In the event that Early Settlement is effected with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying less than all the Units evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early
56 Settlement the Company shall execute and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate and execute on behalf of the Holder and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Units as to which Early Settlement was not effected. (f) No Early Settlement will be permitted under this Section 5.9 unless, at the time of delivery of the Election to Settle Early form or the time the Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective shelf or other registration statement with respect to the Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered in connection with such Early Settlement (unless the Company has been advised by counsel that no such registration statement is required under the Securities Act and that no prospectus is required to be delivered in connection therewith). In addition, the Company may suspend the use of any such prospectus up to four times in any 360-day period not to exceed 90 days in any such 360-day period if (i) any such prospectus would, in the Company's judgment, contain a material misstatement or omission as a result of an event that has occurred and is continuing or as a result of any proposed or pending material business transaction, event or announcement; and (ii) the Company reasonably determines that the disclosure of such material non-public information could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or could impede the consummation of any proposed or pending material business transaction. SECTION 5.10. EARLY SETTLEMENT UPON CASH MERGER. (a) Prior to the Stock Purchase Date, in the event of a merger or consolidation of the Company of the type described in clause (1) of Section 5.6(b) in which the Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation are exchanged for consideration consisting of at least 30% cash or cash equivalents (any such event a "Cash Merger"), then the Company (or the successor to the Company hereunder) shall be required to offer the Holder of each Unit the right to settle the Purchase Contract underlying such Unit prior to the Stock Purchase Date ("Merger Early Settlement") as provided herein. On or before the fifth Business Day after the consummation of a Cash Merger, the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, shall give all Holders notice of the occurrence of the Cash Merger and of the right of Merger Early Settlement arising as a result thereof. The Company shall also deliver a copy of such notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent. Each such notice shall contain: (i) the date, which shall be not less than 20 or more than 30 calendar days after the date of such notice, on which the Merger Early Settlement will be effected (the "Merger Early Settlement Date"); (ii) the date, which shall be on or one Business Day prior to the Merger Early Settlement Date, by which the Merger Early Settlement right must be exercised; (iii) the Settlement Rate in effect as a result of such Cash Merger and the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable by the Holder upon settlement of each Purchase Contract pursuant to Section 5.6(b);
57 (iv) a statement to the effect that all or a portion of the Purchase Price payable by the Holder to settle the Purchase Contract will be offset against the amount of cash so receivable upon exercise of Merger Early Settlement, as applicable; and (v) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise the Merger Early Settlement right. (b) To exercise a Merger Early Settlement right, a Holder shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date specified in the notice the Certificate(s) evidencing the Units, if the Units are held in certificated form, with respect to which the Merger Early Settlement right is being exercised duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment payable to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount equal to the Early Settlement Amount less the amount of cash that otherwise would be deliverable by the Company or its successor upon settlement of the Purchase Contract in lieu of Ordinary Shares pursuant to Section 5.6(b) and as described in the notice to Holders (the "Merger Early Settlement Amount"). (c) On the Merger Early Settlement Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered (i) the net cash, securities and other property to be received by such exercising Holder, equal to the Settlement Rate or if the Company has fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f), the Fixed Settlement Rate, as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6, in respect of the number of Purchase Contracts for which such Merger Early Settlement right was exercised, and (ii) the related Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, in the case of Normal Units, or Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of Stripped Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Corporate Trust Office for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee. In the event a Merger Early Settlement right shall be exercised by a Holder in accordance with the terms hereof, all references herein to Stock Purchase Date shall be deemed to refer to such Merger Early Settlement Date. If a Holder effects a Merger Early Settlement of some or all of its Purchase Contracts, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the Merger Early Settlement Date, the aggregate amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments and any accumulated and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments since the immediately preceding Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts. The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by the Holders to effect such Specified Merger Early Settlement and in any remainder in the form of a cash payment. (d) Upon Merger Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts, and subject to receipt of such net cash, securities or other property from the Company and the Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from the Collateral Agent, as applicable, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Units, (i) transfer to the Holder the Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, forming a part of such Units, and (ii) deliver to the Holder such net cash, securities or other property issuable upon such Merger Early Settlement together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.12.
58 (e) In the event that Merger Early Settlement is effected with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying less than all the Units evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Merger Early Settlement the Company (or the successor to the Company hereunder) shall execute and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Units as to which Merger Early Settlement was not effected. SECTION 5.11. CHARGES AND TAXES. The Company will pay all stock transfer, stamp and similar taxes or duties attributable to the initial issuance and delivery of the Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Purchase Contracts and in payment of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments; provided that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any exchange of or substitution for a Certificate evidencing a Unit or any issuance of a Ordinary Share in a name other than that of the registered Holder of a Certificate surrendered in respect of the Units evidenced thereby, other than in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent, as custodian for such Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such Certificate or Ordinary Share unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the transfer or issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. SECTION 5.12. NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional Ordinary Shares shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on the Stock Purchase Date or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts. If Certificates evidencing more than one Purchase Contract shall be surrendered for settlement at one time by the same Holder, the number of full Ordinary Shares which shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Purchase Contracts evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered. Instead of any fractional Ordinary Share which would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Purchase Contracts on the applicable Settlement Date or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, the Company, through the Purchase Contract Agent, shall make a cash payment in respect of such fractional shares in an amount equal to the value of such fractional shares times the Applicable Market Value. The Company shall provide the Purchase Contract Agent with sufficient funds to permit the Purchase Contract Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.12 in a timely manner. ARTICLE VI REMEDIES SECTION 6.1. UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PURCHASE CONTRACT ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS AND PURCHASE ORDINARY SHARES. The Holder of any Unit shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, (a) subject to the right of the Company to defer payment thereof pursuant to Section 5.3, and to the forfeiture of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments upon Early Settlement pursuant to Section 5.9 or upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, to receive payment of each installment of the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, with respect to the Purchase Contract constituting a part of such Unit on the respective Payment Date for such Unit,

The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, if required by applicable law, a registration statement with regard to the full amount of the Notes to be remarketed in the remarketing shall be effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a form that will enable the Remarketing Agent to rely on it in connection with such remarketing. SECTION 10.8. SECURITIES CONTRACT. Without limiting the applicability of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, it is the intention of the Company that this Agreement shall constitute a "securities contract" for purposes of and subject to the provisions of Section 555 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company agrees that (i) prior to an exercise by the Collateral Agent on
72 behalf of the Company of its rights as a secured party pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Company does not have any ownership right, title or interest in and to the Pledged Notes and (ii) the Holders of a Security shall not be deemed to have purchased, and the Company shall not be deemed to have sold any Ordinary Shares pursuant to a Purchase Contract related to such Security prior to a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or the occurrence of the Stock Purchase Date (provided that no prior occurrence of a Termination Event with respect to such Ordinary Shares has occurred). SECTION 10.9. PAYMENT TO HOLDERS OF UNITS ON THE STOCK PURCHASE DATE. Each Holder of a Unit, by its acceptance thereof, further covenants and agrees that, to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.4 and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect of the Pledged Notes, the Pledged Treasury Consideration or the Pledged Treasury Securities to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase Ordinary Shares under the Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. SECTION 10.10. CONSENT TO TREATMENT FOR TAX PURPOSES. The Company and each Holder of a Normal Unit or a Stripped Unit, by its acceptance thereof, covenants and agrees (a) to treat a Holder's acquisition of the Normal Unit as the acquisition of the Note and Purchase Contract constituting the Normal Unit, (b) to treat a Holder's acquisition of a Stripped Unit as the acquisition of a Treasury Security and Purchase Contract constituting the Stripped Unit, (c) to treat each Holder as the owner, for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes of (i) the related Notes or the Treasury Consideration, in the case of the Normal Units, or (ii) the Treasury Securities, in the case of the Stripped Units, (d) to treat the Notes as indebtedness of the Company for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes and (e) to allocate 100% of the issue price of a Normal Unit to the beneficial interest in the Note and 0.00% of the issue price to the Purchase Contract.

U.S. Bank National Association, as Purchase Contract Agent Dated: By: ------------------ ---------------------------------------- Authorized Officer A-5
(Form of Reverse of Normal Units Certificate) Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2004 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Purchase Contract Agent"), to which Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Normal Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. All defined terms used but not defined in this Certificate have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $25 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of Ordinary Shares of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate or, if the Company has fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Fixed Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or a Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement with respect to the Unit of which such Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $93.99 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 0.2660 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $75.19, the number of Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or less than $75.19, 0.3325 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional Ordinary Shares will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per Ordinary Share on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date or, in the event of a Cash Merger, the Cash Merger Date. The "Closing Price" of the Ordinary Shares on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Ordinary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Ordinary Shares are not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Ordinary Shares are so listed, or if the Ordinary Shares are not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, or, if the Ordinary Shares are not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Ordinary Shares in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Ordinary Shares on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A-6
A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Ordinary Shares (A) are not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) have traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Ordinary Shares at the close of business on such day. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby may be settled prior to the Stock Purchase Date through Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby (i) by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement; (ii) if the Holder has elected not to participate in the remarketing described in Section 2.19 of the Supplemental Indenture, by application of the cash payment delivered in respect thereof deposited by such Holder in respect of such Purchase Contract in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5.4(b)(iv) of the Purchase Contract Agreement or (iii) if a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the successful remarketing of the Notes as contemplated by Section 5.4 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Consideration purchased by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Ordinary Shares in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares to be purchased thereunder or become entitled to exercise its rights as a secured party in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. If, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Last Failed Remarketing the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, exercises its rights as a secured creditor with respect to the Pledged Notes related to this Normal Units Certificate, any accrued and unpaid interest on such Pledged Notes will become payable by the Company to the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate in the manner provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes, but only to the extent instructed by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon the solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Holders of Normal Units a notice (a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each such Holder on the record date set by the Purchase Contract Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Purchase Contract Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes constituting a part of such Holder's Normal Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of any Holder of Normal Units on such record date, the Purchase Contract Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request the maximum number of Pledged Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder A-7
of a Normal Unit, the Purchase Contract Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Note evidenced by such Normal Unit. The Normal Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Normal Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Normal Units Certificate will be registered and Normal Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Normal Units Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange of a Normal Units Certificate, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than exchanges not involving any transfer as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Holder of a Normal Unit may substitute for the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration securing its obligations under the related Purchase Contract Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Unit for which such Pledged Treasury Securities secures the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Stripped Unit." A Holder that elects to substitute Treasury Securities for Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, thereby creating Stripped Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Normal Unit remains in effect, such Normal Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Normal Units in respect of the Pledged Note or Pledged Treasury Consideration and Purchase Contract comprising such Normal Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Normal Unit. A Holder of Stripped Units may reestablish Normal Units at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date by depositing with the Collateral Agent the Notes or the Treasury Consideration in exchange for the release of the Pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Normal Units Certificates) evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered on the Normal Units Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date. The Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in The City of New York or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address appears on the Normal Units Register or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person in writing. The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Purchase Contract Agent A-8
written notice of its election to defer each such Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 6.50% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Stock Purchase Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments) will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Senior Indebtedness in the manner and to the extent set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Stock Purchase Date, the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate will receive on the Stock Purchase Date, in lieu of a cash payment, a number of Ordinary Shares (in addition to the number of Ordinary Shares equal to the Settlement Rate) equal to (i) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate divided by (ii) the Applicable Market Value. In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the date on which the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the Company to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Ordinary Shares other than (i) repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of Ordinary Shares of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its rights to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of any series of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in any series of the Company's Capital Stock (or rights to acquire the Company's Capital Stock) or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of the Company's Capital Stock in exchange for or out of the net cash proceeds of the sale of the Company's Capital Stock (or securities convertible A-9
into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's Capital Stock); or (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan on the date the Company exercises its right to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights pursuant thereto. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive accumulated Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments and the obligations of the Holders to purchase Ordinary Shares, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Normal Units Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement. Upon registration of transfer of this Normal Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Normal Units Certificate and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. The Holder of this Normal Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Normal Units evidenced hereby on his behalf as his attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company, any receiver, liquidator or person or entity performing similar functions or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or federal or other law, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on such Holder's behalf as attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Notes or the Treasury Consideration underlying this Normal Units Certificate pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, PROVIDED, that, upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Notes may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect of the Pledged Notes or the Pledged Treasury Consideration to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase Ordinary Shares under the Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract A-10
and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. The obligations of each Holder to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and except to the extent paid by Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such payments and the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any Ordinary Shares in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder of the related Unit unless the Company shall have (i) received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares to be purchased thereunder by such Holder in the manner herein set forth or (ii) exercised its rights as a secured party under Section 5.4(b)(iii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Company and each Holder of a Normal Unit, by its acceptance thereof, covenants and agrees (a) to treat a Holder's acquisition of the Normal Unit as the acquisition of the Note and Purchase Contract constituting the Normal Unit, (b) to treat each Holder as the owner, for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes of the related Notes or the Treasury Consideration, (d) to treat the Notes as indebtedness of the Company for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes and (d) to allocate 100% of the issue price of a Normal Unit to the beneficial interest in the Note and 0.00% of the issue price to the Purchase Contract. Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding Purchase Contracts. The Purchase Contracts shall for all purposes be governed by, deemed to be a contract under, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Normal Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Normal Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving quarterly payments of interest on the Notes or the Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, such Affiliates nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Each Stripped Unit represents (i) a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Treasury Security or, in the case of an Opt-Out, the Cash Consideration, subject to the Pledge of such interest in such Treasury Security or Cash Consideration, as the case may be, by such Holder pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (ii) the rights and obligations of the Holder under one Purchase Contract with XL Capital Ltd, a Cayman Islands exempted limited company (the "Company"). Each Stripped Unit will have a stated amount of $25 (the "Stated Amount"). In the event a Holder creates a Stripped Unit as a result of an Opt-Out pursuant to Section 5.4(b)(iv) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, all references herein to Treasury Securities or Pledged Treasury Securities, including for purposes of Sections 3.15 and 5.8 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, shall be deemed to include the Cash Consideration in addition to the Treasury Securities. All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement have the meaning set forth therein. Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Treasury Security constituting part of each Stripped Unit evidenced hereby has been pledged to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligations of the Holder under the Purchase Contract comprising a part of such Stripped Unit to purchase Ordinary Shares of the Company. Prior to the purchase of Ordinary Shares under each Purchase Contract, such Purchase Contracts shall not entitle the Holders of Normal Units Certificates to any of the rights of a holder of Ordinary Shares, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of the meetings of shareholders, or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter or any other rights whatsoever as shareholder of the Company. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on May 15, 2007 (the "Stock Purchase Date"), at a price equal to $25 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.01 per share ("Ordinary Shares"), of the Company, equal to the Settlement Rate or, if the Company has fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Fixed Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement with respect to the Stripped Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part, all as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof. The Purchase Price (as defined herein) for the Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract B-2
evidenced hereby, if not paid earlier, shall be paid on the Stock Purchase Date by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities pledged to secure the obligations of the Holder under such Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement. The Company shall pay on each Payment Date in respect of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Stripped Unit evidenced hereby an amount (the "Contract Adjustment Payments") equal to 3.97% per year of the Stated Amount through but excluding the Stock Purchase Date, computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, subject to deferral at the option of the Company as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof (provided that if on any date on which Contract Adjustment Payments are to be made on the Purchase Contracts is not a Business Day, then payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, and no interest or payment will be paid in respect of the delay, except that if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day). Such Contract Adjustment Payments shall be payable to the Person in whose name this Stripped Units Certificate (or a Predecessor Stripped Units Certificate) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in the City of New York or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address appears on the Stripped Units Register or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person in writing.

Dated: ----------------- U.S. Bank National Association, as Purchase Contract Agent By: ------------------------------------ Authorized Officer B-5
(Form of Reverse of Stripped Units Certificate) Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2004 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Purchase Contract Agent"), to which the Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Stripped Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. All defined terms used but not defined in this Certificate have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $25 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of Ordinary Shares of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate or, if the Company has fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Fixed Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement with respect to the Unit of which such Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $93.99 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 0.2660 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $75.19, the number of Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or less than $75.19, 0.3325 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional Ordinary Shares will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per Ordinary Share on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date or in the event of a Cash Merger, the Cash Merger Date. The "Closing Price" of the Ordinary Shares on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Ordinary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Ordinary Shares are not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Ordinary Shares are so listed, or if the Ordinary Shares are not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, or, if the Ordinary Shares are not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Ordinary Shares in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Ordinary Shares on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. B-6
A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Ordinary Shares (A) are not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) have traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Ordinary Shares at the close of business of such day. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby may be settled prior to the Stock Purchase Date through Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby (i) by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement or (ii) by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying the Stripped Units represented by this Stripped Units Certificate. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Ordinary Shares in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. The Stripped Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Stripped Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Stripped Units Certificate will be registered and Stripped Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Stripped Units Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange of a Stripped Units Certificate, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than exchanges not involving any transfer as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Holder of a Stripped Unit may substitute for the Pledged Treasury Securities securing its obligations under the related Purchase Contract Notes or the Treasury Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Unit for which such Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration secures the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Normal Unit." A Holder that elects to substitute Notes or the Treasury Consideration for Pledged Treasury Securities, thereby reestablishing Normal Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Stripped Unit remains in effect, such Stripped Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Stripped Unit in respect of the Pledged Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract comprising such Stripped Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Stripped Unit. B-7
A Holder of Normal Units may establish Stripped Units at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date by depositing with the Collateral Agent Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of the Pledged Notes or the Pledged Treasury Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Stripped Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Stripped Units Certificates) evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered on the Stripped Units Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, or, if the Units do not remain in book-entry only form, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Stripped Units Register or by wire transfer to the account maintained in the United States designated by written notice given ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date by such Person. The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Purchase Contract Agent written notice of its election to defer each such Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 6.50% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Stock Purchase Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Stock Purchase Date, the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate will receive on the Stock Purchase Date, in lieu of a cash payment, a number of Ordinary Shares (in addition to the number of Ordinary Shares equal to the Settlement Rate) equal to (i) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate divided by (ii) the Applicable Market Value. B-8
The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments) will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Senior Indebtedness in the manner and to the extent set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the date on which the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the Company to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Ordinary Shares other than (i) repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of Ordinary Shares of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its rights to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of any series of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in any series of the Company's Capital Stock (or rights to acquire the Company's Capital Stock) or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of the Company's Capital Stock in exchange for or out of the net cash proceeds of the sale of the Company's Capital Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's Capital Stock); or (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan on the date the Company exercises its right to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights pursuant thereto. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive accumulated Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, and the obligations of the Holders to purchase Ordinary Shares, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two business days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Stripped Units Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Treasury Securities from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement. Upon registration of transfer of this Stripped Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase B-9

The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by his acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. The Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Stripped Units evidenced hereby on his behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company, any receiver, liquidator or person or entity performing similar functions or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or federal or other law, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on such Holder's behalf as attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Treasury Securities underlying this Stripped Units Certificate pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, PROVIDED that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Stripped Units may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities, to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase Ordinary Shares under the Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. The obligations of each Holder to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and except to the extent paid by Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such payments and the Purchase Price. Each Holder of any Unit, and each Beneficial Owner thereof, by its acceptance thereof or of its interest therein, further agrees to treat (i) the formation of Stripped Units as the acquisition of a Unit consisting of the Purchase Contract and the Treasury Securities and (ii) itself as the owner of the related Notes, Treasury Consideration or Treasury Securities, as the case may be. Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts. The Purchase Contracts shall for all purposes be governed by and deemed to be a contract under, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Stripped Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Stripped Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving any Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the B-10
contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, such Affiliate, nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of Ordinary Shares. A copy of the Purchase Contract Agreement is available for inspection at the offices of the Purchase Contract Agent. B-11

(v) all Proceeds of the foregoing; and (vi) all powers and rights now owned or hereafter acquired under or with respect to any of the foregoing (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "COLLATERAL"). (b) Prior to or concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent, on behalf of the initial Holders of the Units, shall cause the Notes comprising a part of the Normal Units, which will be subject to the Pledge set forth in this Section 2.1, to be Transferred to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company. (c) The pledge provided in this Section 2.1 is herein referred to as the "Pledge" and the Notes (including any Notes that are delivered pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof), Treasury Consideration and Treasury Securities subject to the Pledge, excluding any Notes, Treasury Consideration or Treasury Securities released from the Pledge as provided in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 hereof, respectively, are hereinafter referred to as "Pledged Notes," "Pledged Treasury Consideration" and "Pledged Treasury Securities," respectively. Subject to the Pledge and the provisions of Section 2.2 hereof, the Holders from time to time shall have full beneficial ownership of the Collateral. For purposes of perfecting the Pledge under applicable law, including, to the extent applicable, the TRADES Regulations or the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted and in effect in any applicable jurisdiction, the Collateral Agent shall be the agent of the Company as provided herein. Whenever directed by the Collateral Agent acting on behalf of the Company, the Securities Intermediary shall have the right to reregister in its name the Notes or any other securities held in physical form. (d) Except as may be required in order to release Notes or Treasury Consideration, as applicable, in connection with a Special Event Redemption or with a Holder's election to convert its investment from a Normal Unit to a Stripped Unit, or except as may be required in order to release Treasury Securities in connection with a Holder's election to convert its investment from a Stripped Unit to a Normal Unit, or except as otherwise required to release Notes, Treasury Consideration or Treasury Securities as specified herein, the Collateral Agent, shall not relinquish physical possession of any certificate evidencing Notes, Treasury Securities or Treasury Consideration, as applicable, prior to the termination of this Agreement. If it becomes necessary for the Collateral Agent to relinquish physical possession of a certificate in order to release a portion of the Notes evidenced thereby from the Pledge, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to arrange for the Securities Intermediary to obtain physical possession of a replacement certificate evidencing any Notes remaining subject to the Pledge hereunder registered to the Securities Intermediary or endorsed in blank (or accompanied by a bond power endorsed in blank) within fifteen calendar days of the date the Securities Intermediary relinquished possession. The Securities Intermediary shall promptly notify the Company and the Collateral Agent of its inability to obtain possession of any such replacement certificate as required hereby. (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for avoidance of doubt, (i) the cash payments at the rate of 2.53% per year of the Stated Amount of the Notes and (ii) after a Special Event Redemption, the quarterly payments with respect to the Treasury Consideration (as specified in clause (B) of the definition of Treasury Consideration) that are a 5
part of the Normal Units to Holders of Normal Units shall not be subject to the Pledge and therefore are not part of the Collateral. SECTION 2.2 DELIVERY, CONTROL AND PERFECTION. (a) The Purchase Contract Agent shall immediately deliver to the Collateral Agent all certificates or instruments representing the Collateral accompanied by stock or bond powers duly executed in blank or other instruments of reasonable satisfaction to the Collateral Agent.

In connection with the Pledge granted in Section 2.1, and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Holders from time to time acting through the Purchase Contract Agent, as their attorney-in-fact, hereby authorize and direct the Securities Intermediary (without the necessity of obtaining the further consent of the Purchase Contract Agent or any of the Holders), and the Securities Intermediary agrees, to comply with and follow any instructions and entitlement orders (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the Code) that the Collateral Agent may deliver pursuant to the terms hereof or upon the written direction of the Company with respect to the Collateral Account, the Collateral credited thereto and any Security Entitlements with respect thereto. Such instructions and entitlement orders may, without limitation, direct the Securities Intermediary to transfer, redeem, assign, or otherwise deliver the Notes, the Treasury Consideration and the Treasury Securities, and any Security Entitlements with respect thereto, or sell, liquidate or dispose of such assets through a broker designated by the Company, and to pay and deliver any income, proceeds or other funds derived therefrom to the Company. The Collateral Agent shall be the agent of the Company and shall act only in accordance with the terms hereof or as otherwise directed in writing by the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall issue entitlement orders to the Securities Intermediary when and as required by the terms hereof or as otherwise directed in writing by the Company. (c) The Securities Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees that: (i) all securities or other property underlying any financial assets credited to the Collateral Account shall be registered in the name of the Securities Intermediary, or its nominee, endorsed to the Securities Intermediary, or its nominee, or in blank or credited to another Collateral Account maintained in the name of the Securities Intermediary and in no case will any financial asset credited to the Collateral Account be registered in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Company or any Holder, payable to the order of, or specially indorsed to, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Company or any Holder except to the extent the foregoing have been specially endorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank; (ii) all property delivered to the Securities Intermediary pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any Notes, Treasury Consideration or Treasury Securities) will be promptly credited to the Collateral Account; 6
(iii) the Collateral Account is an account to which financial assets are or may be credited, and the Securities Intermediary shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement, treat the Purchase Contract Agent as entitled to exercise the rights of any financial asset credited to the Collateral Account; (iv) the Securities Intermediary has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with any other Person relating to the Collateral Account and/or any financial assets credited thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with entitlement orders (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the Code) of such other Person; and (v) the Securities Intermediary has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with the Company, the Collateral Agent or the Purchase Contract Agent purporting to limit or condition the obligation of the Securities Intermediary to comply with entitlement orders as set forth in this Section 2.2 hereof. (d) The Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that each item of property (whether investment property, financial asset, security, instrument or cash) credited to the Collateral Account shall be treated as a "financial asset" within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the Code. (e) In the event of any conflict between this Agreement (or any portion thereof) and any other agreement now existing or hereafter entered into, the terms of this Agreement, as may be amended pursuant to Article IX hereof, shall prevail. (f) The Purchase Contract Agent hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent and the Company, with full power of substitution, as the Purchase Contract Agent's attorney-in-fact to take on behalf of, and in the name, place and stead of the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders, any action necessary or desirable to perfect and to keep perfected the security interest in the Collateral referred to in Section 2.1. The grant of such power-of-attorney shall not be deemed to require of the Collateral Agent any specific duties or obligations not otherwise assumed by the Collateral Agent hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary or the Purchase Contract Agent be responsible for the preparation or filing of any financing or continuation statements in the appropriate jurisdictions or responsible for maintenance or perfection of any security interest hereunder. (g) The Purchase Contract Agent shall file with the United States Internal Revenue Service and deliver to the Holders Forms 1099 (or successor or comparable forms), to the extent required by law, with respect to payments to the Holders. 7

Upon receipt of the proceeds following a successful remarketing, (i) the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, shall thereupon apply such proceeds in an amount equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the related Normal Units in direct settlement and satisfaction in full of such Normal Units Holders' obligations to pay to the Company the Purchase Price under the Purchase Contracts on the Stock Purchase Date and (ii) the remaining portion, if any, of the proceeds of such successful remarketing shall be distributed by the Remarketing Agent to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment on a pro rata basis to such Normal Units Holders participating in such remarketing. (b) The Remarketing Agent shall agree to make one or more attempts to remarket the Notes in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement between the Remarketing Date and the last Subsequent Remarketing Date. If by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date the Remarketing Agent has failed to remarket the Notes at a price equal to 100.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes participating in the remarketing, the "Last Failed Remarketing" shall be deemed to have occurred. In this case, the Remarketing Agent will agree to advise the Collateral Agent in writing that it cannot remarket the related Pledged Notes of such Holders of Normal Units and the Remarketing Agent will agree pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement to return to the Collateral Agent the Notes delivered to it pursuant to Section 4.5(a) within three Business Days of the Last Failed Remarketing. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company will, at the written direction of the Company, deliver or dispose of the Pledged Notes in accordance with the Company's written instructions to satisfy in full, from any such disposition or retention, such Holders' obligations to pay the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares; provided that if upon the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent delivers or disposes of the Pledged Notes in accordance with the written instructions of the Company, any accumulated and unpaid interest on such Notes will become payable by the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holder of the Normal Units to which such Notes relate in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement. (c) In the event a Holder of Stripped Units has not made an Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying its Stripped Units, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the Ordinary Shares to be issued under such Purchase Contracts from the payments received in respect of the related Pledged Treasury Securities. Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder of Stripped Units, the Collateral Agent shall apply such payments to the Company in settlement of such Purchase 12
Contracts on the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to written instructions from the Purchase Contract Agent. In the event the payments received in respect of the related Pledged Treasury Securities are in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchase Contracts being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent shall distribute such excess, when received, to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to such Holders of Stripped Units. (d) Pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement and the Purchase Contract Agreement, on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, but no earlier than the sixteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, holders of Separate Notes may elect to have their Separate Notes remarketed by delivering their Separate Notes, together with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT C hereto, to the Custodial Agent. On the second Business Day immediately prior to the Remarketing Date, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of such Separate Notes to be remarketed. The Custodial Agent will hold such Separate Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account. A holder of Separate Notes electing to have its Separate Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw such election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT D hereto, on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent will return such Separate Notes to such holder. On the Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent at the written direction of the Remarketing Agent will deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all Separate Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to this Section 4.5(d) and not withdrawn pursuant to the terms hereof prior to such date. In the event of a successful remarketing, after deducting as the remarketing fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the Remarketing Value of such Separate Notes, the Remarketing Agent will remit to the Custodial Agent, for the benefit of the holders of such Separate Notes, the portion of the proceeds from such remarketing equal to the amount calculated in respect of such Separate Notes as set forth in Section 5.4(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement. If, despite using reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent advises the Custodial Agent in writing that there has been a Last Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will promptly return such Notes to the Custodial Agent for redelivery to the holders of such Separate Notes. For purposes of this Section 4.5(d), a "holder" of Separate Notes shall mean the Person in whose name such Separate Notes are registered on the books of the registrar for the Notes. ARTICLE V VOTING RIGHTS -- NOTES SECTION 5.1 EXERCISE BY PURCHASE CONTRACT AGENT. The Purchase Contract Agent may exercise, or refrain from exercising, any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement; provided that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not exercise or, as the case may be, shall not refrain from exercising such right if, in the judgment of the Company, such action would impair or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the value of all or any of the Pledged Notes; and provided, further, that the Purchase Contract Agent shall give the Company and the Collateral 13
Agent at least five Business Days' prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or its reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right. Upon receipt of any notices and other communications in respect of any Pledged Notes, including notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to send promptly to the Purchase Contract Agent such notice or communication, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of a written request therefor from the Purchase Contract Agent, execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent such proxies and other instruments in respect of such Pledged Notes (in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent) as are prepared by the Purchase Contract Agent with respect to the Pledged Notes. ARTICLE VI RIGHTS AND REMEDIES; SPECIAL EVENT REDEMPTION SECTION 6.1 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE COLLATERAL AGENT. (a) In addition to the rights and remedies available at law or in equity, after an event of default under any of the Purchase Contracts by a Holder thereof, the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor thereto) as in effect in the State of New York from time to time (the "Code") (whether or not the Code is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted) and the TRADES Regulations and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted. Wherever reference is made in this Agreement to any section of the Code, such reference shall be deemed to include a reference to any provision of the Code which is a successor to, or amendment of, such section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such remedies may include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the direction of the Company (i) retention of the Pledged Notes or other Collateral in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts or (ii) sale of the Pledged Notes or other Collateral in one or more public or private sales or otherwise at the written direction of the Company. (b) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, in the event the Collateral Agent is unable to make payments to the Company on account of any Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Treasury Securities as provided in Article III hereof in full satisfaction of the obligations of the Holder of the Units of which such Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Treasury Securities, as applicable, is a part under the related Purchase Contracts, any such inability to make a payment shall constitute an event of default under the Purchase Contracts and the Collateral Agent shall have and may exercise, with reference to such Pledged Treasury Securities or such Pledged Treasury Consideration, as applicable, and such obligations of such Holder, any and all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Code and the TRADES Regulations after default by a debtor, and as otherwise granted herein or under any other law. (c) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to receive and 14
collect all payments of (i) the principal amount of, or interest on, the Pledged Notes, or (ii) the principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Treasury Securities, subject, in each case, to the provisions of Article III. (d) The Purchase Contract Agent, individually and as attorney-in-fact for each Holder of Units, agrees that, from time to time, upon the written request of the Company or the Collateral Agent (acting upon the written request of the Company), the Purchase Contract Agent or such Holder shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such other acts and things as may be necessary, including as the Company or the Collateral Agent (acting upon the written request of the Company) may reasonably request in order to maintain the Pledge, and the perfection and priority thereof, and to confirm the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder. The Purchase Contract Agent shall have no liability to any Holder for executing any documents or taking any such acts requested by the Company or the Collateral Agent (acting upon the written request of the Company) hereunder, except for liability for its own grossly negligent act, its own grossly negligent failure to act, its own bad faith or its own willful misconduct. SECTION 6.2 SUBSTITUTIONS. Whenever a Holder has the right to substitute Treasury Securities, Notes, or Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, for Collateral held by the Collateral Agent, such substitution shall not constitute a novation of the security interest created hereby. SECTION 6.3 SPECIAL EVENT REDEMPTION. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption prior to the Stock Purchase Date and the receipt of the Redemption Price of the Pledged Notes by the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent will, at the written direction of the Company, apply the Redemption Price to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Normal Units the Treasury Portfolio. The Collateral Agent shall Transfer the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Account to secure the obligation of all Holders of Normal Units to purchase Ordinary Shares of the Company under the Purchase Contracts constituting a part of such Normal Units, in substitution for the Pledged Notes. Thereafter, the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as it had in respect of the Pledged Notes as provided in Articles II, III, IV, V and VI, and any reference herein to the Notes shall be deemed to be reference to such Treasury Portfolio, and any reference herein to interest on the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Treasury Portfolio. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption and the satisfaction of all terms and conditions related thereto as forth in the Indenture, including receipt of the Redemption Price, the Collateral Agent shall be authorized to surrender the Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. SECTION 6.4 CASH RECEIVED FROM HOLDERS OF NORMAL UNITS NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE REMARKETING. If a Holder of Normal Units shall opt not to participate in the remarketing in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement and upon the receipt by the Collateral Agent of the Cash Consideration paid by such Holder sufficient to satisfy the Holder's obligations to the Company under the related Purchase Contracts in full, the Collateral Agent shall transfer such Cash Consideration to the Collateral Account to secure and be applied in direct settlement and satisfaction in full of the obligations of such Holder to purchase Ordinary Shares of the 15
Company under the Purchase Contracts constituting a part of such Normal Units. Thereupon, the Collateral Agent shall deliver the related Pledged Notes to the Purchase Contract Agent on the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Remarketing Period, free and clear of any lien, claim and security interest created hereby. Thereafter, such Units will be Stripped Units and the Collateral Agent shall have a first priority perfected security interest in such Cash Consideration paid by such Holder. In such event, all references in this Agreement, including for purposes of Section 4.3, to the Treasury Securities or Pledged Treasury Securities shall be deemed to include such Cash Consideration (the Cash Consideration subject to the Pledge referred to as the "Pledged Cash Consideration") or Pledged Cash Consideration, as the case may be, in addition to the Treasury Securities or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, with respect to the applicable Units.

any mortgage, charge, pledge, indenture, contract or undertaking to which it is a party or which is binding on it or any of its assets.

SECTION 8.3 RELIANCE. Each of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent and the Collateral Agent, in absence of bad faith, shall be entitled conclusively to rely upon any certification, order, judgment, instructions, opinion, notice or other communication (including, without limitation, any thereof by telephone or facsimile) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons (without being required to determine the correctness of any fact stated therein), and upon advice and written statements of legal counsel and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be.

SECTION 8.6 COMPENSATION AND INDEMNITY. The Company agrees: (a) to pay each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary from time to time such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, for all services rendered by each of them hereunder; and (b) to indemnify the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and their officers, directors and agents for, and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its powers and duties under this Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel) of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of such powers and duties or collecting such amounts. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall each promptly notify the Company of any third party claim which may give rise to the indemnity hereunder and give the Company the opportunity to control the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, provided no conflict of interest exists (if such a conflict of interests exists, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary will be entitled to one separate counsel payable by the Company), and if the Company so elects to assume such defense, the Company shall in good faith defend the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary (in which case all attorney's fees and expenses shall be borne by the Company). No compromise or settlement of any claims may be effected by any party without the other parties' consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless (i) there is no finding or omission of any violation of law and no effect on any other claims that may be made against any of such other parties and (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the party seeking the compromise or settlement. The provisions of this Section 8.6(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary. SECTION 8.7 FAILURE TO ACT. In the event of any ambiguity in the provisions of this Agreement or any dispute between or conflicting claims by or among the parties hereto or any other Person with respect to any funds or property deposited hereunder, the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled, after prompt notice to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, at its sole option, to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or instructions with respect to such property or funds so long as such dispute or conflict shall continue, and neither the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent nor the Securities Intermediary shall be or become liable in any way to any of the parties hereto for its failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting claims, demands or instructions. The Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled to refuse to act until either (i) such conflicting or adverse claims or demands shall have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or settled by agreement between the conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing, reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, or (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, 21
as the case may be, shall have received security or an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, sufficient to save the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, harmless from and against any and all loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense which the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may incur by reason of its acting without bad faith, willful misconduct or negligence. The Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may, but shall not be required, in addition elect to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or orders at the expense of the Company as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may deem necessary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent nor the Securities Intermediary shall be required to take any action that is in the reasonable opinion of its counsel contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, or which would in its reasonable opinion subject it or any of its officers, employees or directors to liability. SECTION 8.8 RESIGNATION; REPLACEMENT OF COLLATERAL AGENT, CUSTODIAL AGENT OR SECURITIES INTERMEDIARY. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as provided below, (a) the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact for the Holders of Units, (b) the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may be removed at any time by the Company (with or without cause) by notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and (c) if the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder in any material respect for a period of not less than 20 days after receiving written notice of such failure by the Purchase Contract Agent and such failure shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may be removed by the Purchase Contract Agent. The Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence. Upon notice of any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after any notice of such resignation or such removal, then the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may at the Company's expense petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. Upon removal of the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, no fees paid to the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary pursuant to Section 8.6(a) of this Agreement shall be refunded. Each successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be a bank which has an office or agency in New York, New York with a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or any affiliate of a bank holding company having such capital and surplus. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, such successor shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, upon payment of any of its 22
unpaid fees and expenses, shall take all appropriate action to transfer any money and property held by it hereunder (including the Collateral) to such successor. The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Section 8.8, and Section 8.6 hereof, shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent hereunder shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary hereunder. So long as it meets the requirements of this Section 8.8, any corporation into which the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, in its individual capacity, may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Collateral Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Collateral Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, respectively, under this Agreement without further act.

Without limiting the foregoing, the above choice of law is expressly agreed to by the Securities Intermediary, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Holders from time to time acting through the Purchase Contract Agent, as their attorney-in-fact, in connection with the establishment and maintenance of the Collateral Account, which law, for purposes of the Code, shall be deemed to be the law governing all Security Entitlements related thereto. In addition, such parties agree that, for purposes of the Code, New York shall be the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction. The Company, the Collateral Agent and the Holders from time to time of the Units, acting through the Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact, hereby submit to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City for the purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company, the Collateral Agent and the Holders from time to time of the Units, acting through the Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact, irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

If for any reason CT Corporation System (or any successor agent for this purpose) shall cease to act as agent for service of process as provided above, the Company will promptly appoint a successor agent for this purpose reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent. The Company agrees to take any and all actions as may be necessary to maintain such designation and appointment of such agent in full force and effect. SECTION 10.3 JUDGMENT CURRENCY. The Company agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that (a) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Purchase Contract Agent could purchase in The City of New York the requisite amount of the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the New York Banking Day preceding the day on which a final unappealable judgment is given and (b) its obligations under this Agreement to make payments in the Required Currency (i) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, or 26
any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with clause (a)), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments, (ii) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable and (iii) shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sum due under this Agreement.

(c) The representations and warranties of the Company contained herein shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Remarketing Date, and the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have performed in all material respects all covenants and agreements contained herein or in the Purchase Contract Agreement or Pledge Agreement to be performed on their part at or prior to the Remarketing Date.

Section 10, Section 11, Section 12 and Section 14 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent. Section 10. REMARKETING AGENT'S PERFORMANCE; DUTY OF CARE. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transactions Documents. In the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it which purports to conform to the requirements hereunder as to the truth of the statements expressed therein. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to be signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent shall not have any obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate on the Remarketed Notes or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Remarketed Notes, and it shall rely solely upon timely written notice from the Company pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate. The Remarketing Agent shall not incur any liability under this Agreement to any beneficial owner or holder of Remarketed Notes, or other securities, either in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, for any action or failure to act in connection with the remarketing of the Remarketed 13
Notes or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that such liability has, by final judicial determination, resulted from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of the Remarketing Agent or from its failure to fulfill its express obligations hereunder. The provisions of this Section 10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall also continue to apply to every Remarketing Agent notwithstanding its resignation or removal. The Remarketing Agent will act as the agent of the Holders. Section 11. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Remarketing Agent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for any legal expenses of one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) engaged reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein. (b) The Remarketing Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus supplement, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided that in no case will the Remarketing Agent be liable or 14
responsible for any amount in excess of the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 4. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to subsection (a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Remarketing Agent. In case any such action shall be brought against the indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation (as set forth below). Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 11 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each 15
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. Section 12. CONTRIBUTION. (a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 11 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 11(a) or 11(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other from the offering of the Remarketed Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds of the Remarketed Notes less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the one hand and the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the other hand bear to the total net proceeds of the Remarketed Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
