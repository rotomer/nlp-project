Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On September 22, 2004, XL Capital Ltd, a Cayman Islands exempted limited company (the "Company") entered into a First Supplemental Indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture") to the Indenture, dated as of May 23, 2001 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, relating to the issuance of the Company's Zero-Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2021 (the "Debentures"). The Indenture provides holders of the Debentures with the right, under certain circumstances, to require the Company to purchase the Debentures (i) upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Indenture) and (ii) on certain specified dates. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company had the right to elect to pay the purchase price payable upon exercise of such put rights in cash or the Company's ordinary shares, or, in the case of the put right described clause (ii) above, a combination thereof. Pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Indenture, the Company has surrendered the right to elect to pay such amounts in ordinary shares and will instead pay such amounts, if required, in cash. Payment of such amounts in cash is consistent with the Company's previously disclosed intentions. The Supplemental Indenture does not affect the Company's obligation to deliver ordinary shares upon conversion of the Debentures should they become convertible. A copy of the Supplemental Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated by reference herein. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits.

(i) the information required by Section 3.8(b); and (ii) whether the Company desires the Trustee to give the Change in Control Notice required by Section 3.8(b).
