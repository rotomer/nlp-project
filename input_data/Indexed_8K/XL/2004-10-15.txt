Scotton Investor Relations Media Relations (441) 294 7201 (441) 294 7165 XL CAPITAL LTD ANNOUNCES ESTIMATED IMPACT ON THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM RECENT STORMS Hamilton, Bermuda - October 14, 2004: XL Capital Ltd (NYSE:XL) ("XL" or the "Company") announced today that, based on revised loss reports and estimates, it expects net claims arising from storm activity during the third quarter, 2004 of approximately $450 million. This amount includes revised estimates for expected net claims related to Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Ivan of approximately $120 million, $80 million and $160 million, respectively and includes estimated net claims of approximately $90 million related to Hurricane Jeanne. Net claims related to recent storms in the Pacific were not significant. Of the $450 million in total expected net claims, approximately $260 million is expected to be attributable to the Company's reinsurance segment with the balance of approximately $190 million attributable to the Company's insurance segment. As a result of these estimated claims, the Company expects to record a charge of approximately $420 million after tax, which will adversely affect its third quarter and full year results but will not materially affect its overall financial condition.

A conference call to discuss the Company's third quarter results will be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time on Tuesday, November 2, 2004.
