Underwriters of such Debt Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Debt Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Debt Securities.

A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2.

The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Debt Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Debt Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Debt Securities are, at and as of the Time of Delivery for such Designated Debt Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to such Designated Debt Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Debt Securities; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction; (b) Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions and letter, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex II-1 and Annex II-2, respectively, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, United States counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions and letter, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex III-1 and Annex III-2, respectively; (d) Appleby Spurling Hunter, Cayman Islands counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex IV; (e) Charles F. Barr, Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his written opinion or opinions, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, in the form attached hereto in Annex V; 12
(f) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Debt Securities and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Debt Securities, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company who have certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives; (g) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Debt Securities any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Debt Securities, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Debt Securities, there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than changes resulting from the exercise of options or the conversion of warrants or capital stock which were outstanding as of such date, or from the exercise of options granted after such date in the ordinary course of business or from repurchases of capital stock) or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Debt Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Debt Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Debt Securities; (h) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Debt Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) other than any announcements made prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement, no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability; (i) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Debt Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange (the 13
"Exchange"); (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda declared by the relevant authority or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda or the declaration by the United States, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives is so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Debt Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Debt Securities; (v) a change or development involving a prospective change in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda taxation affecting the Company, the Designated Debt Securities or the transfer thereof or the imposition of exchange controls by the United States, Bermuda or the Cayman Islands or (vi) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or currency exchange rates or controls in the United States, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (vi) in the judgment of the Representatives is so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Debt Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Debt Securities; (j) The Designated Debt Securities at the Time of Delivery shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the exchange, if any, set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Debt Securities; (k) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Debt Securities; (l) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Debt Securities certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) relating to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and no stop orders, the matters set forth in subsections (g) and (h) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request; and (m) Prior to the Time of Delivery, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under 14
the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Debt Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal expenses of one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) engaged reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Debt Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Debt Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Debt Securities. (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Debt Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Debt Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel (in addition to any applicable local counsel). (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party 15
similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation (except as set forth below). Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Debt Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Debt Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Debt Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the 16
Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by PRO RATA allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Debt Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Debt Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Debt Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Debt Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Debt Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties satisfactory to the Company to purchase such Designated Debt Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Debt Securities then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Debt Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Debt Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Debt Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Debt Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever 17
changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Debt Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Debt Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Debt Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Debt Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Debt Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Debt Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Debt Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Debt Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Debt Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Debt Securities to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Debt Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Debt Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Debt Securities. 11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Debt Securities with respect to which such Pricing Agreement shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 6, 8 and 19 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Designated Debt Securities are not delivered 18
by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Debt Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Debt Securities except as provided in Sections 6, 8 and 19 hereof. 12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Debt Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its principal address, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon written request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Debt Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. The Company irrevocably (i) agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding against the Company brought by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter arising out of or based upon this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and (iii) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. The Company has appointed CT Corporation System, New York, New York, as its authorized agent (the "Authorized Agent") upon whom process may be served in any such action arising out of or based on this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby which may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter, expressly consents to the jurisdiction of any such court in respect of any such action, and waives any other requirements of or objections to 19
personal jurisdiction with respect thereto. Such appointment shall be irrevocable. The Company represents and warrants that the Authorized Agent has agreed to act as such agent for service of process and agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents and instruments, that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect as aforesaid. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent and written notice of such service to the Company shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon the Company. 15. Time shall be of the essence in each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 16. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 18. The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. 19. In respect of any judgment or order given or made for any amount due hereunder or under any Pricing Agreement that is expressed and paid in a currency (the "judgment currency") other than United States dollars, the Company will indemnify each Underwriter against any loss incurred by such Underwriter as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the United States dollar amount is converted into the judgment currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and (ii) the rate of exchange at which an Underwriter is able to purchase United States dollars with the amount of judgment currency actually received by such Underwriter. The foregoing indemnity shall constitute a separate and independent obligation of the Company and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order aforesaid. The term "rate of exchange" shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into United States dollars.

(b) If a Tax Event occurs and is continuing, the Company may, at its option, redeem the 2024 Securities in whole, but not in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Securities, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date and Additional Amounts, if any, then due or that will become due on the date fixed for redemption as a result of such redemption. Installments of interest on 2024 Securities which are due and payable on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable to Holders of the 2024 Securities registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record dates. (c) (i) Notwithstanding Section 11.04 of the Base Indenture, any notice of redemption pursuant to Section 3.9(a) or (b) shall (i) be sufficient if instead of setting forth a specific price with respect to the Redemption Price, it sets forth the manner of calculation thereof and (ii) be mailed to the Holders not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case of a Tax Event redemption, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the payor would be obliged to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of 2024 Securities by it were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of 2024 Securities pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Paying Agent (a) an Officers' Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that any factual conditions precedent to the Company's right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) a legal opinion of an outside nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that the circumstances referred to in this clause (ii) and the circumstances described in the definition of "Tax Event" exist. -6-

Section 3.13. Covenants. The 2024 Securities shall be entitled to the benefit of each of the covenants in Article Ten of the Base Indenture and the following additional covenants (each of which shall be deemed to be a provision of the Indenture and, when referred to as a provision of the Indenture, shall be identified by reference to the Section number that is set forth immediately preceding the covenant): (a) SECTION 10.09. LIMITATION ON LIENS ON STOCK OF DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARIES. The Company covenants that, so long as any 2024 Securities are outstanding, the Company will not, nor will the Company permit any Designated Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur, guarantee or otherwise permit to exist any indebtedness evidenced by notes, debentures, bonds or similar instruments that is secured by any mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest or other encumbrance upon any shares of Capital Stock of any Designated Subsidiary (whether such shares of stock are now owned or hereafter acquired) without effectively providing concurrently that the 2024 Securities will be secured equally and ratably with such indebtedness for at least the time period such other indebtedness is so secured. (b) SECTION 10.10. ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS. All amounts payable (whether in respect of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of the 2024 Securities will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Cayman Islands or Bermuda or any political subdivision thereof or any authority or agency therein or thereof having power to tax, unless the withholding or deduction of such taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges is required by law. In that event, the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts receivable by a Holder after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction on such payment of additional amounts) shall equal the respective amounts that would have been receivable by such Holder had no such withholding or deduction been required ("ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS"), except that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable in relation to any payment (including a payment made in connection with a redemption) in respect of any of the 2024 Securities (a) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Person who would be able to avoid such withholding or deduction by complying with such Person's statutory requirements or by making a declaration of non-residence or similar claim for exemption but, in either case, fails to do so, or is liable for such taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges in respect of such 2024 Security by reason of his having some connection with (including, without limitation, being a citizen of, being incorporated or engaged in a trade or business in, or having a residence or principal place of business or other presence in) the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, as the case may be, other than (i) the mere holding of such 2024 Security; (ii) the receipt of principal, interest or other amount in respect of such 2024 Security; or (iii) the mere enforcement of rights with respect to such 2024 Security; (b) presented for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date, except to the extent that the relevant Holder would -8-
have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting the same for payment on or before the expiration of such period of 30 days; (c) to a fiduciary, a partnership or person who is not the beneficial owner of a 2024 Security, if and to the extent that, as a result of an applicable tax treaty, no Additional Amounts would have been payable had the beneficiary, partner or beneficial owner owned the 2024 Security directly; (d) on account of any inheritance, gift, estate, personal property, stamp, sales or transfer or similar taxes, duties, levies, assessments or similar governmental charges; or (e) on account of any taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges that are payable otherwise than by withholding from payments in respect of such 2024 Security. In the event that payments in respect of the 2024 Securities are subject to withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes, the Company will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Company will used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any taxes so deducted or withheld from each relevant taxing jurisdiction imposing such taxes and will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide or make available such certified copies to each Holder. If the Company becomes subject generally at any time to any taxing jurisdiction other than or in addition to the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, or makes a payment on the 2024 Securities from any jurisdiction other than or in addition to the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, references in this Section 10.10 to the Cayman Islands and Bermuda shall be read and construed as references to such other jurisdiction(s) and/or to the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Any reference in the Indenture to principal, premium or interest in respect of the 2024 Securities, any redemption amount and any other amounts in the nature of principal shall be deemed also to refer to any Additional Amounts that may be payable under the Indenture, and the express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provision hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to the Indenture, if the 2024 Securities require the payment of Additional Amounts, at least 30 days prior to each date on which any payments under or with respect to the 2024 Securities are due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter) the Company or its designee shall furnish to the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent an Officers' Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable, and any other information to enable the Trustee or such Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the payment date. The Company will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of any 2024 Securities or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the 2024 Securities), or the -9-
receipt of any payments with respect to the 2024 Securities, excluding any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands or Bermuda in which a Paying Agent is located, other than those resulting from, or required to be paid in connection with, the enforcement of the 2024 Securities, the Indenture or any other such document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the 2024 Securities.

The Company and the Trustee irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Company hereby designates and appoints CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, as its authorized agent upon which process may be served in any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Indenture which may be instituted in any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, and agrees that service of process upon such agent, and written notice of said service to the Company by the Person serving the same, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Company in any such suit, action or proceeding and further designates its domicile, the domicile of CT Corporation System specified above and any domicile CT Corporation System may have in the future as its domicile to receive any notice hereunder (including service of process). If for any reason CT Corporation System (or any successor agent for this purpose) shall cease to act as agent for service of process as provided above, the -11-
Company will promptly appoint a successor agent for this purpose reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. The Company agrees to take any and all actions as may be necessary to maintain such designation and appointment of such agent in full force and effect.

For purpose of the foregoing, "NEW YORK BANKING DAY" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to be closed.

[FORM OF REVERSE] This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company designated as its "6.375% Senior Notes due 2024" (herein sometimes referred to as the "NOTES"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $350,000,000, issued under and pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of June 2, 2004 (the "BASE INDENTURE"), duly executed and delivered, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "TRUSTEE"), and a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 12, 2004 (the "SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE"), between the Company and the Trustee (such Base Indenture as amended and supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, the "INDENTURE"), to which Indenture and all subsequent indentures supplemental thereto relating to the Notes reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series so issued are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. The Notes will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date plus the greater of: (A) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, and (B) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. If a Tax Event occurs and is continuing, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date and Additional Amounts, if any, then due or that will become due on the Redemption Date as a result of the redemption, as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. The Notes shall constitute the senior, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and shall rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company. In the case of an Event of Default described in Section 5.01(5) or 5.01(6) of the Indenture, all unpaid principal of and accrued interest and Additional Amounts on the Notes then Outstanding shall be due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders of any Notes. In the case of all other Events of Default, if any A-6

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains, with certain exceptions as therein provided, provisions permitting Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding shall have made a written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it, (iii) the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, and (iv) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such written request during such 60-day period. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by any Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
