Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure. The following information is being furnished under Item 7.01, "Regulation FD Disclosure." This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, or incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. As contemplated by the Second Amended and Restated Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Winterthur International, dated February 15, 2001, as amended (the "SPA"), on February 3, 2005, both XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd ("XLI") and Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company ("Winterthur") submitted their respective proposed amounts for the independent actuarial process. The independent actuarial process is a "baseball-type" determination process, whereby either XLI's submitted number or Winterthur's submitted number will be the actual final seasoned amount, depending upon which number is closest to the number developed by the independent actuary. XLI's submission was developed with the support of leading third-party actuarial, accounting and claims advisors. This process was commenced because the parties were unable to come to an agreement as to the amount of the payments that are due under the SPA. XL Capital Ltd will discuss this process further on its earnings call to be held on February 10, 2005.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. Date: February 4, 2005 XL CAPITAL LTD (Registrant) By: /s/ Fiona Luck ----------------------------- Name: Fiona Luck Title: Executive Vice President, Global Head of Corporate Services & Assistant Secretary
