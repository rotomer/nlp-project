RECITALS A. By an Amended and Restated Sale and Purchase Agreement dated as of 15 February 2001 (the "SPA"), the Reinsurer agreed to sell to XL Insurance Ltd the Operations. B. Pursuant to the SPA, financial statements are being drawn up in respect of the Operations as at 31 December 2000 (the "31.12.2000 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") and as at the Completion Date (the "COMPLETION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). C. In order to help fix more precisely the values of the loss and loss adjustments expenses ("lae") provisions and other items in the 3.12.2000 Financial Statements, the parties have agreed to enter into this Reinsurance Agreement. This Reinsurance Agreement is intended to cover the run off of unpaid loss and lae provisions and certain other items as at 31 December 2000 between 1 January 2001 and the date of the Completion Financial Statements and to commute when the Completion Financial Statements have been agreed or otherwise determined (with an unqualified (clean) audit opinion by KPMG in accordance with the SPA, which shall not involve KPMG placing reliance on the continued existence of this Reinsurance Agreement) and the Purchase Price has been determined and paid, in each case in accordance with the SPA. ARTICLE 1 PERIOD OF REINSURANCE AGREEMENT - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This Reinsurance Agreement shall apply to losses incurred during the period between 31 December 2000 and the Commutation Effective Date. Additional cover details as described in the attached Schedule. ARTICLE 2 BUSINESS COVERED - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This Reinsurance Agreement shall apply to the business as described in the Schedule. ARTICLE 3 DEFINITIONS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Words and phrases defined in the SPA shall, in the absence of a definition in this Reinsurance Agreement, bear the meaning attributed to them in the SPA. ARTICLE 4 REINSURING CLAUSE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Reinsurer hereby agrees to indemnify the Principal Reinsured for the share as set out in the Schedule of that part of the Reinsureds' aggregate ultimate net loss during the period between 31 December 2000 and the Commutation Effective Date, which exceeds the amount of the - 2 -
deductible for the aggregate ultimate net loss during the period of this Reinsurance Agreement, as set out in the Schedule. The sum recoverable under this Reinsurance Agreement shall be up to but not exceeding the amount of cover for the aggregate ultimate net loss during the period of this Reinsurance Agreement as set out in the Schedule. Additional cover details as described in the attached Schedule. ARTICLE 5 DEFINITION OF "ULTIMATE NET LOSS" - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The term "ultimate net loss" shall mean the sums incurred by the Reinsureds in settlement of losses during the period of this Reinsurance Agreement, and, for the purpose of this reinsurance Agreement, the term "incurred" shall include sums paid, case reserves, loss expenses and reserves for incurred but not reported losses (in each case only applying a discount if a discount was applied in the 31.12.2000 Financial Statements, in which case such discount shall be applied on the same basis as it was applied in the 31.12.2000 Financial Statements). The term "loss expenses" shall include all the amounts incurred for actions, suits or proceedings and for other matters and things relating to any loss recoverable hereunder at the discretion of the Reinsured which in its judgement may be beneficial or expedient and all payments made and costs and expenses incurred therefore shall be considered (including for the avoidance of doubt allocated and unallocated lae). Salvages and recoveries, including recoveries from all other reinsurances shall be deducted from such loss to arrive at the amount of liability, if any, attaching hereunder. All salvages, recoveries or payments recovered or received subsequent to any loss settlement hereunder shall be applied as if recovered or received prior to the aforesaid settlement, and all necessary adjustments shall be made by the parties hereto. Nothing in this clause shall be construed to mean that losses are not recoverable hereunder until the Reinsureds' ultimate net loss has been ascertained and the Principal Reinsured shall be entitled to seek recovery under this Reinsurance Agreement notwithstanding that a Reinsured has not exhausted its rights under any reinsurance arrangements relating to the business protected under this Reinsurance Agreement, provided that (i) the Principal Reinsured and the Reinsureds have first sought in good faith to recover all reinsurance recoverables under any such reinsurance arrangements, (ii) to the extent that they have not been able to recover the same, used their respective reasonable endeavours in good faith to assign all outstanding rights against any third party under any such reinsurance arrangements and (iii) if they are not legally able to assign such outstanding rights they shall (following payment by the Reinsurer) continue to use their respective reasonable endeavours to exhaust such outstanding rights and, in such case, if they make any recovery in the course of any related proceedings or otherwise, the Principal Reinsured shall account to the Reinsurer for any amounts so recovered by the Reinsureds but only to the extent that the Principal Reinsured has made any recoveries against the Reinsurer under this Reinsurance Agreement. - 3 -

In the case of any other such commutation, termination or amendment, the Principal Reinsured shall use reasonable endeavours in good faith to inform the Reinsurer in advance of the such commutation, termination or amendment and the parties shall consult in good faith with respect to the same. - 4 -

The Reinsurer shall have the right to deduct any outstanding balances due to him from the Reinsureds under or in connection with this Reinsurance Agreement from any loss payment.

Calculation of Commutation Payment - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under this Reinsurance Agreement, at the Commutation Effective Date, a commutation payment (the "COMMUTATION PAYMENT") shall be made either from the Reinsurer to the Principal Reinsured (the "REINSURER'S COMMUTATION PAYMENT") or from the Principal Reinsured to the Reinsurer (the "PRINCIPAL REINSURED'S COMMUTATION PAYMENT"). Either a Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or a Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment shall be payable, but a Reinsurer's Commutation Payment and a Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment shall never both be payable. In order to determine whether a Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or a Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment is payable, the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment and the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment shall both be calculated in accordance with the formulae set out below. If the calculation of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment produces a negative figure in either case, the amount of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment, as the case may be shall be zero. If the calculation of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment produces a positive figure in either case, an amount equal to this figure shall be paid to, if the calculation of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment produces a positive figure, the Principal Reinsured, or, if the calculation of the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment produces a positive figure, the Reinsurer. In no circumstances shall a negative figure for either the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment, as the case may be, be set off against a positive figure for the other Commutation Payment. For the purposes of calculating the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment and the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment, the following definitions shall apply: a) Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (including IBNR) plus net provisions for future dividends to policyholders of the Operations at 31 December 2000, in respect of accident years 2000 and prior (being USD 1,117,529,000). b) Paid losses and lae and paid dividends to policyholders of the Operations during the period between 1 January 2001 and the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of accident years 2000 and prior. - 12 -
c) Net unpaid losses and 1ae provisions including IBNR and net provisions for future dividends to policyholders of the Operations at the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of accident years 2000 and prior. d) Adjustment to the run off profit or loss arising from the unwinding during the period between 1 January 2001 and the Commutation Effective Date of the discount in the net unpaid losses and 1ae provisions including IBNR of the Operations at 31 December 2000, in respect of accident years 2000 and prior. e) Net unearned premiums reserves less deferred acquisition costs of the Operations at 31 December 2000, in respect of underwriting years 2000 and prior (being USD 65,537,000). f) Earned premiums less earned acquisition costs of the Operations during the period between 1 January 2001 and the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of underwriting years 2000 and prior. g) Net unearned premiums reserves less deferred acquisition costs of the Operations at the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of underwriting years 2000 and prior. h) Net receivables from insurance and reinsurance companies (including deposits and estimates) of the Operations at 31 December 2000 (being USD 140,416,000). i) Payments during the period between 1 January 2001 and the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of net receivables from insurance and reinsurance companies (including deposits and estimates) of the Operations at 31 December 2000. j) Net receivables from insurance and reinsurance companies (including deposits and estimates) remaining at the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of receivables from insurance and reinsurance companies (including deposits and estimates) of the Operations at 31 December 2000. REINSURER'S COMMUTATION PAYMENT = RE-ESTIMATED LIABILITY - DEDUCTIBLE = a+b+c-d-e+f+g+h-i-j-USD 30,000,000, EXCEPT IF THIS AMOUNT IS NEGATIVE IN WHICH CASE THE REINSURER'S COMMUTATION PAYMENT SHALL BE ZERO. The deductible in the case of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment=a+e-h+USD 30,000,000 PRINCIPAL REINSURED'S COMMUTATION PAYMENT = DEDUCTIBLE - RE-ESTIMATED LIABILITY = a-b-c+d+e-f-g-h+i+j-USD 30,000,000, EXCEPT IF THIS AMOUNT IS NEGATIVE IN WHICH CASE THE REINSURED'S COMMUTATION PAYMENT SHALL BE ZERO. - 13 -
The deductible in the case of the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment = a+e-h-USD 30,000,000 EXAMPLE If: a=1000, b=200, c=900, d=10, e=350, f=150, g=250, h=200, i=50, j-140 Reinsurer's Commutation Payment=(1000+200+900-10-350+150+250+200-50-140-30)=120 Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment = (1000-200-900+10+350-150-250-200+50+ 140-30)=-180 The calculation of the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment produces a negative figure and would therefore be zero. The calculation of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment produces a positive figure and would be payable in accordance with this Reinsurance Agreement. - 14 -

Period of Reinsurance Effective 30 June 2001.

Calculation of Commutation Payment - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under this Reinsurance Agreement, a commutation payment as of the Commutation Effective Date (the "Commutation Payment"), shall be made either from the Reinsurer to the Principal Reinsured (the "Reinsurer's Commutation Payment") or from the Principal Reinsured to the Reinsurer (the "Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment") as set out in the Settlement of Balances provisions above. Either a Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or a Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment shall be payable, but a Reinsurer's Commutation Payment and a Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment shall never both be payable. In order to determine whether a Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or a Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment is payable, the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment and the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment shall both be calculated in accordance with the formulae set out below. If the calculation of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment produces a negative figure in either case, the amount of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment, as the case may be shall be zero. If the calculation of the reinsurer's Commutation Payment or the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment produces a positive figure in either case, an amount equal to this figure shall be paid to, if the calculation of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment produces a positive figure, the Principal Reinsured, or, if the calculation of the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment produces a positive figure, the Reinsurer. In no circumstances shall a negative figure for either the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment or the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment, as the case may be, be set off against a positive figure for the other Commutation Payment. For the purposes of calculating the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment and the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment, the following definitions shall apply (in each case, per US GAAP): a) Net unpaid losses and 1ae (including IBNR) plus net provisions for future dividends to policyholders of the Operations at 30 June 2001 (per the Unaudited Financial Statements), in respect of losses occurring on 30 June 2001 and prior. b) Paid losses and lae and paid dividends to policyholders of the Operations during the period between 1 July 2001 and the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of losses occurring on 30 June 2001 and prior.
c) Net unpaid losses and 1ae provisions including IBNR and net provisions for future dividends to policyholders of the Operations at the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of losses occurring on 30 June 2001 and prior. d) Adjustment to the run off profit or loss arising from the unwinding during the period between 1 July 2001 and the Commutation Effective date of the discount in the net unpaid losses and 1ae provisions including IBNR of the Operations at 30 June 2001 (per the Unaudited Financial Statements), in respect of losses occurring on 30 June 2001 and prior. e) Net unearned premiums reserves less deferred acquisition costs of the Operations at 30 June 2001, in respect of policies forming part of the Operations written on or prior to 30 June 2001 (per the Unaudited Financial Statements). f) Net earned premiums less earned acquisition costs of the Operations during the period between 1 July 2001 and the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of policies forming part of the Operations written on or prior to 30 June 2001. g) Net unearned premiums reserves less deferred acquisition costs of the Operations at the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of policies forming part of the Operations written on or prior to 30 June 2001. h) Net receivables from insurance and reinsurance companies (including deposits and estimates) of the Operations at 30 June 2001 (per the Unaudited Financial Statements). i) Payments during the period between 1 July 2001 and the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of net receivables from insurance and reinsurance companies (including deposits and estimates) of the Operations at 30 June 2001. j) Net receivables from insurance and reinsurance companies (including deposits and estimates) remaining at the Commutation Effective Date, in respect of receivables from insurance and reinsurance companies (including deposits and estimates) of the Operations at 30 June 2001. Reinsurer's Commutation Payment = re-estimated liability - deductible = a+b+c-d-e+f+g+h-i-j-USD 30,000,000, except if this amount is negative in which case the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment shall be zero. The deductible in the case of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment =a+e-h+USD 30,000,000 Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment = deductible - re-estimated liability = a-b-c+d+e-f-g-h+i+j-USD 30,000,000, except if this amount is negative in which case the Reinsured's Commutation Payment shall be zero.
The deductible in the case of the Principal Reinsured Commutation Payment = a+e-h-USD 30,000,000 EXAMPLE If: a=1000, b=200, c=900, d=10e, e=350, f=150, g=250, h=200, i=50, j-140 Reinsurer's Commutation Payment=(-1000+200+900-10-350+150+250+200+50-140-30)=120 Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment = (1000-200-900+10+350-150-250-200+50- 140-30)=-180 The calculation of the Principal Reinsured's Commutation Payment produces a negative figure and would therefore be zero. The calculation of the Reinsurer's Commutation Payment produces a positive figure and would be payable in accordance with this Reinsurance Agreement.

(B) Winterthur has made available certain cash facilities to WIRE to cover claims payable by WIRE to its reinsureds pending receipt of payments from its reinsurers pursuant to certain pre-existing arrangements (the "ORIGINAL AGREEMENT"). (C) Following Completion of the Sale and Purchase Agreement Winterthur has agreed to continue to make available a cash facility to WIRE on the terms set out in this Agreement. IT IS AGREED as follows: 1. Words and phrases defined in the Sale and Purchase Agreement shall in the absence of a definition in this Agreement bear the meaning attributed to them on the Sale and Purchase Agreement. 2. Winterthur hereby agrees to extend a limited recourse receivables financing facility (the "FACILITY") to WIRE in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 3. The parties acknowledge and agree that as at the date hereof Winterthur has advanced sums to WIRE under the Original Agreement of which approximately CHF 440 million remains outstanding (the actual balance being referred to as the "OUTSTANDING BALANCE"). This Agreement shall supersede and replace the terms of the Original Agreement in respect of such Outstanding Balance. 4. The period of availability of financing under the Facility shall be from the date hereof until the second anniversary of the date hereof (the "FACILITY PERIOD").
5. WIRE may at any time during the Facility Period draw down funds from the Facility subject to providing Winterthur with notice in writing (a "DRAW DOWN NOTICE") specifying the amount required and specifying that such amount will be used to satisfy claims payable by WIRE in respect of which WIRE has not received payment under its reinsurance arrangements which were in force for any period prior to the Effective Time (the "RELEVANT REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS") following WIRE having served a demand for payment under the Relevant Reinsurance Agreement. Upon receipt of such Draw Down Notice, Winterthur shall make the funds specified in the Draw Down Notice (each "AN ADVANCE") available to WIRE promptly (and in any event within 5 Business Days) by crediting such account as WIRE may specify from time to time in writing. 6. If there is no Outstanding Balance or Advance outstanding at the end of the Facility Period this Agreement shall terminate automatically at such time. 7. Winterthur acknowledges and agrees that WIRE shall have no obligation or liability to repay the Outstanding Balance or any Advance unless and until and then only to the extent that WIRE recovers any amount under the Relevant Reinsurance Agreement in respect of the claims paid by WIRE to which the Outstanding Balance or such Advance relates. If WIRE does make such recovery at any time prior to the End Date under the Relevant Reinsurance Agreement it will apply such recovery to repay the relevant portion of the Outstanding Balance to such account as Winterthur may specify from time to time in writing. WIRE shall provide quarterly statements to Winterthur setting forth, in reasonable detail, such payments and recoveries, accompanied by and payment to be made hereunder by WIRE to Winterthur within 30 days after the last day of each calendar quarter. 8.

Notwithstanding the above, WIRE shall, simultaneously with the making of the payment to be made under Clause 4.3 of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, repay the Outstanding Balance and any Advance which has not already been repaid, at WIRE's option, either (i) in cash in US Dollars; or (ii) by way of the transfer of rights to receive monies from its reinsurers (such rights to be valued for these purposes in the same way as they would be valued for the purposes of the seasoning mechanism under Clause 4 of the SPA and for the avoidance of doubt rights to receive monies from reinsurers who are at the relevant time subject to insolvency or receivership proceedings or other similar events arising after Completion being valued at zero); or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii) above, as WIRE may determine in its absolute discretion, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt the aggregate of the sums under (i) and (ii) to be repaid shall be equal to the aggregate of the Outstanding Balance and Advances outstanding. 9. In consideration of Winterthur's agreement to provide Advances WIRE agrees to pay interest from the date hereof on the lower of (i) the sum of the Outstanding Balance
outstanding from day to day and (ii) US$75 million at a rate equal to 3 month LIBOR plus 50 basis points for a period of six months from the date hereof only, such interest payment to be made promptly (and in any event within 5 Business Days of the end of the said period of six months).

ARTICLE 8 DEFINITION OF "LOSS OCCURRENCE" - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For the purposes of this Reinsurance Agreement the term "loss occurrence" shall consist of the sum of all individual insured losses which result from an accident, disaster, casualty or happening or series of accidents, disasters, casualties or happenings arising out of one event having the same proximate cause, regardless of the number of interests insured or the number of policies responding and which occur during a loss period of: a) 72 consecutive hours as regards hurricane, typhoon, windstorm, rainstorm, hailstorm and/or tornado b) 72 consecutive hours as regards earthquake, seaquake, tidal wave and/or volcanic eruption c) 72 consecutive hours and within the limits of one City, Town or Village as regards riots, civil commotions and malicious damage d) 72 consecutive hours as regards any "loss occurrence" which includes individual loss or losses from any of the perils mentioned in (a), (b) and (c) above e) 168 consecutive hours as regards flood, however caused d) 168 consecutive hours as regards any "loss occurrence" which includes individual loss or losses from any of the perils mentioned in (a) or (b) or (c) or (d) above when in combination with individual loss or losses from any of the peril mentioned in (e) above
General Conditions: WI Catastrophe Excess of Loss Reinsurance Agreement 2000 Page 4 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- g) 168 consecutive hours as regards any "loss occurrence" of whatsoever nature which does no include individual loss or losses from any of the perils mentioned in (a), (b) and (c), (d), (e), or (f) above and no individual loss from whatever insured peril which occurs outside these periods or areas shall be included in that "loss occurrence". The Reinsured may choose the time when any such period of consecutive hours commences and if any event is of greater duration than the above-mentioned periods, the Reinsured may divide that event into two or more "loss occurrences", provided that no two periods overlap and provided no such period commences earlier than the date and time of the happening of the first recorded individual loss to the Reinsured in respect of the event in question. ARTICLE 9 NET RELATED LINES - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This Reinsurance Agreement shall only protect that portion of any business which the Reinsured, acting in accordance with its established practice, retains net for its own account. The Reinsured's maximum retention each and every risk for own account shall not exceed the amount as set out in the Schedule(s). As regards the definition of "each and every risk", the Reinsured shall be the sole judge of what constitutes one risk, however this shall not differ from the written Underwriting guidelines of the Reinsured in this respect. The liability of the Reinsurer hereunder shall not be increased due to an error or omission which results in an increase in the Reinsured's normal net retention, nor by the Reinsured's failure to reinsure in accordance with its normal practice, nor by the inability of the Reinsured to collect from any other reinsurers any amounts which may have become due from them, whether such inability arises from the insolvency of such reinsurers or otherwise. ARTICLE 10 UNDERWRITING POLICY - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Reinsured undertakes not to introduce any change in its established acceptance and underwriting policy in respect of the classes of business protected under this Reinsurance Agreement without prior approval by the Reinsurer and any reinsurance arrangement related thereto shall be maintained or deemed to be maintained unaltered for the purpose of this Reinsurance Agreement. ARTICLE 11 REINSURANCE PREMIUM - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Reinsured shall pay to the Reinsurer the reinsurance premium(s) as set out in the Schedule(s). The term "premium income" shall mean the gross retained written premium income accounted by the Reinsured in the classes of business protected under this Reinsurance Agreement during the twelve month period for which the excess of loss premium is being calculated, less cancellations and return premiums as well as premiums paid for reinsurance which is to the benefit of this Reinsurance Agreement or as specified in the Schedule(s).

The settlement of the balances has to be effected as set out in the Schedule(s) and coordinated via the Treasury Department of the Reinsurer. ARTICLE 16 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is hereby understood and agreed that any inadvertent delays, omissions or errors made in connection with this Reinsurance Agreement shall not be held to relieve either of the parties hereto from any liability which would have attached to them hereunder if such delay, omission or error had not occurred provided that rectification is made upon discovery. ARTICLE 17 EXTENDED EXPIRATION - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If this Reinsurance Agreement should expire or be terminated while a loss occurrence covered hereunder is in progress it is understood and agreed that, subject to the other conditions of this Reinsurance Agreement, the Reinsurer hereon is responsible as if the entire loss or damage had occurred prior to the expiration of this Reinsurance Agreement, provided that no part of that loss

In the event of this Reinsurance Agreement being terminated at any date other than the last day in December in any one year then the premium due to the Reinsurer shall be calculated up to the date of termination on a pro rata basis of the annual reinsurance premium. The rights and obligations of both parties under this Reinsurance Agreement shall remain in full force until the effective date of termination.

ARTICLE 20 RATES OF EXCHANGE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In respect of losses in currency(ies) other than that in which the monetary limit of this Reinsurance Agreement is stated, the losses will be converted into this currency by using the exchange rate(s) in force on the date the settlement with the insured is affected (outstanding loss amounts at year end to be converted as per the exchange rates in the Reinsured's books). It is furthermore understood that the Reinsured's maximum retentions are expressed in the currency of the monetary limit of this Reinsurance Agreement or the equivalent in other currencies at the exchange rate ruling in the Reinsured's books on the commencement date of each year the Reinsurance Agreement is in force. ARTICLE 21 ARBITRATION - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Any disputes arising out of this Reinsurance Agreement or concerning its interpretation or validity shall be resolved on a friendly basis and in accordance with current reinsurance practice rather than

If either party fails to appoint an arbitrator within four weeks after being requested in writing by the other party to do so, or in the event of the arbitrators failing to agree as to the appointment of the umpire within an identical period after their own appointment, such arbitrator or umpire shall be appointed by the Upper Court of the Canton of Zurich. The procedure shall be at the discretion of the Court of Arbitration, whereby it shall dispense as far as possible with all legal formalities. It shall pronounce on the distribution between the parties of costs and charges. The ruling of the Court of Arbitration shall be in writing, stating the reasons for its decision and be signed. If one of the arbitrators refuses to sign the decision, this shall have no bearing on its validity. The decision shall be reached within three months after the Court of Arbitration is constituted. Otherwise the stipulations of the law of Switzerland shall be applicable to the Reinsurance Agreement.

The amount of each such payment shall be adjusted by means of the following formula: actual base index adjusted amount X ------------------------------ = payment of payment index on the date of payment value The above formula shall however only apply in respect of those payments where there is a variation of more than 10% as between the base index and the index on the date of payment.

Scotton Investor Relations Media Relations (441) 294-7201 (441) 294-7165 XL CAPITAL REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2004 NET INCOME OF $288.0 MILLION, OR $2.07 PER ORDINARY SHARE FULL YEAR 2004 NET INCOME A RECORD $1.13 BILLION, OR $8.13 PER ORDINARY SHARE YEAR END 2004 BOOK VALUE PER ORDINARY SHARE OF $51.98, UP 11% FROM DECEMBER 31, 2003 HAMILTON, BERMUDA, February 9, 2005 - XL Capital Ltd ("XL" or the "Company") (NYSE: XL) today reported net income available to ordinary shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $288.0 million, or $2.07 per ordinary share, compared with a net loss of $314.8 million, or a loss of $2.29 per ordinary share for the quarter ended December 31, 2003. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses(1) for the 2004 fourth quarter was $194.4 million, or $1.40 per ordinary share, compared with a net loss of $349.3 million, or a loss of $2.54 per ordinary share, for the year ago quarter. Net income and net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the 2004 fourth quarter included a previously announced charge related to the Indian Ocean tsunami and an increase in expected losses from the third quarter 2004 hurricanes of $138.0 million, after-tax, or $0.99 per ordinary share. 1
For the twelve months to December 31, 2004, net income available to ordinary shareholders was a record $1,126 million, or $8.13 per ordinary share, compared with $371.7 million, or $2.69 per ordinary share for the prior year. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the full year 2004 was also a record at $816.7 million, or $5.89 per ordinary share, compared with $293.6 million, or $2.12 per ordinary share for the full year 2003. Commenting on XL's results, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. O'Hara said: "XL's fourth quarter results continued the solid underlying performance we delivered throughout the year, with a combined ratio, excluding the impact of the Indian Ocean tsunami and an increase in expected losses from the third quarter 2004 hurricanes, of 87.0% and healthy year-over-year increases in net invested assets, cash flow from operations, net investment income and book value per ordinary share." "Full year 2004 net income of $1,126 million and net income excluding realized gains and losses of $816.7 million were both records. Taking into consideration the fact that we incurred over $550 million, after tax, in catastrophe-related losses during the year, these results are a testament to the underlying earnings strength of XL." "During 2004, we introduced a number of important strategic initiatives, including the launching of both our global whole account commercial property program and our primary Directors and Officers liability product in Europe and the start-up of our US primary casualty operation. I believe these initiatives, together with our core competitive advantages of global presence, leading product expertise and financial strength, will enable us to further differentiate our performance for our customers and shareholders going forward." With respect to the post-closing seasoning process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company ("Winterthur"), as contemplated in the amended sale and purchase agreement relating to our acquisition of Winterthur International, on February 3, 2005, both XL and Winterthur submitted their amounts for the independent valuation determination process. XL's submission would result in a net payable to XL of approximately $1.45 billion in aggregate and Winterthur's submission would result in a net payable to XL of approximately $541 million in aggregate. The independent valuation determination process is a "baseball-type" process, whereby either XL's submitted number or Winterthur's submitted number will be the actual final seasoned amount, depending upon which number is closest to the number developed by the independent actuarial valuation. 2
Mr. O'Hara further commented that "XL's submission was developed with the support of various leading, third-party actuarial and claims advisors and we are confident in our submission. We look forward to discussing this process further on our earnings call tomorrow." HIGHLIGHTS (VERSUS THE EQUIVALENT PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, UNLESS NOTED): FOURTH QUARTER 2004 o Net premiums written from general operations increased 6% to $1.3 billion o Combined ratio from general operations was 95.8%.

Net premiums written increased 17%, compared with the 2003 fourth quarter, to $1,031 million and the loss ratio for the quarter was 71.4%, a decrease of 6.4 points from the prior year quarter. The underwriting expense ratio of 24.5% increased 1 point compared with the 3
prior year quarter, as a 2.6 point increase in the operating expense ratio was partially offset by a 1.6 point decrease in the acquisition expense ratio. REINSURANCE OPERATIONS GENERAL OPERATIONS - Underwriting profit for the quarter was $48.7 million, compared with an underwriting loss of $483.6 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter included a $39.5 million pre-tax charge related to the impact of the Indian Ocean tsunami and an increase in expected losses from the third quarter 2004 hurricanes. Net premium written decreased 19%, compared with the 2003 fourth quarter, to $303.5 million, primarily due to decreased participation on certain contracts, in addition to the impact of ceded reinstatement premiums related to the increase in expected losses for the third quarter 2004 hurricanes. The loss ratio for the quarter was 65.5% compared with 146.4% in the prior year quarter and the underwriting expense ratio decreased 2.5 points compared with the prior year quarter to 30.1%. LIFE AND ANNUITY OPERATIONS - Income from Life and Annuity reinsurance operations increased 47% compared with the 2003 fourth quarter to $5.9 million. Net premiums written in the 2004 fourth quarter were $173.5 million, compared with $457.8 million in the prior year quarter. Net premiums written in the prior year quarter included two single premium annuity contracts totaling $395.5 million, whereas net premiums written in the 2004 fourth quarter included one $97.3 million single premium annuity transaction. Differences in the timing and size of these transactions can lead to volatility in year-over-year premium growth rates. Net investment income increased 50% to $57.9 million driven by a 52% increase in net invested assets to $4.7 billion. FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OPERATIONS FINANCIAL OPERATIONS - Contribution in the quarter was $34.2 million, an increase of $21.5 million compared with the 2003 fourth quarter. A $28.1 million improvement in unrealized gains from derivative exposures, primarily from financial guaranty transactions written in derivative form, in addition to higher investment income, more than offset higher incurred losses and operating expenses and a lower contribution from equity in net income of financial affiliates. Net premiums written increased 28% compared with the 2003 fourth quarter driven by a higher level of up-front premium transactions. LIFE AND ANNUITY OPERATIONS - Income in the quarter decreased $2.3 million compared with the prior year quarter to a loss of $4.7 million, as a decrease in net premiums earned more than offset higher net investment income less related interest expense. The total average balance of funding agreements and municipal reinvestment contracts increased $2.1 billion compared with the 2003 fourth quarter to $3.3 billion. 4
CORPORATE ITEMS Net investment income on general operations for the quarter increased 18% over the 2003 fourth quarter to $179.1 million, driven primarily by a 28% year-over-year increase in net invested assets. Net income from investment affiliates increased 5% over the prior year quarter to $47.3 million. Net realized gains on investments were $65.4 million in the quarter, compared with $39.9 million in the prior year quarter. Net unrealized gains on investments, net of tax, were $769.5 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $488.6 million at September 30, 2004. Total operating expenses were $288.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 44% from the fourth quarter of 2003. This increase was driven primarily by costs associated with continued growth in the Company's operations globally, work related to complying with Sarbanes-Oxley requirements, the impact of foreign exchange movement and costs associated with the Winterthur seasoning process.

XL CAPITAL LTD RECONCILIATION The following is a reconciliation of the Company's (i) net income to 'net (loss) income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax' (which is a non-GAAP measure, the "Exclusions") and (ii) annualized return on shareholders' equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders' equity for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (in millions, except per share amounts): 10
COMMENT ON REGULATION G This press release contains the presentation of (i) 'net (loss) income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivatives, net of tax' and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders' equity. These items are "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above. XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance. This presentation includes the use of 'net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivatives, net of tax'. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below). Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XL's operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XL's financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL generally holds its financial guarantee contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance of XL's financial guarantee operations. Unlike these credit derivatives, XL's weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business. In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing net income (loss) exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies who follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude 11
these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis. Return on average ordinary shareholder's equity ("ROE") minus the Exclusions is a widely used measure of any company's profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders' equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholder's equity. XL establishes target ROE's for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If XL's ROE return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, XL's compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependant on the achievement of performance goals to enhance shareholder value which include ROE. 12
