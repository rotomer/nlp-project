The Credit Agreement, as previously amended, had set the date of the Secondary Lender Stated Expiration Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as February 18, 2005, unless extended in accordance with the terms thereof.

The Amendment also amends the Credit Agreement to permit each of the Secured Parties (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to disclose XL Information (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to any actual or potential subordinated investor in any Conduit Lender (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or liquidity provider if such investor or liquidity provider has signed a confidentiality agreement with terms that are substantially similar to the terms of Section 9.09(c) of the Credit Agreement and otherwise in accordance with the terms thereof.
