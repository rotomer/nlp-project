Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On March 2, 2005, the Registrant entered into employment agreements, effective as of January 1, 2005, with the following executive officers: Charles F. Barr, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Anthony E. Beale, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Human Resources; Paul S. Giordano, Executive Vice President, Chief Executive of Financial Products & Services Operations; Henry C.V. Keeling, Executive Vice President, Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations and Global Head of Business Services of XL Capital Ltd; Fiona E. Luck, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Corporate Services and Assistant Secretary of XL Capital Ltd; and Clive R. Tobin, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive of Insurance Operations. Each employment agreement provides for (i) a base salary which initially is set at such executive's current base salary and is subject to annual review and may be increased by the Compensation Committee, (i) an annual bonus pursuant to the Registrant's incentive compensation plan as determined by the Compensation Committee, (iii) reimbursement for or payment of certain travel and other expenses and (iv) the right to participate in such other employee or fringe benefit programs as are in effect for senior executives from time to time. Each executive's employment is for an original term of one year and will continue to be automatically extended for successive one year periods unless the Registrant or the executive provides written notice that the term is not to be extended at least six months prior to the then scheduled expiration date. Each executive has agreed to certain confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation provisions. Each employment agreement further provides that, in the event of the termination of the executive's employment prior to the expiration date of the employment agreement (after giving effect to any extensions thereof) by reason of death or disability, the executive (or in the case of death, the executive's spouse or estate) shall be entitled to receive the executive's then current base salary through the end of the six month period after the month in which the executive's employment is terminated, and the executive (or the executive's estate) shall be entitled to any annual bonus awarded but not yet paid and a pro rata bonus for the year of termination in an amount determined by the Compensation Committee (but not less than a pro rata portion of the executive's average annual bonus for the immediately preceding three years). The executive (or the executive's estate) shall also be entitled to the executive's vested accrued benefits under any employee benefit programs, continued rights with regard to any stock options or other rights with respect to equity securities of the Registrant held by the executive in accordance with the terms of the plans under which such options or other rights were issued, and continued medical benefit plan coverage for the executive and the executive's dependents for a period of six months. In the event of termination of the executive's employment by the Registrant without Cause (as defined in the employment agreement) or by the executive if the executive is assigned duties inconsistent with his position (but such assignment does not constitute "Good Reason" as defined in the employment agreement), the executive shall be entitled to the executive's then current base salary through the date on which termination occurs, a cash lump sum payment equal to the sum of (x) two times the executive's then current base salary and (y) one times the higher of the targeted annual bonus for the year of such termination or the average of the executive's annual bonus for the three years immediately preceding the year of termination, and any annual bonus awarded but not yet paid. The executive shall also be entitled to the executive's vested accrued benefits under any employee benefit programs, continued rights with regard to any stock options or other rights with respect to equity securities of the Registrant held by the executive in accordance with the terms of the plans under which such options or other rights were issued and continued medical benefit plan coverage for the executive and the executive's dependents for a period of 24 months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of termination of the executive's employment (x) by the Registrant without Cause within the 24-month period following a Change in Control (as defined in the employment agreement) (the "Post-Change Period"), (y) by the executive for Good Reason during the Post-Change Period or (z) by the Registrant within one year prior to a Change in Control and it is reasonably demonstrated that such termination arose in connection with or anticipation of the Change in Control, then the executive shall be entitled to (i) the executive's then current base salary through the date on which termination occurs; (ii) a cash lump sum payment equal to the sum of (x) two times the executive's then current base salary and (y) two times the average of the executive's annual bonus for the three years immediately preceding the year in which the Change in Control occurs, provided such bonus shall be at least equal to the targeted annual bonus for the year of such termination; and (iii) an amount equal to the higher of (x) the executive's annual bonus actually awarded in the year immediately preceding the year in which the Change in Control occurs or (y) the targeted annual bonus that would have been awarded to the executive for the year of such termination, pro rated by a fraction based on the number of months or fraction thereof in which the executive was employed by the Registrant in the year of termination. The executive shall also be entitled to continued medical benefit plan coverage for the executive and the executive's dependents for a period of 24 months and to accelerated vesting of the executive's rights (i) under any retirement plans and (ii) with regard to any stock options or other rights with respect to equity securities of the Registrant held by the
executive, which options or other rights shall be exercisable for the shorter of three years or the original term of the security. In addition, the executive shall be entitled to gross-up payments in the event excise taxes on the executive's payments or benefits are imposed under Section 280G of the United States Internal Revenue Code. In the event of termination of the executive's employment by the Registrant with Cause or other voluntary termination by the executive, the executive shall be entitled to the executive's then current base salary through the date on which termination occurs and continued rights with regard to any stock options or other rights with respect to equity securities of the Registrant held by the executive in accordance with the terms of the plans under which such options or equity securities were issued. The executive shall also be entitled to the executive's vested accrued benefits under any employee benefit programs in the case of voluntary termination and, if such programs expressly provide for such benefits, in the case of termination by the Registrant with Cause. Each employment agreement also provides for indemnification of the executive by the Registrant to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and the Registrant's charter documents and requires the Registrant to maintain directors' and officers' liability coverage in an amount equal to at least $75,000,000. Each of the executive officers also was awarded stock options or shares of the Registrant's restricted common stock in consideration for his or her entering into the employment agreement. A copy of the form of employment agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein. Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers. On March 8, 2005, Paul E. Jeanbart informed the Registrant that he would not be standing for re-election as a Director of the Registrant at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to be held on April 29, 2005. No disagreement between Mr. Jeanbart and the Registrant that would require disclosure under Item 5.02(a) of Form 8-K has occurred. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits.

EMPLOYMENT. Subject to Section 3(d) below, the Company hereby employs the Executive, and the Executive hereby accepts employment with the Company, for the term of this Agreement as set forth in Section 2, below, in the position and with duties and responsibilities set forth in Section 3, below, and upon such other terms and conditions as are hereinafter stated. 2. TERM OF EMPLOYMENT. Subject to Section 3(d) below, the stated term of employment under this Agreement shall commence on the date first above written (the "Date of the Agreement") and shall continue through the close of business on the first anniversary of the Date of the Agreement, subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 8, below, and extension as provided in the next succeeding sentence. On the first anniversary of the Date of the Agreement and on each anniversary thereafter, the stated term of employment shall be automatically extended for an additional one year unless the Company gives notice in writing to the Executive or the Executive gives notice in writing to the Company at least six months prior to such anniversary that the term is not to be so extended. 3. POSITIONS, DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. (a) GENERAL. The Executive shall be employed as the ___________________________ of the Company. In such position, the Executive shall have the duties, responsibilities and authority normally associated with the office, position and

[In addition, the Executive shall also serve as a Director of the Company.] In carrying out his duties and responsibilities, the Executive shall report to __________________________. During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall devote his full business time to the business and affairs of the Company, and shall use his best efforts, skills and abilities to promote the Company's interests. (b) PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. The Executive's services under this Agreement, which are global in nature, shall be performed at the location or locations reasonably requested by the Company [; provided, however, that such services will be performed outside the United States and in accordance with the guidelines established by the Company from time to time for the location of the performance of services on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries.](1) The Executive acknowledges that the Company may require the Executive to travel to the extent such travel is reasonably necessary to perform the services hereunder and that such travel may be extensive. To the extent reasonably requested by the Company, the Executive shall allocate greater business time to a location other than his principal business location, and if reasonably requested by the Company, the Executive shall relocate to such other locations. Any such relocation will not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement. (c) [WORK PERMITS. The employment of the Executive by the Company shall be contingent upon the issuance to the Executive of a suitable (for the purposes of the Executive's contemplated employment by the Company) work permit by the Bermuda government authorities and any other permits required by any Bermuda government authority. Both the Company and the Executive shall use their respective best efforts to obtain, maintain and renew said permit(s) so as to allow the Executive to be employed under the terms hereof. The Company shall be responsible for permit fees. If at any time said permit(s), having been obtained, expire and are not renewed or cease to be valid and such renewal or validation is necessary in order for the Executive to be employed by the Company as contemplated by this Agreement and the non-renewal or invalidation is beyond the control of both the Company and the Executive, employment under this Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the expiration of said permit(s) or upon said permit(s) ceasing to be valid unless the Executive can discharge his duties and responsibilities effectively from another location not requiring said permit(s) that is reasonably acceptable to the Executive and non-prejudicial to the interests of the Company. In the event of such termination, the provisions of Section 8(d) shall apply to such termination of the Executive's employment (or, if within (i) the one-year - ---------- 1 Insert for Bermuda-based executives.
-3- period prior to the date of a Change in Control, as hereinafter defined, provided the conditions set forth in the last paragraph of Section 8(d)(iii) are satisfied, or (ii) the Post-Change Period, as hereinafter defined, such termination shall be considered a termination by the employee for "Good Reason") provided that non-renewal of said permit(s) or invalidation thereof are not a direct result of any material action or omission of the Executive that would reasonably cause such permit(s) not to be renewed or validated.](2) 4. BASE SALARY. The Executive shall be paid a Base Salary by the Company equal to US$_________, payable in accordance with the Company's regular pay practices. Such Base Salary shall be subject to annual review in accordance with the Company's practices for executives as in effect from time to time and may be increased at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the "Compensation Committee"). 5. BONUSES.

The Executive may be awarded such annual bonuses thereunder as may be approved by the Compensation Committee based on corporate, individual and business unit performance measures, as appropriate, established or approved from time to time, by the Compensation Committee. Any annual bonus shall be paid in cash in a lump sum promptly following approval thereof or, at Executive's option, deferred in accordance with any bonus deferral plans of the Company in effect from time to time. Nothing in this Section 5 shall confer upon the Executive any right to a minimum annual bonus. 6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

(d) TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE. (i) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Executive's employment may be terminated by the Company without Cause as provided in this Section 8(d). A termination due to death or disability, as described in Section 8(a) or (b), above, or a termination for Cause, as described in Section 8(c), above, shall not be deemed a termination without Cause under this Section 8(d).

-10- (F) for a period of twenty-four months following the termination of the Executive's employment, continued medical benefit plan coverage (including dental and vision benefits if provided under the applicable plans) for the Executive (and the Executive's dependents, if any) under the Company's medical benefit plans upon substantially the same terms and conditions (including cost of coverage to the Executive) as is then in existence for other executives during the coverage period; provided, that, if the Executive cannot continue to participate in the Company plans providing such benefits, the Company shall otherwise provide such benefits on substantially the same after-tax basis as if continued participation had been permitted; provided, however, that, in the event the Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and becomes eligible to receive medical benefits from such employer, the medical benefits described herein shall immediately cease, and (G) full and immediate vesting under the Company's retirement plans as of the date of termination, to the extent permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that if such full and immediate vesting cannot be provided under a retirement plan under applicable law, then economically equivalent benefits, determined on an after tax basis to the Executive, shall be provided through arrangements outside the applicable retirement plan. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits described in (A)-(G) above, if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated (other than for Cause) within one year prior to the date on which a Change in Control occurs, and it is reasonably demonstrated that such termination (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated or intended to effect the Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of the Change in Control; provided, however, that in such event, amounts will be payable hereunder only following the Change in Control. (iv) If, in situations where Section 8(d)(iii) does not apply, at any time during the term of the Executive's employment hereunder, duties are assigned to the Executive that are materially inconsistent with his position, or the Company does not cure any material breach by it of any provision of Sections 4 through 7 of this Agreement within 30 calendar days following written notice of same by the Executive, the Executive shall have the right to terminate his employment within 30 calendar days of such assignment or of such failure to cure a breach, as the case may be, and such termination shall be deemed a termination by the Company without Cause under Section 8(d)(ii), above, provided, in the case of assignment of inconsistent duties, the Executive shall have given the Company written notice of his decision and shall not,
-11- within 30 calendar days thereafter, have had the assignment of inconsistent duties rescinded. (e) VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY THE EXECUTIVE. The Executive may voluntarily terminate his employment prior to the expiration of the term of this Agreement upon at least three months' prior written notice to the Company. Such termination shall constitute a voluntary termination and, except as provided in Section 8(d)(iii) or Section 8(d)(iv), above, in such event the Executive shall be limited to the same rights and benefits as applicable to a termination by the Company for Cause as provided in Section 8(c), above. A voluntary termination in accordance with this Section 8(e) shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement. A termination of the Executive's employment due to disability or death as described in Section 8(b) or 8(a), above, a termination by the Executive which the Executive is entitled to treat as a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8(d), above, or a termination by the Executive under Section 8(d)(iv), above, shall not be deemed a voluntary termination within the meaning of this Section 8(e). 9. EXCISE TAX PAYMENTS. (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that (i) any payment or distribution made, or benefit provided (including, without limitation, the acceleration of any payment, distribution or benefit or accelerated vesting or exercisability of any award) by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (or any successor provision or similar excise tax), or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), (ii) the aggregate amount of the Executive's Parachute Payments (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) is less than 3.25 times the Executive's Base Amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Code), and (iii) no such Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax if the payments set forth in Section 8(d)(iii)(B) and (C) hereof were each reduced by up to 20 percent, then the payments set forth in Section 8(d)(iii)(B) and (C) will each be reduced to the smallest extent possible (and in no event by more than 20 percent in the aggregate) such that no Payment is subject to the Excise Tax. (b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that (i) the aggregate amount of the Executive's Parachute Payments equals or exceeds 3.25 times the Executive's Base Amount, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Executive's Parachute Payments is less than 3.25 times the Base Amount but one or more Payments would be subject to the Excise Tax even if the payments set forth in Section 8(d)(iii)(B) and (C) hereof were each reduced by 20 percent, or (iii) notwithstanding a
-12- reduction in payments pursuant to Section 9(a) above, an Excise Tax is payable by the Executive on one or more Payments, then, in any such case, Payments shall not be reduced and the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any income or Excise Tax) imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes, the Executive retains from the Gross-Up Payment an amount equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(d), all determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including determination of whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and of the amount of any such Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by a nationally recognized public accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the date of termination of the Executive's employment, if applicable, or such earlier time as is reasonably requested. The initial Gross-Up Payment, if any, as determined pursuant to this Section 9(c), shall be paid to the Executive within five business days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion that he has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his Federal income tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm meeting the requirements of this Section 9(c) shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive, subject only to payments pursuant to the following sentence based on a determination that additional Gross-Up Payments should have been made, consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder (the amount of such additional payments are referred to herein as the "Gross-Up Underpayment"). In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 9(d) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Gross-Up Underpayment that has occurred and any such Gross-Up Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Company. (d) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the United States Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Executive of any Excise Tax and, therefore, the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but not later than 30 business days after the Executive receives written notice of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires, in good faith, to contest such claim (which notice shall set forth the bases for such contest) and that it will bear
-13- the costs and provide the indemnification as required by this sentence, the Executive shall, in good faith: (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim, (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall, in good faith, reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive, (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and (iv) permit the Company to participate, in good faith, in any proceedings relating to such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis to the Executive, for any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation and payment of all costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(d), the Company shall, exercising good faith, control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option (but in good faith), may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option (but in good faith), either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis to the Executive, from any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to the payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the
-14- Company pursuant to Section 9(d), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(d)) promptly pay to the Company, as the case may be, the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(d), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then any obligation of the Executive to repay such advance shall be forgiven and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Executive's failure to strictly comply with the notice provisions set forth in this Section 9, so long as such failure does not prevent the Company from contesting an excise tax claim, shall not adversely affect the Executive's rights under this Section 9. 10. NO MITIGATION; NO OFFSET. In the event of any termination of employment under Section 8, above, the Executive shall be under no obligation to mitigate damages or seek other employment, and, except as expressly set forth herein, there shall be no offset against amounts due the Executive under this Agreement on account of any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that he may obtain. 11. NONCOMPETITION AND NONSOLICITATION. The Executive represents and warrants that, to the best of his knowledge, he is not using the confidential or proprietary information of any other person in violation of any agreement or rights of others known to him. The Executive agrees that the products of the Company and its Affiliates shall constitute the exclusive property of the Company and its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, all trademarks, policy language or forms, products or services (including products and services under development), trade names, trade secrets, service marks, designs, computer programs and software, utility models, copyrights, know-how and confidential information, applications for registration of any of the foregoing and the right to apply for them in any part of the world (whether any of the foregoing shall be registered or unregistered) created or discovered or participated in by the Executive during the course of his employment (whether or not pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) or under the instructions of the Company or its Affiliates are and shall be the absolute property of the Company and its Affiliates, as appropriate. Without limiting the foregoing, the Executive hereby assigns to the Company any and all of the Executive's right, title and interest, if any,
-15- pertaining to the insurance and reinsurance (including, without limitation, finite insurance and reinsurance), risk assumption, risk management, brokerage, financial and other products or services developed or improved upon by the Executive (including, without limitation, any related "know-how") while employed by the Company or its Affiliates, including any patent, trademark, trade name, copyright, ownership or other right that may pertain thereto. Since Executive has obtained and is likely to obtain in the course of Executive's employment with the Company and its Affiliates knowledge of trade names, trade secrets, know-how, products and services (including products and services under development), techniques, methods, lists, computer programs and software and other confidential information relating to the Company and its Affiliates, and their employees, clients, business or business opportunities, Executive hereby undertakes that: (i) Executive will not (either alone or jointly with or on behalf of others and whether directly or indirectly) encourage, entice, solicit or endeavor to encourage, entice or solicit away from employment with the Company or its Affiliates, or hire or cause to be hired, any officer or employee of the Company or its Affiliates (or any individual who was within the prior twelve months an officer or employee of the Company or its Affiliates), or encourage, entice, solicit or endeavor to encourage, entice or solicit any individual to violate the terms of any employment agreement or arrangement between such individual and the Company or any of its Affiliates; (ii) Executive will not (either alone or jointly with or on behalf of others and whether directly or indirectly) interfere with or disrupt or seek to interfere with or disrupt (A) the relationships between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any customer or client of the Company and its Affiliates, on the other hand, (including any insured or reinsured party) who during the period of twenty-four months immediately preceding such termination shall have been such a customer or client, or (B) the supply to the Company and its Affiliates of any services by any supplier or agent or broker who during the period of twenty-four months immediately preceding such termination shall have supplied services to any such person, nor will Executive interfere or seek to interfere with the terms on which such supply or agency or brokering services during such period as aforesaid have been made or provided; and (iii) Executive will not (either alone or jointly with or on behalf of others and whether directly or indirectly) whether as an employee, consultant, partner, principal, agent, distributor, representative or stockholder (except solely as a less than one percent stockholder of a publicly traded company), engage in any activities [in Bermuda, the United Kingdom or the United States if such activities are competitive with the businesses that (i) are then being conducted by the Company or its Affiliates and (ii) during the period of the Executive's employment were either being conducted by the Company or its Affiliates or actively being developed by the Company or its Affiliates.
-16- The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall continue as long as the Executive is employed by the Company or its Affiliates and such provisions shall continue in effect after such employment is terminated for any reason until the first anniversary of such termination, provided that if such employment is terminated by the Company under Section 8(d)(iii) or by the Executive under Section 8(d)(iii), the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) shall automatically terminate upon such termination of employment, unless the Company elects, in writing, upon such termination to continue the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) in effect through the six-month anniversary of such termination of employment in which case the Company shall be obligated to continue (through such six-month anniversary of termination) to pay the Executive, in addition to any of the Executive's rights under Section 8(d)(iii), his Base Salary and the pro rata portion of the Executive's average annual bonus for the three years (or shorter period of employment by the Company) immediately preceding the year of termination, and such pro rated average annual bonus shall be payable at the times annual bonuses for such year are payable to other executives. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Affiliate" of the Company includes any person, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company, and such term shall specifically include, without limitation, the Company's majority-owned subsidiaries. The limitations on the Executive set forth in this Section shall also apply to any agent or other representative acting on behalf of Executive. While the restrictions aforesaid are considered by both parties to be reasonable in all the circumstances it is recognized that restrictions of the nature in question may fail for reasons unforeseen and accordingly it is hereby declared and agreed that if any of such restrictions or the geographic or other scope thereof shall be adjudged to be void as going beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of the interests of the Company and its Affiliates but would be valid if part of the wording thereof were deleted and/or the periods (if any) thereof reduced and/or geographic or other area dealt with thereby reduced in scope then said restrictions shall apply with such modifications as may be necessary to make them valid and effective. Nothing contained in this Section 11 shall limit in any manner any additional obligations to which Executive may be bound pursuant to any other agreement or any applicable law, rule or regulation and Section 11 shall apply, subject to its terms, after employment has terminated for any reason. 12. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Executive covenants that he shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, use for the Executive's own benefit or the benefit of any other person or entity other than the Company and its Affiliates or disclose to any person, other than an employee of
-17- the Company or other person to whom disclosure is necessary to the performance by the Executive of his duties in the employ of the Company, any confidential, proprietary, secret, or privileged information about the Company or its Affiliates or their business or operations, including, but not limited to, information concerning trade secrets, know-how, software, data processing systems, policy language and forms, inventions, designs, processes, formulae, notations, improvements, financial information, business plans, prospects, referral sources, lists of suppliers and customers, legal advice and other information with respect to the affairs, business, clients, customers, agents or other business relationships of the Company or its Affiliates. Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret, confidential proprietary or privileged information or data relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates or predecessor companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by Executive during his employment, unless and until such information has become known to the public generally (other than as a result of unauthorized disclosure by the Executive) or unless he is required to disclose such information by a court or by a governmental body with apparent authority to require such disclosure. The foregoing covenant by the Executive shall be without limitation as to time and geographic application and this Section 12 shall apply in accordance with its terms after employment has terminated for any reason. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he shall have no authority to waive any attorney-client or other privilege without the express prior written consent of the Compensation Committee as evidenced by the signature of the Company's General Counsel. 13. WITHHOLDING. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to be made by the Company hereunder to the Executive shall be subject to withholding of such amounts relating to taxes as the Company may reasonably determine should be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. In lieu of withholding such amounts, in whole or in part, the Company may, in its sole discretion, accept other provision for payment of taxes as required by law, provided it is satisfied that all requirements of law affecting its responsibilities to withhold such taxes have been satisfied. 14. GUARANTY AND AFFILIATE SERVICES. (a) LIABILITY. Each of XL Insurance Ltd and XL Re Ltd (together, the "Guarantors") hereby agrees to be jointly and severally liable together with the Company, for the performance of all obligations and duties, and the payment of all amounts, due to the Executive under this Agreement. (b) RESPONSIBILITY. All of the other terms and provisions of this Agreement relating to the Executive's employment by the Company shall likewise apply mutatis mutandis to the Executive's employment by any of its Affiliates, it being understood that if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated, his employment with its Affiliates shall also be terminated and the Executive shall be required to resign immediately
-18- from all directorships and other positions held by the Executive in the Company and its Affiliates or in any other entities in respect of which the Executive was acting as a representative or designee of the Company or its Affiliates in connection with his employment. 15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits, contains the entire agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, discussions, negotiations and undertakings, whether written or oral, between the Company and the Executive with respect thereto. 16. ASSIGNABILITY; BINDING NATURE. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, heirs and assigns. No rights or obligations of the Executive under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Executive other than his right to compensation and benefits hereunder, which may be transferred by will or operation of law subject to the limitations of this Agreement. No rights or obligations of the Company under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company except that such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred pursuant to a merger or consolidation or amalgamation or scheme of arrangement in which the Company is not the continuing entity, or the sale or liquidation of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, provided that the assignee or transferee is the successor to all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and such assignee or transferee assumes by operation of law or in writing duly executed by the assignee or transferee all of the liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company, as contained in this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law. 17.

Such directors' and officers' liability insurance shall be maintained in effect for a period of six years following termination of the Executive's employment for any reason other than pursuant to Section 8(c) or Section 8(e) hereof. 18. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES. (a) Any dispute between the Parties arising from or relating to the terms of this Agreement or the Executive's employment with the Company or its Affiliates shall,

(b) Executive acknowledges that the Company and its Affiliates will suffer irreparable injury, not readily susceptible of valuation in monetary damages, if Executive breaches his obligations under Section 11 or 12. Accordingly, Executive agrees that the Company and its Affiliates will be entitled, in addition to any other available remedies, to obtain injunctive relief against any breach or prospective breach by Executive of his obligations under Section 11 or 12 in any Federal or state court sitting in the City and State of New York or court sitting in Bermuda or the United Kingdom, or, at the Company's or any Affiliate's election, in any other jurisdiction in which Executive maintains his residence or his principal place of business. Executive hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of all those courts for the purposes of any actions or proceedings instituted by the Company or its Affiliates to obtain such injunctive relief, and Executive agrees that process in any or all of those actions or proceedings may be served by registered mail or delivery, addressed to the last address of Executive known to the Company or its Affiliates, or in any other manner authorized by law. Executive further agrees that, in addition to any other remedies available to the Company or its Affiliates by operation of law or otherwise, because of any breach by Executive of his obligations under Section 11 or 12 he will forfeit any and all bonus and rights to any payments to which he might otherwise then be entitled by virtue hereof and such payments may be suspended so long as any good faith dispute with respect thereto is continuing; provided, however, that payments, benefits and other rights and privileges of the Executive under this Agreement following termination of the Executive's employment during a Post Change Period shall not be forfeited, suspended, offset, diminished or otherwise altered in any way on account of any breach or prospective breach of Section 11, Section 12 or any other provision of this Agreement alleged by the Company. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Executive may elect to resolve any dispute involving a breach or alleged breach of this Agreement following termination of the Executive's employment during a Post-Change Period in any Federal or State court sitting in the City and State of New York or court sitting in Bermuda or the United Kingdom.
