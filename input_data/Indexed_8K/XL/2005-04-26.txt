Net income excluding net realized gains and losses(1) for the first quarter of 2005 was a record at $346.5 million, or $2.49 per ordinary share, compared with $332.5 million, or $2.39 per ordinary share, for the year ago quarter. Commenting on XL's first quarter 2005 results, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. O'Hara said: "I am pleased to report XL delivered one of its highest levels of net income ever this quarter and record net income excluding net realized gains and losses. These results are a testament to the strength of our diversified growth strategy, with solid underwriting profitability in our insurance and reinsurance general operations, complimented by strong performances in our financial products and investment affiliates businesses. Annualized return on shareholders' equity, based on net income excluding net realized gains and losses, was a very satisfactory 19.1% and book value per ordinary share increased to $52.13, despite the increase in interest rates during the quarter."

Net premiums written of $1,280 million decreased 1%, compared with the 2004 first quarter. The loss ratio of 67.0% increased 5.2 points from the prior year period and included losses of $6.6 million, pre-tax, from European storm Erwin, in addition to unfavorable prior year net loss development of $48.0 million, pre-tax, primarily in professional lines. The underwriting expense ratio of 24.5% decreased 3.5 points, compared with the prior year period, driven primarily by a 2.9 point decrease in the operating expense ratio, principally reflecting higher net premiums earned. Reinsurance General Operations - Underwriting profit for the quarter was $93.4 million, compared with $101.3 million for the prior year period. Net premiums written of $1,568 million increased 4%, compared with the 2004 first quarter, driven primarily by a lower level of ceded premium. The loss ratio was 60.0%, compared with 60.9% in the prior year period, and included pre-tax losses of $45.3 million related to European storm Erwin, partially offset by favorable prior year net loss development of $18.0 million, pre-tax, primarily in property lines. The underwriting expense ratio increased marginally, compared with the prior year period, to 26.9%. Life and Annuity Operations - Income from Life and Annuity reinsurance operations was $5.0 million, compared with $12.8 million for the first quarter of 2004. Net premiums written of $81.3 million decreased
11%, compared with the prior year period, primarily reflecting a higher level of ceded premium related to reinsurance treaties entered into during the first quarter of 2005. Claims and policy benefits increased 9% to $125.6 million due to increased losses associated with certain run-off blocks of U.S. life and annuity business. Net investment income increased 33% to $59.9 million, driven by a 34% increase in net invested assets to $4.7 billion. Financial Products and Services Contribution from financial operations was $77.7 million, an increase of $39.1 million from the prior year period. Market conditions within the financial guaranty industry remained competitive during the quarter, contributing to a 21% decrease in net premiums written, compared with the prior year period, to $52.6 million. Underwriting profit increased $10.1 million to $33.0 million, driven primarily by a higher level of fee income in both the Company's Financial Guaranty and Financial Solutions businesses. The increase in contribution from financial operations was further driven by a $11.9 million increase in results from derivatives, due primarily to the settlement of certain weather contracts; increases of $6.4 million and $6.1 million in financial guaranty net investment income and net income from affiliates, respectively; and a $5.6 million decrease in structured products operating expenses, due primarily to lower compensation costs. Corporate Items Net investment income from general operations for the quarter increased 17%, compared with the 2004 first quarter, to $171.9 million driven primarily by a 21% year-over-year increase in total net invested assets to $32.8 billion. Net income from investment affiliates increased 11% over the prior year period to $70.5 million, driven primarily by a stronger performance in private equity fund investments. Net realized gains on investments were $60.7 million in the quarter, compared with $115.3 million in the prior year period. Net unrealized gains on investments, net of tax, were $428.4 million at March 31, 2005, compared with $769.5 million at December 31, 2004. Total operating expenses were $247.2 million in the quarter, up marginally compared with $245.3 million in the prior year period. (1) Defined as "net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivatives, net of tax" (herein referred to as "net income excluding net realized gains and losses"). Net income excluding net realized gains and losses is a non-GAAP measure. See the schedule entitled "Reconciliation" at the end of this release for a reconciliation of net income excluding net realized gains and losses to net income available to ordinary shareholders. Update on Winterthur Independent Actuarial Process XL recently met with the independent actuary and Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company ("Winterthur Swiss") with respect to the post-closing seasoning process relating to XL's acquisition of Winterthur International from Winterthur Swiss in 2001. Based on these discussions, XL expects that the independent actuary's report will be issued in the fourth quarter of this year. XL's submission would result in a net payable to XL of approximately $1.45 billion in aggregate and Winterthur Swiss' submission would result in a net payable to XL of approximately $541 million in aggregate. The independent valuation
process is a "baseball-type" process, whereby either XL's submitted number or Winterthur Swiss' submitted number will be the actual final seasoned amount, depending upon which number is closest to the number developed by the independent actuary. # # # The Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2005 results on Wednesday, April 27, 2005 at 10:00 am EDT.

XL CAPITAL LTD RECONCILIATION The following is a reconciliation of the Company's (i) net income to 'net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax' (which is a non-GAAP measure, the "Exclusions") and (ii) annualized return on shareholders' equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders' equity for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 (in millions, except per share amounts): Note 1: Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Comment on Regulation G This press release contains the presentation of (i) 'net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivatives, net of tax' and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions). These items are "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above. XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance. This presentation includes the use of `net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivatives, net of tax'. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below). Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XL's operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XL's financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL generally holds its financial guarantee contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance of XL's financial guarantee operations. Unlike these credit derivatives, XL's weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business. In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income, XL believes that showing net income exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income makes it much more difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies who follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.
Return on average ordinary shareholder's equity ("ROE") minus the Exclusions is a widely used measure of any company's profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders' equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholder's equity. XL establishes target ROE's for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If XL's ROE return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, XL's compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependant on the achievement of performance goals to enhance shareholder value which include ROE.
