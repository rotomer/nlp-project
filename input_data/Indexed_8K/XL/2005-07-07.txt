Exhibit 99.1 [XL Capital Logo Omitted] XL CAPITAL LTD XL House One Bermudiana Road P. O. Box HM 2245 Hamilton HM JX Bermuda Phone: (441) 292-8515 Fax: (441) 292-5280 PRESS RELEASE IMMEDIATE Contact: Lily Outerbridge Roger R. Scotton Investor Relations Media Relations (441) 294-7345 (441) 294-7165 XL CAPITAL LTD ANNOUNCES THAT SECOND QUARTER 2005 RESULTS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY AN INCREASE IN RESERVES IN ITS NORTH AMERICAN REINSURANCE OPERATIONS Hamilton, Bermuda (July 7, 2005): -- XL Capital Ltd (NYSE: XL) ("XL" or the "Company") announced today that its second quarter 2005 results will be adversely impacted by an increase in net reserves in its North American reinsurance operations of $191 million pre-tax. The after tax charge is $183 million or $1.31 per ordinary share. This increase resulted from XL's scheduled semi-annual reserve review which is substantially complete. However there is an ongoing review relating to policy benefit reserves with respect to certain novated blocks of U.S.-based-term life mortality reinsurance business which XL expects to complete by the time of issuing its earnings release on July 27, 2005. The reserve increase is attributable to the following sources: RESERVE INCREASE % OF TOTAL SOURCE (IN $000) RESERVE INCREASE Workers' Compensation ("WC") $ 64,719 34% 1997 - 2001 underwriting years excluding WC 76,011 40% Pre - 1997 underwriting years excluding WC 15,603 8% -------- --- SUB TOTAL 156,333 82% Post - 2001 underwriting years excluding WC 34,306 18% -------- --- NET RESERVE INCREASE PRE TAX 190,639 100% Tax 7,780 -------- TOTAL NET RESERVE INCREASE $182,859
Approximately 90% of the Workers' Compensation reserve increase is related to an XL Reinsurance America Inc. ("XLRA") working layer program written across multiple underwriting years with a single cedent. This program was not renewed at the end of 2001. Other than this program, XLRA has not written significant working layer Workers' Compensation business. The reserve increase related to the 1997- 2001 underwriting years, excluding Workers' Compensation, was principally driven by recently reported claims in Umbrella Liability, Errors & Omissions and Directors & Officers lines of business in those underwriting years. The professional lines claims activity arises largely from a limited number of cedents. This reserve increase was partially offset by favorable development in the 1997- 2001 underwriting years in the Medical Malpractice business line. The reserve increase related to the pre -1997 underwriting years, excluding Workers' Compensation, was primarily driven by a small number of increased reported claims in the Other Liability and Errors & Omissions lines of business in those underwriting years. The reserve increase related to the post - 2001 underwriting years, was primarily due to certain large individual claims affecting a number of lines including; Surety, Umbrella Liability and Errors & Omissions. Brian M. O'Hara, President and Chief Executive Officer of XL, stated: "This reserve strengthening is extremely disappointing." "With respect to the reserve increase in Workers' Compensation, I do not believe this represents a broader issue for this line of business for XL given the unique nature of the program with the single cedent. Putting this reserve strengthening in the context of XL's overall financial strength, the reserve addition for non-Workers' Compensation lines represents only 1%, and the Workers' Compensation addition represents 0.5%, of XL's net loss reserves, respectively, as at March 31, 2005. In addition, in my judgement, the recent claims reporting activity reflects cedents having to recognize losses on their books with greater transparency and timeliness. Finally, I believe that we are benefiting from the changes we implemented in the North American reinsurance book since 2003, with respect to cedent communication and an increased number of on site claims audits." Mr. O'Hara added: "The post - 2001 underwriting year reserve additions do not alter XL's view of the continuing strong profitability in these lines of business in these years." The Company will post additional information on the Company's Investor Relations section of the website located at www.xlcapital.com and will hold a conference call on Friday, July 8, 2005 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to discuss the North American reinsurance operations reserve increases in more detail.
