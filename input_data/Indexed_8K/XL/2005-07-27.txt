Scotton Investor Relations Media Contact (441) 294-7345 (441) 294-7165 XL CAPITAL LTD REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2005 NET INCOME OF $135.9 MILLION, OR $0.97 PER ORDINARY SHARE First-Half 2005 Net Income of $578.8 million, or $4.14 per ordinary share HAMILTON, BERMUDA, July 27, 2005 -- XL Capital Ltd ("XL" or the "Company") (NYSE: XL) today reported net income available to ordinary shareholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 of $135.9 million, or $0.97 per ordinary share, compared with $363.6 million, or $2.62 per ordinary share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Annualized net income return on ordinary shareholders' equity for the quarter was 7.2% compared with 21.7% for the year ago quarter. 'Net income excluding net realized gains and losses'(1) for the quarter was $101.3 million, or $0.72 per ordinary share, compared with $319.9 million, or $2.31 per ordinary share, for the year ago quarter. Annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity on the same basis was 5.3% compared with 19.1% for the year ago quarter. See below for a reconciliation of 'net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax' to net income available to ordinary shareholders. Included in both net income and 'net income excluding net realized gains and losses'(1) in the quarter is a charge of $63.3 million, after tax, relating to an increase in future policy benefit reserves and a write off of deferred acquisition costs with respect to certain novated blocks of U.S.-based term-life mortality reinsurance business. In addition, these results also include the previously announced prior year reserve strengthening for the Company's North American Reinsurance operations of $186.3 million, after tax.
Commenting on these results, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. O'Hara said: "While the two reserve actions in the quarter are extremely disappointing, I am very pleased to see the strong underwriting results of XL's underlying general insurance and reinsurance operations as reflected in their combined ratio which, excluding the reserve increase, was 86.8%. This quarter we also closed a U.K. annuity reinsurance transaction which contributed $1.8 billion of premium and is the largest such transaction concluded to date in our ongoing life reinsurance business. Net investment income increased substantially from last year's second quarter, although equity in investment affiliates generated a loss for the quarter. We concluded the quarter with record book value per ordinary share of $55.95, an 8% increase from December 31, 2004, and annualized net income return on ordinary shareholders' equity of 7% in the quarter and 15% for the half year despite the reserve charges." For the first half of 2005, net income available to ordinary shareholders was $578.8 million, or $4.14 per ordinary share, compared with $815.8 million or $5.88 per ordinary share in the first half of 2004. 'Net income excluding net realized gains and losses' for the same period was $447.8 million or $3.20 per ordinary share as compared with $652.5 million or $4.71 per ordinary share in the first half of 2004. Second Quarter 2005 Operating Highlights (versus second quarter of 2004, unless noted): o Total revenues up 30% to $4.1 billion o Combined ratio from general operations was 97.9%, or 86.8% excluding the reinsurance reserve increase o Net investment income from general operations increased 43% to $209.7 million, of which $28.6 million was attributable to the close-out of a structured credit investment o Cash flow from operations of $2.4 billion, or $3.2 billion including all structured and spread transactions up from $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively o Total net invested assets of $36.4 billion, up 12% from December 31, 2004 o Total assets of $53.3 billion, up 8% from December 31, 2004 o Record book value per ordinary share of $55.95, up from $51.98 at December 31, 2004 SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS: Insurance Operations Underwriting profit for the quarter was $149.9 million, an increase of 41% over the second quarter of 2004. Net premiums written were $1.1 billion, down 7% from last year's second quarter, driven by market conditions in certain lines and reinsurance commutations of $78.8 million in the prior year second quarter. The combined ratio of 88.7% represents a 1.2 point improvement over the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to a reduction in acquisition expenses. The 64.2% loss ratio in the quarter was essentially flat versus 64.1% in the second quarter of 2004.
Reinsurance Operations General Operations - Underwriting results were negatively impacted by the previously announced reserve increase in XL's North American Reinsurance operations of $186.3 million, after tax. The combined ratio was 112.2% or 83.9% excluding this reserve increase. This resulted in an underwriting loss of $104.5 million for the quarter. Net premiums written were $347.5 million, down 36% from the second quarter of 2004. Over 50% of this decrease was due to timing differences on gross and ceded premiums that negatively impacted the year over year net premiums written comparison by $104.4 million. Net premiums earned were down 7% reflecting lower net premiums written over the last twenty four months. Life and Annuity Operations - Net premiums written increased 96%. This reflects a $1.8 billion U.K. annuity reinsurance transaction in this quarter compared to a similar annuity transaction of $898 million in the second quarter of last year. There was a $55.9 million net loss from Life and Annuity Operations for the quarter that included a $37.4 million increase in policy benefit reserves and a $25.9 million write off of deferred acquisition costs with respect to certain novated blocks of U.S.-based term-life mortality reinsurance business. This charge was the result of the completion of the previously announced actuarial review of these blocks of business. These blocks were not written as part of XL's ongoing life reinsurance operations. Financial Products and Services Operations Underwriting profit and total contribution from this segment were $8.7 million and $34.6 million, respectively, in the quarter compared with $24.9 million and $55.8 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2004. Underwriting profit decreased mainly due to lower net earned premium and higher net incurred losses in the financial guaranty business versus last year's second quarter. Contribution from financial operations also declined in 2005 largely due to a $7.4 million net loss from financial affiliates and the segment's share of the loss from investment affiliates. Corporate Items Net investment income from general operations increased 43% over the second quarter of 2004 to $209.7 million, principally reflecting a year-over-year increase in net invested assets and the close out of a structured credit investment. There was a net loss from investment affiliates of $10.8 million as compared to net income of $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2004, due primarily to weaker performance in the alternative investment portfolio. Net realized gains on investments were $90.1 million in the quarter, compared with $8.8 million in the prior year period. Net unrealized gains on investments, net of tax, were $819.2 million at June 30, 2005 compared with $428.4 million at March 31, 2005. Total operating expenses in the quarter of $248.9 million were generally in line with the Company's run-rate expectation and compared with $247.7 million in the second quarter of 2004. The tax rate of 22.3% reflects the limited deductibility of the reserve charges taken during the second quarter of 2005. (1) Defined as "net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax" (herein referred to as "net income excluding net realized gains and losses"). Net income excluding net realized gains and losses is a non-GAAP measure. See the schedule entitled "Reconciliation" at the end of this release for a reconciliation of net income excluding net realized gains and losses to net income available to ordinary shareholders. # # #

XL CAPITAL LTD RECONCILIATION The following is a reconciliation of the Company's (i) net income available to ordinary shareholders to 'net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax' (which is a non-GAAP measure, the "Exclusions") and (ii) annualized return on shareholders' equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders' equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Note 1 : Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Note 2 : Defined as "net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax".
Comment on Regulation G This press release contains the presentation of (i) 'net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax' (the "Exclusions") and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions). These items are "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above. XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance. This presentation includes the use of "net income minus the Exclusions". Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy, credit and structured financial derivatives (discussed further below). Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XL's operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XL's financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit and structured financial derivatives, because XL generally holds its financial guaranty contracts written in derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guaranty business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance of XL's financial guaranty operations. Unlike these derivatives, XL's weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business. In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income, XL believes that showing net income exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income makes it much more
difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies who follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reason and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis. Return on average ordinary shareholders' equity ("ROE") (minus the Exclusions) is a widely used measure of any company's profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders' equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholder's equity. XL establishes target ROE's for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If XL's ROE return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, XL seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, XL's compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependant on the achievement of XL's performance goals to enhance shareholder value which include ROE.
