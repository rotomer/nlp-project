Scotton Investor Relations Media Relations (441) 294 7460 (441) 294 7165 XL CAPITAL LTD ANNOUNCES ESTIMATED LOSSES FROM THIRD QUARTER NATURAL CATASTROPHES Hamilton, Bermuda - October 25, 2005: XL Capital Ltd (NYSE:XL) ("XL" or the "Company") announced today that, based on current loss reports and estimates, it expects that pre-tax net losses arising from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will be approximately $1.16 billion and $263.6 million, respectively. The Company also expects that pre-tax net losses from other, previously announced, natural catastrophes in the third quarter will be approximately $89.7 million. After taking into account net reinstatement premiums and tax effects, the Company estimates net losses due to these third quarter catastrophes will be approximately $1.47 billion. These losses will adversely affect XL's third quarter and full year results. Excluding these third quarter catastrophe losses, the Company expects operating income(1) for the quarter to be broadly in line with consensus analyst estimates issued prior to Hurricane Katrina. After taking into account expected losses from these events, the Company now expects an operating loss(1) for full year 2005. The Company's loss estimates are based upon a review of contracts it believes are exposed to these events, loss reports received from brokers and cedants, industry loss models, and management's best judgment. The Company expects that the loss adjustment processes for Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita will be protracted due to the unprecedented complexity and scale of the events. The Company's loss estimates for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are consistent with first-party market loss estimates of $50-55 billion and $6-9 billion, respectively. However, the Company's loss estimates involve the exercise of considerable judgment and are accordingly subject to revision. Actual losses may differ materially from these estimates. Brian M. O'Hara, President and Chief Executive Officer of XL, commented: "These hurricanes are market changing events for our industry. We believe that we are well-positioned to serve our customers and expect to be an active lead participant in the upcoming renewal season. XL will take the steps necessary to maintain its fundamental financial strength." The Company intends to release its third quarter 2005 financial results after the close of regular stock market hours on Monday, October 31, 2005. A conference call to discuss the Company's results will be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, November 1, 2005. The conference call can be accessed through a listen-only dial-in number or through a live webcast. To listen to the conference call please dial 201-689-8320, password XL1101.
