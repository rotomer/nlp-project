HAMILTON, BERMUDA, October 31, 2005 -- XL Capital Ltd ("XL" or the "Company") (NYSE: XL) today reported a net loss to ordinary shareholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 of $1,049.2 million, or a loss of $7.53 per ordinary share, compared with net income of $22.5 million, or $0.16 per ordinary share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 included previously announced pre-tax net losses from Hurricane Katrina of $1,158.8 million, Hurricane Rita of $263.6 million and other natural catastrophes of $89.7 million. After taking into account net reinstatement premiums and tax effects, the net income impact of these third quarter catastrophes was $1,474.4 million. Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 included net losses of $420.2 million, net of tax, from catastrophes. See attached table for further details. "Net loss excluding net realized gains and losses"(1) for the quarter was $1,115.0 million, or $8.01 per ordinary share, compared with a loss of $31.2 million, or $0.23 per ordinary share, for the year ago quarter. See below for a reconciliation of "net loss excluding net realized gains and losses"(1) to net loss available to ordinary shareholders.
Commenting on these results, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. O'Hara said: "The third quarter's insured market catastrophe losses, which we estimate at $60 billion to $72 billion, were greater than our industry has seen in any previous calendar year. Our loss estimation process has embraced the extraordinary breadth, magnitude and complexity of these events." "First and foremost we would like to re-emphasize our commitment to maintain our financial strength and leadership position in catastrophe exposed lines of business," he continued. "In the wake of these catastrophes, we expect to see significant opportunities across the board, especially in these lines, for the 2006 renewal season". "In addition, we are pleased to announce a strategic initiative that will augment our underwriting capacity to take advantage of these opportunities. XL has agreed in principle to enter into a quota share reinsurance treaty with a newly formed reinsurance company. This company will be funded with $500 million to $1 billion of dedicated capital from its parent holding company, which, in turn, will be owned by a group of institutional investors. The lead investor in this company is expected to be investment funds managed by an alternative asset manager with which XL has had a long-standing relationship. XL will not be an equity investor in this new company. Under this agreement, XL expects to cede to this company specified portions of XL's property catastrophe and retrocessional lines of business. We believe that this treaty will reinforce XL's leadership position in these lines of business, reduce our volatility, provide incremental earnings, and therefore maximize our shareholders' risk adjusted return." For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, net loss to ordinary shareholders was $470.4 million, or a loss of $3.39 per ordinary share, compared with net income of $838.2 million or $6.05 per ordinary share for the nine months of 2004. "Net loss excluding net realized gains and losses"(1) for the first nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $667.2 million or a loss of $4.81 per ordinary share as compared with "net income excluding net realized gains and losses"(1) of $621.3 million or $4.49 per ordinary share for the first nine months of 2004. Total net invested assets were $37.2 billion, up 15% from December 31, 2004, and total assets were $54.9 billion, up 11% from December 31, 2004.
Segment Highlights: Insurance Operations Underwriting loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was $625.7 million as compared with a loss of $85.9 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2004. These results included the net impact of third quarter catastrophes of $751.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively. See attached table for further details. Third quarter 2005 as compared with third quarter 2004 results excluding the impact of catastrophes in both quarters: o Gross premiums written were down slightly, due to competitive market pressure in most lines of business partially offset by growth in excess casualty lines. o Net premiums written were $916.0 million, up 1.9%, due primarily to increased net retentions. o Net premiums earned decreased, reflecting the earned impact of decreasing premium rates over the last twelve months. o The combined ratio was 88.5%, a 3.5 point improvement, largely due to lower acquisition expenses from reduced brokerage costs and a lower loss ratio. The loss ratio was 63.6%, an improvement of 1.4 points, due mainly to prior year net reserve strengthening in 2004. Reinsurance Operations General Operations - Underwriting loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was $738.2 million as compared with a loss of $76.6 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2004. These results included the net impact of third quarter catastrophes of $802.3 million and $245.9 million, respectively. See attached table for further details. Third quarter 2005 as compared with third quarter 2004 results excluding the impact of catastrophes in both quarters: o Gross and net premiums written were up 13.9% and 11.5%, respectively driven primarily by timing differences, reported last quarter, on assumed and ceded premiums related to two large contracts. o Net premiums earned were down 10.6% representing lower net premiums written over the last twenty four months. o The combined ratio was 89.1% as compared with 79.5%, due mainly to a higher loss ratio. The loss ratio increased primarily due to the impact of relatively lower premium rates together with other non catastrophe losses.
Life and Annuity Operations - Gross premiums written increased 3.8% as a result of continued growth in the term assurance business. Net income was $11.2 million, an increase of $6.9 million from the third quarter of 2004. Financial Products and Services Operations Total contribution and underwriting income for the segment were $51.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in the third quarter 2005 as compared with a $0.3 million contribution and $29.6 million underwriting loss in the third quarter of 2004. Underwriting profit in the third quarter of 2005 included a $21.4 million net loss from Hurricane Katrina that arose from the XL Financial Solutions business. Total contribution in the third quarter of 2005 was driven largely by favorable performance in the quarter in XL Financial Solutions' structured finance business and the year over year increase in net invested assets related to municipal GIC and funding agreement issuances. Corporate Items Net investment income from general operations increased 17% over the third quarter of 2004 to $184.1 million principally due to a higher investment base and yields. Net income from investment affiliates increased to $56.7 million as compared with $5.2 million in the third quarter of 2004, due primarily to strong performance in the alternative fund affiliates. Net realized gains on investments were $53.2 million in the quarter, compared with $57.0 million in the prior year period. Net unrealized gains on investments, net of tax, were $551.6 million at September 30, 2005 compared with $819.2 million at June 30, 2005 primarily reflecting the increase in overall interest rates in the quarter. Total operating expenses in the quarter were $262.3 million compared with $271.9 million in the third quarter of 2004. The third quarter of 2005 and 2004 effective tax rates reflect the limited deductibility of the catastrophe losses. # # # The Company will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2005 results on November 1, 2005 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.

XL Capital Ltd Reconciliation The following is a reconciliation of the Company's (i) net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders to 'net income (loss) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax' (which is a non-GAAP measure, the "Exclusions") and (ii) annualized return on shareholders' equity (based on net income (loss) minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders' equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Note 1 : Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Note 2 : Defined as "net income (loss) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax".
Comment on Regulation G This press release contains the presentation of (i) 'net (loss) income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax' and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders' equity. These items are "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above. XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance. This presentation includes the use of 'net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivatives, net of tax'. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below). Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XL's operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XL's financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL generally holds its financial guarantee contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance of XL's financial guarantee operations. Unlike these credit derivatives, XL's weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business. In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing net income (loss) exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes
performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies who follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis. Return on average ordinary shareholder's equity ("ROE"), excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax (the "Exclusions"), is a widely used measure of any company's profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders' equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholder's equity. The Company establishes target ROE's for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Company's ROE return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, the Company's compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependant on the achievement of the Company's performance goals to enhance shareholder value, which include ROE. (1) Defined as "net loss excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax" (herein referred to as "net loss excluding net realized gains and losses". Net loss excluding net realized gains and losses is a non-GAAP measure. See the scheduled entitled "Reconciliation" at the end of this release for a reconciliation of net loss excluding net realized gains and losses to net loss available to ordinary shareholders.
