Scotton Investor Relations Media Relations (441) 294-7460 (441) 294-7165 XL CAPITAL LTD ANNOUNCES RECEIPT OF DRAFT REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT ACTUARY REGARDING WINTERTHUR INTERNATIONAL NET RESERVE AND PREMIUM SEASONING HAMILTON, BERMUDA - November 23, 2005 - XL Capital Ltd ("XL" or the "Company") (NYSE: XL) announced today that it received a draft actuarial report from the Independent Actuary in connection with XL's post-closing protection for adverse development of net loss and unearned premium relating to XL's acquisition of certain Winterthur International insurance operations from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company ("WSIC") in 2001. Initial review of the Independent Actuary's draft report indicates that the Independent Actuary has determined that WSIC's submitted Seasoned Net Reserve Amount ("SNRA") and Net Premium Receivable Amount ("NPRA") are closest to the Independent Actuary's determinations of SNRA and NPRA. These determinations, if made final as described further below, would result in XL receiving a net lump sum payment in the amount of approximately $575 million (including interest receivable) from WSIC. The Independent Actuary has indicated to the parties that he intends his draft report to be final absent manifest errors. The parties have been advised by the Independent Actuary that he will revise the draft report for any manifest errors brought to his attention by the parties and finalize the report by December 5, 2005 (after the close of regular market hours on the NYSE). The Independent Actuary's report and the determinations therein become final on such date under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, as amended, between XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and WSIC (the "SPA"). Under the terms of the SPA, the amounts due to XL as described above are payable within five business days of the Independent Actuary's report becoming final. Accordingly, absent manifest errors in the draft report as described above,
an aggregate of $575 million (including interest as described above) will be due to XL from WSIC by December 12, 2005. If the draft report is finalized in the time period described above, XL would expect to record a loss of approximately $830 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 relating to the independent actuarial process. XL Capital Ltd, through its operating subsidiaries, is a leading provider of insurance and reinsurance coverages and financial products and services to industrial, commercial and professional service firms, insurance companies and other enterprises on a worldwide basis. As of September 30, 2005, XL Capital Ltd had consolidated assets of approximately $54.9 billion and consolidated shareholders' equity of approximately $7.0 billion.

Exhibit 99.2 [XL Capital Logo Omitted] XL Capital Ltd XL House One Bermudiana Road P. O. Box HM 2245 Hamilton HM JX Bermuda Phone: (441) 292-8515 Fax: (441) 292-5280 Press Release Contact: David Radulski Roger R. Scotton Investor Relations Media Relations (441) 294-7460 (441) 294-7165 XL CAPITAL LTD COMMENTS ON INDEPENDENT ACTUARY'S DRAFT REPORT REGARDING WINTERTHUR INTERNATIONAL AND ON PLANNED CAPITAL INITIATIVES Hamilton, Bermuda - November 25, 2005: XL Capital Ltd (NYSE:XL) ("XL" or the "Company") President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. O'Hara commented today on the previously announced draft report of the Independent Actuary ("IA") appointed in connection with the Company's acquisition of Winterthur International ("WI") from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company ("Winterthur Swiss") in 2001 and XL's planned capital initiatives. "While extremely disappointing, the IA's draft report removes the uncertainty that has existed since the IA review process began," Mr. O'Hara said. "The IA draft report, which we are still reviewing for manifest errors, requires Winterthur Swiss to pay XL $575 million (including interest) for the net losses and unearned premium balances relating to the acquired business and is expected to result in XL recording a net charge of approximately $830 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. I do believe, however, that this draft report reinforces the soundness of XL's reserving policies and practices on this book. "The WI acquisition is both a strategic and a financial success, irrespective of the IA process," Mr. O'Hara continued. "The outcome should be viewed in the context of the final cost of the Winterthur International acquisition," Mr. O'Hara commented. While XL paid $330 million for the Winterthur International business in 2001, the Company now expects to receive $575 million (including interest) from Winterthur Swiss as a result of the IA draft report as payment for the seasoning of reserves and unearned premiums for business in force prior to the acquisition date.
"The original transaction was completed just ahead of a major hardening of the market for property and casualty insurance. The acquisition was a critical strategic milestone in XL's development as a global company. It gave us the valuable competitive advantages of a global network, strong customer relationships and intellectual capital. The assets, resources and reach of the Winterthur International business allowed us to optimize the growth opportunities we have seen since 2001," Mr. O'Hara added. "Winterthur International has been a significant generator of run-rate profitability to XL over the past four years as we have successfully integrated and built upon the business and network we acquired in 2001. Viewing Winterthur International on a stand-alone basis, I believe the net cost to XL of the WI purchase continues to represent an attractive price to earnings multiple." Mr. O'Hara continued: "We are working with rating agencies and our advisers, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking, to determine the amount and form of our capital raising. We expect these deliberations will allow us to reach a timely conclusion on next steps. XL intends to execute on this strategy as quickly as possible. Our planned capital raising will have significant equity content and will be in an amount sufficient to redress the capital impact of the IA's draft report and the recent catastrophes, respond to rating agency requirements, and, importantly, support our growth in 2006. We have stated previously that we are committed to raising the capital we need to restore the strength of our balance sheet." "XL's previously announced property-catastrophe quota-share strategic initiative is on track. Our quota share counter-party, Cyrus Re, has recently obtained a Bermuda Monetary License to act as a reinsurer of XL property catastrophe and retrocessional business and has initially funded a collateral trust with $500 million to support such reinsurance activities." Mr. O'Hara concluded: "With the combination of our global platforms and strong underwriting capabilities, planned capital raising, Cyrus Re quota share and our risk management initiatives, XL is well-positioned to lead in the upcoming renewal season while producing risk-adjusted profitability for our shareholders." # # # This announcement shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale of securities would be unlawful.
