The Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the Lender, and such Account Party may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers. An Alternative Currency Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Alternative Currency Letter of Credit the Account Parties shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the Credit Exposure shall not exceed the amount of the Commitment. Each such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit shall be issued, and subsequently, renewed, extended, amended and confirmed, on such terms as XL Capital, the applicable Account Party and the Lender shall agree, including expiry, drawing conditions, reimbursement, interest, fees and provision of cover; provided that the expiry of any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit shall not be later than the one-year anniversary from the date of issuance thereof (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one-year after such renewal or extension). SECTION 2.03. Reimbursement of LC Disbursements, Etc. (a) Reimbursement. If the Lender shall make any LC Disbursement, regardless of the identity of the Account Party of such Letter of Credit, the Account Parties jointly and severally agree that they shall reimburse the Lender in respect of such LC Disbursement under (x) a Dollar Letter of Credit, by paying to the Lender an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Account Parties receive notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Account Parties receive such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time and (y) an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, by paying the Lender on the date, in the currency and amount thereof, together with interest thereon (if any), and in the manner (including the place of payment) as the Lender and such Account Party shall have separately agreed pursuant to Section 2.02. (b) Reimbursement Obligations Absolute. The Account Parties' joint and several obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section shall be abso- -14-
lute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit (provided that the Account Parties shall not be obligated to reimburse such LC Disbursements unless payment is made against presentation of a draft or other document that at least substantially complies with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iv) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Account Party, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of such reimbursement obligations of any other Account Party shall be waived, extended or renewed, (v) any of such reimbursement obligations of any other Account Party being amended or otherwise modified in any respect, or any guarantee of any of such reimbursement obligations being released, substituted or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with, (vi) the occurrence of any Default, (vii) the existence of any proceedings of the type described in clause (g) or (h) of Article VIII with respect to any other Account Party or any guarantor of any of such reimbursement obligations, (viii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any of such reimbursement obligations against any other Account Party or any guarantor of any of such reimbursement obligations, or (ix) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of any Account Party hereunder. Neither the Lender nor any of its Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond their control; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Lender from liability to any Account Party to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Account Parties to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by any Account Party that are caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. The parties hereto expressly agree that: (i) the Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (ii) the Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the Lender when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing). -15-
(c) Disbursement Procedures. The Lender shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under any Letter of Credit. The Lender shall promptly after such examination notify each of the Account Parties by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment. The Lender will make any such LC Disbursement available to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account identified by such beneficiary in connection with such demand for payment. Promptly following any LC Disbursement by the Lender in respect of any Letter of Credit, the Lender will notify the Account Parties of such LC Disbursement; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Account Parties of their obligation to reimburse the Lender with respect to any such LC Disbursement, (d) Interim Interest. If any LC Disbursement with respect to a Letter of Credit is made, then, unless the Account Parties shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Account Parties reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum equal to (i) 1% plus the Alternate Base Rate to but excluding the date three Business Days after such LC Disbursement is made and (ii) from and including the date three Business Days after such LC Disbursement is made, 3% plus the Alternate Base Rate. (e) Right of Contribution. The Account Parties hereby agree, as between themselves, that if any Account Party shall pay any reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement with respect to a Letter of Credit issued to support the obligations of another Account Party (the "Specified Account Party"), the Specified Account Party shall, on demand (but subject to the next sentence), pay to such first Account Party an amount equal to the amount of such reimbursement. The payment obligation of a Specified Account Party to another Account Party under this paragraph (e) shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of the Specified Account Party under this Agreement and each other Credit Document, and such other Account Party shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such reimbursement until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations of the Specified Account Party. SECTION 2.04. Loans and Borrowings. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Lender agrees to make Loans to an Account Party from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in (i) the Lender's outstanding Loans exceeding the RC Sublimit and (ii) the Credit Exposure exceeding the aggregate amount of the Commitment. Loans may be made, or be outstanding, to more than one of the Account Parties at any time. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Account Parties may borrow, prepay and reborrow Loans. (b) Type of Loans. Subject to Section 2.12, each Borrowing shall be constituted entirely of ABR Loans or of Eurodollar Loans as any Account Party may request in accordance herewith. The Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of the Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Account Parties to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. -16-
(c) Minimum Amounts; Limitation on Number of Borrowings. Each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000. Each ABR Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount equal to $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000; provided that an ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the Commitment or that is requested to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.03(a). Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of ten Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding. (d) Limitations on Interest Periods. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Account Party shall be entitled to request (or to elect to convert to or continue as a Eurodollar Borrowing) any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested therefor would end after the Maturity Date. SECTION 2.05. Requests for Borrowings. (a) Notice by the Account Parties. To request a Borrowing, XL Capital shall notify the Lender of such request by telephone (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three (3) Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (ii) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of an ABR Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.03(a) may be given not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Lender of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Lender and signed by XL Capital. (b) Content of Borrowing Requests. Each telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.04: (i) the relevant Account Party; (ii) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing; (iii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; (iv) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; (v) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period" and permitted under Section 2.04(d); and (vi) the location and number of such Account Party's account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06. (c) Failure to Elect. If no election as to the Type of a Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the requested Borrowing shall be made instead as an ABR Borrowing. -17-
SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. The Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time (or 1:00 p.m., New York City time with respect to ABR Loans requested by XL Capital no later than 11:00 a.m. on the same day), available to the relevant Account Party by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Account Party maintained with the Lender in New York City and designated by such Account Party in the applicable Borrowing Request. SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Elections by the Account Parties. The Loans constituting each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the relevant Account Party may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section. The relevant Account Party may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. (b) Notice of Elections. To make an election pursuant to this Section, XL Capital shall notify the Lender of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.05 if XL Capital were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Lender of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Lender and signed by XL Capital. (c) Content of Interest Election Requests. Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.04: (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period" and permitted under Section 2.04(d). (d) Failure to Elect; Events of Default. If XL Capital fails to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provi- -18-
sion hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Lender so notifies XL Capital, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period therefor. SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of the Commitment. (a) Scheduled Termination. Unless previously terminated, the Commitment shall terminate at the close of business on the Commitment Termination Date. (b) Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Account Parties may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitment and/or RC Sublimit; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitment or RC Sublimit shall be in an amount that is $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of $5,000,000 and (ii) the Account Parties shall not terminate or reduce the Commitment or RC Sublimit if the Credit Exposure would exceed the Commitment or the outstanding Loans would exceed the RC Sublimit, as the case may be. XL Capital shall notify the Lender of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitment or RC Sublimit under this paragraph (b) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof, provided that no reduction of the RC Sublimit shall occur in connection with a reduction of the Commitment unless specified in such notice, except that upon the earlier of (x) the termination of the Commitment and (y) the Commitment Termination Date, the RC Sublimit shall be reduced to zero. Each notice delivered by XL Capital pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitment delivered by XL Capital may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by XL Capital (by notice to the Lender on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Subject to the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, any termination or reduction of the Commitment or the RC Sublimit shall be permanent. SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Term-Out Option; Evidence of Debt. (a) Repayment. Each Account Party hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Lender, (i) in the event that the Term-Out Option has not been exercised, the outstanding principal amount of the Loans made to such Account Party on the Commitment Termination Date and (ii) in the event that the Term-Out Option has been exercised and is in effect, the outstanding principal amount of the Loans made to such Account Party on the Maturity Date. (b) Term-Out Option. The Account Parties may, by notice given by XL Capital to the Lender not less than 15 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date, extend the Maturity Date for all Loans outstanding at the close of business New York City time on the Commitment Termination Date to the first anniversary of the Commitment Termination Date (the "Term-Out Option"); provided that such extension shall not be effective with respect to the Lender unless: (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on each of the date of the notice requesting such extension and on the Commitment Termination Date; and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Obligors set forth in this Agreement (other than in Section 4.04(b)) shall be true and correct on and as of each of the date of the notice -19-
requesting such extension and the Commitment Termination Date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date). Such notice shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by XL Capital as to the matters specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence as of each such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Commitment of the Lender to make Loans shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date. (c) Manner of Payment. Prior to any repayment or prepayment of any Borrowings hereunder, XL Capital shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be paid and shall notify the Lender by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment; provided that each repayment of Borrowings shall be applied to repay any outstanding ABR Borrowings before any other Borrowings. If XL Capital fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied, first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings and, second, to other Borrowings in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Each payment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in such Borrowing. (d) Maintenance of Records by Lender. The Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of each Account Party to the Lender resulting from each Loan made by the Lender to such Account Party, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to the Lender from time to time hereunder. The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of the Lender to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Account Parties to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e) Promissory Notes. The Lender may request that Loans made by it to any Account Party be evidenced by a promissory note of such Account Party. In such event, each Account Party shall prepare, execute and deliver to the Lender a promissory note payable to the Lender (or, if requested by the Lender, to the Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) Right to Prepay Borrowings. The Account Parties shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this Section. (b) Notices, Etc. XL Capital shall notify the Lender by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Busi- -20-
ness Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitment as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.04. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and shall be made in the manner specified in Section 2.09(c). SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. XL Capital agrees to pay to the Lender a facility fee which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate, (i) prior to the termination of the Lender's Commitment, on the daily amount of such Commitment (whether used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the earlier of the date on which such Commitment terminates and the Commitment Termination Date and (ii) if the Lender continues to have any Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, on the daily amount of the Lender's Credit Exposure from and including the date on which the Lender's Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which the Lender ceases to have any Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable on each Quarterly Date and on (i) in the event the Term-Out Option has not been exercised, the earlier of the date the Commitment terminates and the Commitment Termination Date or (ii) in the event the Term-Out Option has been exercised and is in effect, on the Maturity Date; provided that any facility fees accruing after such earlier date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be, shall be payable on demand. (b) Letter of Credit Fees. XL Capital agrees to pay to the Lender a letter of credit fee which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Letter of Credit Fee Rate on the average daily aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which the Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which the Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure. Letter of Credit fees accrued through and including each Quarterly Date shall be payable on the third Business Day following such Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitment terminates and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitment terminates shall be payable on demand. (c) Payment and Computation of Fees. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Lender entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. All fees payable under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) ABR Loans. The Loans constituting each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Additional Margin, if any. -21-
(b) Eurodollar Loans. The Loans constituting each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin plus the Applicable Additional Margin, if any. (c) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable (other that in respect of any LC Disbursement under Section 2.03(d)) by the Account Parties hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section. (d) Payment of Interest. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable by the applicable Account Party in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon (i) in the event the Term-Out Option has not been exercised, the date the Commitment terminates or (ii) in the event the Term-Out Option has been exercised and is in effect, the Maturity Date; provided that (x) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (y) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the later of the Commitment Termination Date and the Maturity Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (z) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Borrowing shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. (e) Computation. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Lender, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of the Interest Period for any Eurodollar Borrowing, the Lender determines in good faith that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining its respective Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period, then the Lender shall give notice thereof to XL Capital by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Lender notifies XL Capital that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or the continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be continued as, or converted to, an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing. SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for account of, or credit extended by, the Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or -22-
(ii) impose on the Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement, any Letter of Credit (or any participation therein) or any Eurodollar Loan made by the Lender; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining, or participating in, any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining any participation therein) or Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Account Parties jointly and severally agree that they will pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Capital Requirements. If the Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the Lender's capital or on the capital of the Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Letters of Credit issued or participated in, or the Loans made, by the Lender to a level below that which the Lender or the Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration the Lender's policies and the policies of the Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Account Parties will pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender or the Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Certificates from Lender. A certificate of the Lender setting forth the Lender's good faith determination of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to XL Capital and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Account Parties shall pay the Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof by XL Capital. (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of the Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of the Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Account Parties shall not be required to compensate the Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that the Lender notifies XL Capital of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of the Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. (e) Application to Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, this Section shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed solely by Section 2.16. SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor or (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith), then, in any such event, the Account Parties shall compensate the Lender for the loss attributable to such event. The loss to the Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to be an amount determined by the Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that the Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the princi- -23-
pal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that the Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if the Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by the Lender (or an affiliate of the Lender) for Dollar deposits from other banks in the eurodollar market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of the Lender setting forth the Lender's good faith determination of any amount or amounts that the Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to XL Capital and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Account Parties shall pay the Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof by XL Capital. SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Account Parties hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes; provided that if any Account Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Account Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Account Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Account Parties. In addition, each Account Party shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Indemnification by the Account Parties. The Account Parties shall indemnify the Lender, within 10 days after written demand to XL Capital therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Lender and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, as the case may be, were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth the Lender's good faith determination of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to XL Capital by the Lender, shall be conclusive as between the Lender and the Account Parties absent manifest error. (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Account Party to a Governmental Authority, XL Capital on behalf of such Account Party shall deliver to the Lender the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Lender. (e) Exemptions. The Lender shall, at the written request of XL Capital, provide to any Account Party such form, certification or similar documentation, if any (each duly completed, accurate and signed) as is currently required by any Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, or -24-
comply with such other requirements, if any, as is currently applicable in such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, in order to obtain an exemption from, or reduced rate of, deduction, payment or withholding of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to which the Lender is entitled pursuant to an applicable tax treaty or the law of such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction; provided that XL Capital shall have furnished to the Lender in a reasonably timely manner copies of such documentation and notice of such requirements together with applicable instructions. Upon the reasonable request of XL Capital in writing, the Lender will provide to XL Capital such form, certification or similar documentation (each duly completed, accurate and signed) as may in the future be required by any Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, or comply with such other requirements, if any, as may be applicable in such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction in order to obtain an exemption from, or reduced rate of, deduction, payment or withholding of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to which the Lender is entitled pursuant to an applicable tax treaty or the law of the relevant jurisdiction. The Account Parties shall not be required to pay additional amount to, or to indemnify, the Lender under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes would not have been imposed but for the failure by the Lender to comply with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (e). (f) If the Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by an Account Party or with respect to which an Account Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay over such refund to such Account Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Account Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that such Account Party, upon the request of the Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Account Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender in the event the Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Account Party or any other Person. SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (a) Payments by the Account Parties. The Account Parties shall make each payment required to be made by them hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, interest or fees, or under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) or under any other Credit Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim; provided that any payments in respect of Alternative Currency Letters of Credit shall be made in the manner (including the time and place of payment) as shall have been separately agreed between the relevant Account Party and Lender pursuant to Section 2.02. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Lender, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Lender at its offices at 60 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005, except payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. -25-
(b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Lender to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder. SECTION 2.18. Designation of a Different Lending Office. If the Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Account Party is required to pay any additional amount or indemnification payment to the Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of the Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then the Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans and/or Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of the Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject the Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to the Lender. Each Account Party hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. ARTICLE III GUARANTEE SECTION 3.01. The Guarantee. Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally guarantees to the Lender and its respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans and LC Disbursements (and interest thereon) made by the Lender to each of the Account Parties (other than such Guarantor in its capacity as an Account Party hereunder) and all other amounts from time to time owing to the Lender by such Account Parties under this Agreement, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof (such obligations being herein collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Each Guarantor hereby further jointly and severally agrees that if any Account Party (other than such Guarantor in its capacity as an Account Party hereunder) shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, such Guarantor will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. SECTION 3.02. Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 3.01 are absolute and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the obligations of the Account Parties under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Article that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, joint and several, under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above: -26-
(i) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obliga- tions shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived; (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein shall be done or omitted; or (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with. The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Account Party under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations. SECTION 3.03. Reinstatement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Account Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Guarantors jointly and severally agree that they will indemnify the Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by the Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. SECTION 3.04. Subrogation. The Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree that until the payment and satisfaction in full of all Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitment they shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of any performance by them of their guarantee in Section 3.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against any Account Party or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. SECTION 3.05. Remedies. The Guarantors jointly and severally agree that, as between the Guarantors and the Lender, the obligations of the Account Parties under this Agreement may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VIII (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Article VIII) for purposes of Section 3.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any Account Party and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by any Account Party) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 3.01. SECTION 3.06. Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Article is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising. -27-
SECTION 3.07. Rights of Contribution. The Guarantors (other than XL Capital) hereby agree, as between themselves, that if any such Guarantor shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor (as defined below) by reason of the payment by such Guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations, each other Guarantor (other than XL Capital) shall, on demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but subject to the next sentence), pay to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount equal to such Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (as defined below and determined, for this purpose, without reference to the properties, debts and liabilities of such Excess Funding Guarantor) of the Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations. The payment obligation of a Guarantor to any Excess Funding Guarantor under this Section shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Article III and such Excess Funding Guarantor shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such excess until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations. For purposes of this Section, (i) "Excess Funding Guarantor" means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, a Guarantor that has paid an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) "Excess Payment" means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, the amount paid by an Excess Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations and (iii) "Pro Rata Share" means, for any Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (x) the amount by which the aggregate present fair saleable value of all properties of such Guarantor (excluding any shares of stock of any other Guarantor) exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder and any obligations of any other Guarantor that have been Guaranteed by such Guarantor) to (y) the amount by which the aggregate fair saleable value of all properties of all of the Guarantors (other than XL Capital) exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Guarantors under this Article III) of all of the Guarantors (other than XL Capital), determined (A) with respect to any Guarantor that is a party hereto on the date hereof, as of the date hereof, and (B) with respect to any other Guarantor, as of the date such Guarantor becomes a Guarantor hereunder. SECTION 3.08. General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any action or proceeding involving any corporate law, or any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 3.01 would otherwise, taking into account the provisions of Section 3.07, be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 3.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor, the Lender or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding.

No failure or delay by the Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Lender hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Account Parties therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, -44-
the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. (b) Amendments. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Obligors and the Lender. SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) Costs and Expenses. The Account Parties jointly and severally agree to pay all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of one legal counsel for the Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including in connection with any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof. Indemnification by the Account Parties. The Account Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Lender and its Related Party (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee (but not including Excluded Taxes), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof or any Letter of Credit or the use thereof (including any refusal by the Lender to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by any Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to any Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses result from or arise out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. (b) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Account Party shall assert, and each Account Party hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. (c) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor. -45-
SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) Assignments Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no party hereto may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto (and any attempted assignment or transfer by an Account Party without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Lender) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Certain Pledges. The Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of the Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release the Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for the Lender as a party hereto. SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Account Parties herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and the issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of, or any accrued interest on, any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitment has not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the expiration or termination of the Commitment or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Lender constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Lender and when the Lender shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. -46-
SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Account Party against any of and all the obligations of such Account Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by the Lender, irrespective of whether or not the Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of the Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which the Lender may have. SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. (a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. (b) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Obligor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. (c) Waiver of Venue. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (d) Service of Process. By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, XL Capital, XL Insurance and XL Re acknowledge that they have by a separate written instrument, designated and appointed CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, 13th floor, New York, New York 10011 (or any successor entity thereto), as its authorized agent upon which process may be served in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement that may be instituted in any federal or state court in the State of New York. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in -47-
the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. (e) Waiver of Immunities. To the extent that any Account Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution or execution, on the ground of sovereignty or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, it hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement. SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. SECTION 9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. SECTION 9.12. Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. (a) Treatment of Certain Information. Each of the Account Parties acknowledge that from time to time financial advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or provided to any Account Party or one or more of their Subsidiaries (in connection with this Agreement or otherwise) by the Lender or by one or more of its subsidiaries or affiliates and each of the Account Parties hereby authorizes the Lender to share any information delivered to it by such Account Party and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of the Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or affiliate, it being understood that (i) any such information shall be used only for the purpose of advising the Account Parties or preparing presentation materials for the benefit of the Account Parties and (ii) any such subsidiary or affiliate receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such authorization shall survive the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit, the expiration or termination of the Commitment or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. (b) Confidentiality. The Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority (including self-regulating organizations) having jurisdiction over the Lender, -48-
(iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement in writing containing provisions substantially the same as those of this paragraph and for the benefit of the Account Parties, to (a) any assignee of, or any prospective assignee of, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (b) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to any Account Party and its obligations, (vii) with the consent of the Account Parties or (viii) to the extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this paragraph or (B) becomes available to the Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than an Account Party. For the purposes of this paragraph, "Information" means all information received from an Account Party relating to an Account Party or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by such Account Party; provided that, in the case of information received from an Account Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lender agrees that it will not trade the securities of any of the Account Parties based upon non-public Information that is received by it. SECTION 9.13. Judgment Currency. This is an international loan transaction in which the obligations of each Account Party under this Agreement to make payment hereunder shall be satisfied only in Dollars and only if such payment shall be made in New York City, and the obligations of each Account Party under this Agreement to make payment to (or for account of) the Lender in Dollars shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any other currency or in another place except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the Lender in New York City of the full amount of Dollars payable to the Lender under this Agreement. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency (in this Section called the "judgment currency"), the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Lender could purchase such Dollars at the principal office of the Lender in New York City with the judgment currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of each Account Party in respect of any such sum due from it to the Lender hereunder (in this Section called an "Entitled Person") shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder in the judgment currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer Dollars to New York City with the amount of the judgment currency so adjudged to be due; and each Account Party hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in Dollars, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such Entitled Person in Dollars hereunder exceeds the amount of the Dollars so purchased and transferred. SECTION 9.14. USA PATRIOT Act. The Lender hereby notifies the Account Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Account Parties, -49-
which information includes the name and address of the Account Parties and other information that will allow the Lender to identify each Account Party in accordance with said Act. -50-
