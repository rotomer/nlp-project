HAMILTON, BERMUDA, February 7, 2006  XL Capital Ltd (XL or the Company) (NYSE: XL) today reported a net loss to ordinary shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $821.9 million, or a net loss of $5.51 per ordinary share, compared with net income of $288.0 million, or net income of $2.07
 
per ordinary share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 included net losses of $834.2 million, pre and post tax, associated with the Winterthur International independent actuarial decision (Winterthur Decision). The quarter ended December 31, 2005 also included pre-tax net losses from Hurricane Wilma of $247.1 million and additional pre-tax net losses of $210.8 million related to the 2005 third quarter natural catastrophes. These additional net losses arose from newly reported claims and
 
increased severity on existing claims. Taking into account net reinstatement premiums and tax effects, the net income impact of Hurricane Wilma and the third quarter catastrophes in the fourth quarter 2005 was $225.6 million and $165.1 million respectively, for a total of $390.7 million. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 included net losses of $138.0 million, net of tax, from catastrophes. The Companys loss estimates involve the exercise of considerable judgment and are accordingly subject to revision. See attached table for further details.
 
Net loss excluding net realized gains and losses(1) for the quarter was $868.2 million, a net loss of $5.82 per ordinary share, compared with net income of $199.4 million, or net income of $1.43 per ordinary share, for the quarter a year ago. See below for a reconciliation of net income/loss excluding net realized gains and losses (1) to net loss to ordinary shareholders.
 
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, net loss to ordinary shareholders was $1,292.3 million, or a net loss of $9.14 per ordinary share, compared with net income of $1,126.3 million or net income of $8.13 per ordinary share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. Net loss excluding net realized gains and losses(1) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $1,535.4 million or a net loss of $10.86 per ordinary share compared with net income of $820.7 million or net income of $5.92 per ordinary share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.
 
The twelve months ended December 31, 2005 included a net loss of $1,865.1 million for the 2005 third and fourth quarter natural catastrophes, after taking into account net reinstatement premiums and tax effects. In addition, it also included a net loss of $808.9 million, net of interest received, associated with the Winterthur Decision. Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 included a net loss of $558.2 million related to the 2004 third and fourth quarter natural catastrophes.
 
At December 31, 2005, total net invested assets were $41.6 billion, up 28.4% from December 31, 2004, and total assets were $58.4 billion, up 19% from December 31, 2004.
 
Commenting on these results, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. OHara said: We are extremely disappointed with the impact the third and fourth quarters events had on our financial performance. However, the natural catastrophes of 2005 have led to more attractive markets, and in true XL tradition, we are executing on these opportunities with a focus on maximizing risk-adjusted returns. I believe that XLs solid balance sheet, geographic breadth and diversification of platforms will serve us well in 2006.

These results included the pre-tax net impact of catastrophes of $140.9 million and $39.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
Fourth quarter 2005 as compared with fourth quarter 2004 results (excluding the impact of natural catastrophes in both quarters):

These results included the pre-tax net impact of natural catastrophes of $943.2 million and $285.4 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. See attached table for further details.
 
Life and Annuity Operations
 Gross premiums written decreased 36.3% as a result of $97 million of long duration annuity premiums assumed in the fourth quarter of 2004 with no similar transaction occurring in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income was $9.8 million, an increase from $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 substantially
 
due to higher net investment income.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 as compared with 2004, gross premiums written increased 63% principally due to the $1.8 billion U.K. annuity reinsurance transaction assumed in the second quarter of 2005. Net loss for the 2005 year was $29.9 million as compared with net income of $28.4 million in 2004 due to the charge of $63.3 million in the second quarter 2005 for the increase in future policy benefit reserves and a write off of deferred acquisition costs on certain U.S.-based term-life mortality reinsurance business.
 
Financial Products and Services Operations
 
Underwriting profit for the segment rose to $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with $10.1 million in the fourth quarter 2004. Total contribution for the segment was $71.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with $46.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. This increase was driven largely by higher levels of business activity and higher net investment income due to a special dividend received from our joint venture with Financial Security Assurance. The year-over-year increase in net invested assets from municipal GIC and funding agreement issuances also added to total contribution in fourth quarter 2005.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2005, underwriting profit increased to $60.2 million as compared with $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to lower net losses. Total contribution for the segment was $234.8 million in 2005 compared with $141.1 million in 2004 mainly due to higher underwriting profits and an increase in financial guaranty investment income.
 
Corporate Items
 
Net investment income from general operations increased 42.3% over the fourth quarter of 2004 to $233.1 million due to a higher investment base, a rise in average yields, and $25.3 million of interest related to the $575 million payment received in connection with the Winterthur Decision. Net income from investment affiliates was $38.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with $47.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2005, net investment income from general operations (excluding interest received related to the Winterthur Decision and a structured credit transaction) was up 21% compared with 2004. Net income from investment affiliates was $154.8 million in 2005 compared with $124.0 million in 2004.
 
Net realized gains on investments were $37.9 million in the quarter, compared with $65.4 million in the prior year period. Net unrealized gains on investments, net of tax, were $396.2 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $551.6 million at September 30, 2005 primarily reflecting a rise in U.S. interest rates during the quarter.
 
Total operating expenses decreased to $224 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 from $288 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Total operating expenses decreased to $982 million in the 2005 year from $1,053 million in the 2004 year. This was primarily due to continued productivity and expense management efforts and adjustments in certain 2005 compensation costs associated with XLs pay-for-performance focus.

The following is a reconciliation of the Companys (i) net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders to net income (loss) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments
and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives
, net of tax (which is a non-GAAP measure, the Exclusions) and (ii) annualized return on shareholders equity (based on net income (loss) minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders equity for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004
($ in millions, except per share amounts)

Comment on Regulation G
This press release contains the presentation of (i) net (loss) income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders equity. These items are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above.
XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XLs financial information in evaluating XLs performance. This presentation includes the use of net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivatives, net of tax. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below).
Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XLs operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XLs financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL generally holds its financial guarantee contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance of XLs financial guarantee operations. Unlike these credit derivatives, XLs weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business.
In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing net income (loss) exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XLs financial information to analyze XLs performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XLs financial information to evaluate XLs underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies who follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.
Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (ROE), excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax (the Exclusions), is a widely used measure of any companys profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. The Company establishes target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Companys ROE return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, the Companys compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependant on the achievement of the Companys performance goals to enhance shareholder value which include ROE.
