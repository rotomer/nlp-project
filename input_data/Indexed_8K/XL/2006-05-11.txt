If requested by the Administrative Agent, such Account Party also shall submit a letter of credit application on JPMCBs standard form in connection with any request for a Syndicated Letter of Credit.

(e)
Application to Taxes
. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, this Section shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed solely by Section 2.10.
 
SECTION 2.10.
Taxes
.
 
(a)
Payments Free of Taxes
. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Account Parties hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes;
provided
that if any Account Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Account Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Account Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Account Parties

A certificate setting forth the Administrative Agents or such Lenders, as the case may be, good faith determination of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to XL Capital by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on
 
-27-
behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive as between such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and the Account Parties absent manifest error.
 
(d)
Evidence of Payments
. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Account Party to a Governmental Authority, XL Capital on behalf of such Account Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e)
Exemptions
. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall, at the written request of XL Capital, provide to any Account Party such form, certification or similar documentation, if any (each duly completed, accurate and signed) as is currently required by any Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, or comply with such other requirements, if any, as is currently applicable in such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, in order to obtain an exemption from, or reduced rate of, deduction, payment or withholding of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to which such Lender or the Administrative Agent is entitled pursuant to an applicable tax treaty or the law of such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction;
provided
that XL Capital shall have furnished to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in a reasonably timely manner copies of such documentation and notice of such requirements together with applicable instructions. Upon the reasonable request of XL Capital in writing, each Lender and the Administrative Agent will provide to XL Capital such form, certification or similar documentation (each duly completed, accurate and signed) as may in the future be required by any Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, or comply with such other requirements, if any, as may be applicable in such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction in order to obtain an exemption from, or reduced rate of, deduction, payment or withholding of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to which such Lender or the Administrative Agent is entitled pursuant to an applicable tax treaty or the law of the relevant jurisdiction. In addition, each Lender agrees from time to time when a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the previous documentation obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, it will deliver to the Account Parties such properly completed and executed documentation as will permit such payments to continue to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, or notify the Account Parties that it is unable to do so.
 
(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund from the relevant Governmental Authority (in cash or as an offset against another tax liability owing to such Governmental Authority) of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by an Account Party or with respect to which an Account Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay over such refund to such Account Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Account Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
that such Account Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Account Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall
 
-28-
not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes not expressly required to be made available hereunder which it reasonably deems confidential) to any Account Party or any other Person.
 
SECTION 2.11.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
.
 
(a)
Payments by the Account Parties

provided
that any payments in respect of Alternative Currency Letters of Credit shall be made in the manner (including the time and place of payment) as shall have been separately agreed between the relevant Account Party and Lender pursuant to Section 2.05. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments pursuant to Sections 2.09, 2.10 and 10.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
 
(b)
Application of Insufficient Payments
. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
 
(c)
Pro Rata Treatment
. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, each reimbursement of LC Disbursements (other than in respect of Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) shall be made to the relevant Lenders, each payment of fees under Section 2.07 shall be made for account of the relevant Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.06 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, in each case pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (or, in the case of any such reimbursement or payment after the termination of the Commitments, pro rata according to the Aggregate Credit Exposure).
 
(d)
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any of its LC Disbursements or interest thereon (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other relevant
 
-29-
Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) of such other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of the reimbursement obligations of and accrued interest on their respective LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit);
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Account Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Account Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Account Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Account Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Account Party in the amount of such participation.
 
(e)
Presumptions of Payment
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from an Account Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the relevant Lenders hereunder that such Account Party will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Account Party has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the relevant Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Account Party has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
 
(f)
Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent
. If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.11(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
 
SECTION 2.12.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
.
 
(a)
Designation of a Different Lending Office
. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.09, or if any Account Party is required to pay any additional amount or indemnification payment to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.10, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.09 or 2.10, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise
 
-30-
be disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Account Party hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b)
Replacement of Lenders
. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.09, or if any Account Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.10, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to make LC Disbursements hereunder, or if any Lender ceases to be a NAIC Approved Bank, then XL Capital may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee selected by XL Capital that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) XL Capital shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to its outstanding LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding LC Disbursements, accrued interest and fees) or the relevant Account Party (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.09 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.10, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the relevant Account Party to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

-52-
counsel for any Account Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.

Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by XL Capital to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between XL Capital and such successor. After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents named on the cover page of this Agreement shall not have any duties or liabilities under this Agreement, except in their capacity, if any, as Lenders.

that no consent of any Account Party shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (g) or (h) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and
(B) the Administrative Agent.
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Approved Fund or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Account Parties and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,
provided
that no such consent of the Account Parties shall be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (g) or (h) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing;
(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this
-57-
Agreement;
(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and
(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver an Administrative Questionnaire to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to XL Capital).
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(v) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obliga-tions under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.09, 2.10 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a 
Granting Lender
) may grant to a special purpose vehicle (an 
SPV
) of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Account Parties, the option to provide to the Account Parties all or any part of any LC Disbursement that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Account Parties pursuant to Section 2.01,
provided
that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any LC Disbursement, (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such LC Disbursement, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such LC Disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Account Parties may bring any proceeding against either or both the Granting Lender or the SPV in order to enforce any rights of the Account Parties hereunder. The making of a LC Disbursement by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such LC Disbursement were made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Lender makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof arising out of any claim against such SPV under this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any SPV may with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Account Parties or the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Letter of Credit to its
-58-
Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Account Parties and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support (if any) with respect to commercial paper issued by such SPV to issue such Letters of Credit and such SPV may disclose, on a confidential basis, confidential information with respect to any Account Party and its Subsidiaries to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit liquidity enhancement to such SPV. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no SPV shall be entitled to any greater rights under Section 2.09 or Section 2.10 than its Granting Lender would have been entitled to absent the use of such SPV. This paragraph may not be amended without the consent of any SPV at the time holding LC Disbursements under this Agreement.
(v) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Account Parties, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, the Commitment of, and the LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Account Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Account Party and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(vi) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b)(ii)(C) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b)(i) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c)
Participations
. (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Account Parties, the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the LC Disbursements owing to it);
provided
that (A) any such participation sold to a Participant which is not a Lender, an Approved Fund or a Federal Reserve Bank shall be made only with the consent (which in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld) of XL Capital and the Administrative Agent, unless a Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case the consent of XL Capital shall not be required, (B) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall remain unchanged, (C) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (D) the Account Parties, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to approve any amendment,
-59-
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Account Parties agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.09 and 2.10 (subject to the requirements of such Sections) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11(d) as though it were a Lender.
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.09 or 2.10 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant or the Lender interest assigned, unless (A) the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Account Parties prior written consent and (B) in the case of Section 2.09 or 2.10, the entitlement to greater payment results solely from a Change in Law formally announced after such Participant became a Participant.
(iii)
 
In the event that any Lender sells participations in a Commitment, such Lender, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a register on which it enters the name of all participants in the Commitments held by it (the 
Participant Register
). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error, and the participating Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the Participant for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
(d)  
Certain Pledges
. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(e)
No Assignments to Account Parties or Affiliates
. Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any interest in any LC Exposure held by it hereunder to any Account Party or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent of each Lender.
 
SECTION 10.05.
Survival
. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Account Parties herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any fee or any other amount payable under this
 
-60-
Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.09, 2.10 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
 
SECTION 10.06.
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness
. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 10.07.
Severability
. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
SECTION 10.08.
Right of Setoff
. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Account Party against any of and all the obligations of such Account Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

Such authorization shall survive the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
 
(b)
Confidentiality
. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and each SPV agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority (including self-regulating organizations) having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or any Lender (or any Affiliate thereof), (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement in writing containing provisions substantially the same as those of this paragraph and for the benefit of the Account Parties, to (a) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (b) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to any Account Party and its obligations, (vii) with the consent of the Account Parties or (viii) to the extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this paragraph or (B) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than an Account Party.

provided
that, in the case of information received from an Account Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.

This is an international loan transaction in which the obligations of each Account Party under this Agreement to make payment hereunder shall be satisfied only in Dollars and only if such payment shall be made in New York City, and the obligations of each Account Party under this Agreement to make payment to (or for account of) a Lender in Dollars shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any other currency or in another place except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by such Lender in New York City of the full amount of Dollars payable to such Lender under this Agreement. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency (in this Section called the 
judgment currency
), the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase such Dollars at the principal office of the Administrative Agent in New York City with the judgment currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of each Account Party in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (in this Section called an 
Entitled Person
) shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder in the judgment currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer Dollars to New York City with the amount of the judgment currency so adjudged to be due; and each Account Party hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in Dollars, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such Entitled Person in Dollars hereunder exceeds the amount of the Dollars so purchased and transferred.
SECTION 10.14.
USA PATRIOT Act
. Each Lender hereby notifies the Account Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub.

U.S.A.
Dear Sirs,
I am Executive Vice President and General Counsel of XL Capital Ltd and I am familiar with the affairs of XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd (collectively, the Account Parties and each an Account Party). I am furnishing this opinion to you pursuant to Section 5.01(b)(i) of the Credit Agreement dated as of May 9, 2006, between X.L. America, Inc. and the Account Parties, as account parties and guarantors, the Lenders parties thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the Agreement). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to those terms in the Agreement.
In this connection, I have examined the Agreement.
For purposes of this opinion I have been informed that you are receiving an opinion of Richard G. McCarty, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of X.L. America, Inc., and opinions of Cahill Gordon & Reindel
llp
, Conyers, Dill & Pearman and Appleby Spurling Hunter, special New York, Bermuda and Cayman Islands legal counsel, respectively, for the Account Parties, as to, among other things, the Account Parties each having all the requisite power and authority and having taken all necessary corporate or other action to execute and deliver (and having duly authorized, executed and delivered) the Agreement. I have not independently verified any of the matters contained in such opinions or made any investigations in connection with any such matters.
I have examined and relied upon the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Agreement, certificates of public officials and of other officers of each of the Account Parties and such other documents and records as I deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.
 
 
 
In rendering the opinions set forth below, I have assumed that the signatures on documents and instruments examined by me as originals are authentic and that all documents submitted to me as copies conform with the originals, which facts I have not independently verified.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions and qualifications set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
1.
 
To my knowledge after due inquiry, except as disclosed in XL Capital Ltds annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and as routinely encountered in claims activity, there is no litigation or governmental proceeding by or against any Account Party or any Subsidiary of any Account Party pending or threatened which could reasonably be expected (in light of reserves and total shareholder equity of such Account Party and after taking into account such Account Partys business and activities) to have a Material Adverse Effect if adversely determined.
2.
 
Neither the execution and delivery of the Agreement or any other documents or instruments executed or delivered in connection with the Agreement, the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the articles of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents of any Account Party or of any applicable law or of any material agreement or instrument of which I have knowledge after due inquiry to which any Account Party is a party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or constitute a default thereunder or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien of any nature whatsoever upon any of the property of any Account Party pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument, in each case, which conflict, default or Lien could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect if adversely determined.
3.
 
To my knowledge, no Account Party is in violation of any charter document, corporate minute or resolution or any instrument or agreement of which I have knowledge after due inquiry, in each case binding on it or affecting its property in any manner which could have a Material Adverse Effect.
4.
 
To my knowledge after due inquiry, each Account Party is qualified to do business in those jurisdictions in which its ownership of property or the nature of its business activities is such that failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
 
 
In rendering this opinion, I express no opinions as to the laws of any jurisdictions other than the laws of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the United States of America.
Neither this opinion nor any part hereof may be delivered to or used or relied upon by any person other than you and the Lenders without my prior written consent.

This opinion is furnished to you at the request of the Loan Parties pursuant to section 5.01(b)(iii) of the Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to those terms in the Agreement.
In this connection, we have examined the Agreement to be executed as of the date hereof.
We have examined and relied upon the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Agreement, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Loan Parties and such other documents and records as we deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.
In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that the signatures on documents and instruments examined by us as originals are authentic and that all documents submitted to us as copies conform with the originals, which facts we have not independently verified.
 
 
 
For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed that you have all requisite power and authority and have taken all necessary corporate or other action to execute and deliver (and have duly authorized, executed and delivered) the Agreement.
No opinion is expressed herein with respect to (i) the enforceability of the set-off provisions of the Agreement, (ii) the enforceability of any waiver by any Loan Party of demand, (iii) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction other than New York that limit rates of interest that may be charged or collected by the Lenders and (iv) the enforceability of any provision in the Agreement purporting to establish evidentiary standards.
We express no opinion as to (i) whether a court would give effect to the choice of law provided for in the Agreement, (ii) Section 10.09 of the Agreement, insofar as such Section relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of any court to adjudicate any controversy related to the Agreement and (iii) the waiver of trial by jury set forth in Section 10.10 of the Agreement.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:

5. The execution and delivery by each Loan Party of, and the performance and incurrence by each Loan Party of its obligations and liabilities under, the Agreement does not and will not violate any applicable law presently existing or any published rule or regulation of the United States of America (including, without limitation, Regulations U or X of the Board) or the State of New York.
The enforceability of the Agreement is subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or equity), including the principles of commercial reasonableness or conscienability.
In rendering this opinion we express no opinions as to the laws of any jurisdictions other than the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America.

USA
Dear Sirs
XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd (the Companies)
We have acted as special legal counsel in Bermuda to the Companies in connection with a five-year credit agreement.
For the purposes of giving this opinion, we have examined an executed copy of a Credit Agreement dated as of May 9, 2006, by and between XL Capital Ltd, X.L. America, Inc., XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd, XL Re Ltd, Lenders parties thereto and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the Credit Agreement which term does not include any other instrument or agreement whether or not specifically referred to therein or attached as an exhibit or schedule thereto).
We have also reviewed the memorandum of association and the bye-laws of each Company, each certified by the Secretary of the respective Company on May 9, 2006, certified copies of resolutions adopted by unanimous written resolution on April 18, 2006 by XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and April 6, 2006 by XL Re Ltd (the Minutes), and such other documents and made such enquiries as to questions of law as we have deemed necessary in order to render the opinion set forth below.
We have assumed (a) the genuineness and authenticity of all signatures and the conformity to the originals of all copies (whether or not certified) examined by us and the authenticity and completeness of the originals from which such copies were taken, (b) that where a document has been examined by us in draft form, it will be or has been executed in the form of that draft, and where a number of drafts of a document have been examined by us all changes thereto have been marked or otherwise drawn to our attention, (c) the capacity, power and authority of each of the parties to the Credit Agreement, other than the Companies, to enter into and perform its respective obligations under the Credit Agreement, (d) the due execution of the Credit Agreement by each of the parties thereto, other than the Companies, and the delivery thereof by
 
 
 
each of the parties thereto, (e) the accuracy and completeness of all factual representations made in the Credit Agreement and other documents reviewed by us, (f) that the resolutions contained in the Minutes remain in full force and effect and have not been rescinded or amended, (g) that there is no provision of the law of any jurisdiction, other than Bermuda, which would have any implication in relation to the opinions expressed herein, (h) the validity and binding effect under the laws of the State of New York (the Foreign Laws) of the Credit Agreement which is expressed to be governed by such laws in accordance with their respective terms, (i) the validity and binding effect under the Foreign Laws of the submission by each Company pursuant to the Credit Agreement to the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York (the Foreign Courts), (j) that none of the parties to the Credit Agreement has carried on or will carry on activities, other than the performance of its obligations under the Credit Agreement, which would constitute the carrying on of investment business in or from within Bermuda and that none of the parties to the Credit Agreement, other than the Companies, will perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement in or from within Bermuda.
We have also assumed that at all material times each Company will comply with the conditions attached to its registration as an insurer the Insurance Act 1978 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
The obligations of the Companies under the Credit Agreement (a) will be subject to the laws from time to time in effect relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, possessory liens, rights of set off, reorganisation, amalgamation, moratorium or any other laws or legal procedures, whether of a similar nature or otherwise, generally affecting the rights of creditors, (b) will be subject to statutory limitation of the time within which proceedings may be brought, (c) will be subject to general principles of equity and, as such, specific performance and injunctive relief, being equitable remedies, may not be available, (d) may not be given effect to by a Bermuda court, whether or not it was applying the Foreign Laws, if and to the extent they constitute the payment of an amount which is in the nature of a penalty and not in the nature of liquidated damages. Notwithstanding any contractual submission to the jurisdiction of specific courts, a Bermuda court has inherent discretion to stay or allow proceedings in the Bermuda courts.
We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision of the Credit Agreement which provides for the payment of a specified rate of interest on the amount of a judgment after the date of judgment or which purports to fetter the statutory powers of the Companies.
We have made no investigation of and express no opinion in relation to the laws of any jurisdiction other than Bermuda. This opinion is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Bermuda and is limited to and is given on the basis of the current law and practice in Bermuda. This opinion is issued solely for your benefit and the benefit of the Lenders and is not to be relied upon by any other person, firm or entity or in respect of any other matter.
 
 
 
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

On the basis of the foregoing and subject to the qualifications below, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The opinions expressed above concerning, in particular, enforceability of the Document are, to the extent that Cayman Islands law might apply, subject to the following qualifications:
 
 
 
Ad valorem stamp duty is payable within 45 days of execution or, if executed outside of the Cayman Islands, within 45 days of an executed, completed and delivered original of such document being brought into the Cayman Islands, for example, for enforcement. Otherwise stamp duty is payable on execution in order to avoid penalties if such document is to be admitted in evidence in a Cayman Islands court.
 
 
 
We are practising in the Cayman Islands and do not purport to be experts on the laws of any other jurisdiction and we therefore express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than Cayman Islands law. This opinion is also based upon the laws of the Cayman Islands in effect at the date hereof and is given only as to the circumstances existing on the date hereof and known to us.
Except as specifically stated herein, we make no comment with regard to any representations or warranties which may be made by the Company in any of the documents referred to above or otherwise.
This opinion is addressed to you and is solely for your benefit and the benefit of the Lenders. It may not be relied upon by any other person (other than any person which may become a Lender party to the Document after the date hereof) without our prior written consent.

To the Lenders party to the Credit Agreement referred to below and JPMorgan Chase

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special New York counsel to JPMorgan Chase Bank (
JPMCB
) in connection with the Credit Agreement (the 
Credit Agreement
) dated as of May 9, 2006, between XL Capital Ltd, X.L. America, Inc., XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd, the lenders party thereto and JPMCB, as Administrative Agent, providing for letters of credit to be issued, or loans to be made, by said lenders to the Account Parties in an aggregate face amount not exceeding $500,000,000. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as defined therein. This opinion letter is being delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(c) of the Credit Agreement.
 
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the Credit Agreement. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement. We have also assumed that the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and (except, to the extent set forth below, as to the Obligors) constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of, all of the parties thereto, that all signatories thereto have been duly authorized, that all such parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform the same, and that all authorizations, approvals or consents of (including all foreign exchange control approvals), all filings or registrations with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency of Bermuda or the Cayman Islands required for the making and performance by any Obligor of the Credit Agreement have been obtained or made and are in effect.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor party thereto, enforceable against such Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and subject to the possible
 
 
 
judicial application of foreign laws or governmental action, and except as the enforceability of the Credit Agreement is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
 
The foregoing opinions are subject to the following comments and qualifications:
 
(A) The enforceability of Sections 3.03 and 10.03 of the Credit Agreement may be limited by (i) laws rendering unenforceable indemnification contrary to Federal or state securities laws and the public policy underlying such laws and (ii) laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
 
(B) The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.
 
(C) Clause (iii) of the second sentence of Section 3.02 of the Credit Agreement may not be enforceable to the extent that the Guaranteed Obligations are materially modified.
 
(D) We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than the State of New York) that limit the interest, fees or other charges such Lender may impose for the loan or use of money or other credit, (ii) the last sentence of Section 2.11(d), (iii) Section 3.08 of the Credit Agreement, (iv) Section 10.08 of the Credit Agreement, (v) the first sentence of Section 10.09(b) of the Credit Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement, (vi) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 10.09(c) of the Credit Agreement with respect to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, (vii) Section 10.09(e) of the Credit Agreement to the extent it relates to immunity acquired after the date of execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and (viii) Section 10.13 of the Credit Agreement.
 
The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.
 
At the request of our client, this opinion letter is, pursuant to Section 5.01(c) of the Credit Agreement, provided to you by us in our capacity as special New York counsel to JPMCB and may not be relied upon by any Person for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement (other than your successors and assigns

In consideration of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender agrees that if you shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of any Syndicated Letter of Credit, regardless of the identity of the account party of such Syndicated Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall reimburse you by paying to you an amount equal to the amount of the LC Disbursement made by you, such payment to be made not later than noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Issuing Lender receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Issuing Lender receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time.

If any LC Disbursement is made by you, then, unless the Issuing Lender shall reimburse the amount of such LC Disbursement to you in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made by you, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date of reimbursement, at the rate per annum equal to (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate to but excluding the date three Business Days after such LC Disbursement and (ii) from and including the date three Business Days after such LC Disbursement, 2% plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. This letter agreement is an agreement of the type referred to in the definition of Confirming Lender in Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement.
 
 
 
Please indicate your acceptance of the foregoing terms and conditions by signing the two enclosed copies of this letter agreement and returning (a) one such signed copy to the undersigned at the address of the Issuing Lender indicated herein and (b) the other such signed copy to the Administrative Agent at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 1111 Fannin, 10
