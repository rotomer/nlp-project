Item 8.01. Other Events.
On June 7, 2006, subsidiaries of XL Capital Ltd (the Company), entered into an agreement (the Agreement) with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company (WSIC). The purpose of this Agreement is to release all actual or potential disputes, claims or issues arising out of or related in any way to: (i) the Liquidity Facility and the Sellers Retrocession Agreements, as well as (ii) subject to certain exceptions, the Sale and Purchase Agreement (the SPA), as amended, between XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd (XLI) and WSIC. The Company does not expect to record a charge in connection with this Agreement in the second quarter of 2006.
The Agreement further provides for a four-year term, collateralized escrow arrangement (the Fund) of up to $185 million (plus interest) to protect XLI and other subsidiaries from future nonperforming third party reinsurance
related to the Winterthur International business. The Fund has been structured to align the parties interests by providing for
any sums remaining in the Fund at the end of its term to be shared in agreed percentages.
The Agreement replaces the protections provided to XLI from WSIC for reinsurance receivables and recoverables under the Liquidity Facility and Sellers Retrocession Agreements described in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
