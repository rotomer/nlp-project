per ordinary share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2005. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses

Defined as net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, herein referred to as net income excluding net realized gains and losses. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses is a non-GAAP measure. See the schedule entitled Reconciliation at the end of this release for a reconciliation of net income/loss excluding net realized gains and losses to net income available to ordinary shareholders.
 
 
 Included in both net income and net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 was a prior year reserve strengthening for the Companys North American Reinsurance operations of $186.3 million, after tax. The prior year quarter also included a charge of $63.3 million, after tax, related to an increase in future policy benefit reserves and a write off of deferred acquisition costs with respect to certain novated blocks of U.S.-based term-life mortality business.
   
 Commenting on the current quarter results, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. OHara said: I am pleased to report the momentum generated with our first quarters record results continued in the second quarter. Our risk management initiatives are well under way, our underwriting results are solid, and our investment performance is strong. The IPO of SCA, our financial guaranty business, is on track. We remain committed to generating attractive returns and XL is well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by current market conditions.
   
 For the first half of 2006, net income available to ordinary shareholders was $835.6 million, or $4.64 per ordinary share, compared with $578.8 million, or $4.14 per ordinary share, in the first half of 2005. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the same period was $781.4 million, or $4.34 per ordinary share, as compared with $447.8 million, or $3.20 per ordinary share, in the first half of 2005.
   
 
SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS - SECOND QUARTER 2006 VERSUS SECOND QUARTER 2005
 
Insurance General Operations
 
Underwriting profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 was $37.0 million compared with $149.9 million in the prior year period. This decrease was due mainly to a foreign exchange loss of $46.3 million in the current quarter as opposed to a gain of $34.1 million in the prior year quarter.
 
 
 
 
Reinsurance General Operations
 
Underwriting profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 was $113.7 million compared with an underwriting loss of $104.5 million for the prior year period. The prior year period included a net prior year reserve increase of $186.3 million, after tax, for the Companys North American reinsurance operations. In addition, there was a foreign exchange gain of $21.1 million in the current quarter as opposed to a loss of $21.9 million in the prior year quarter.
 
 
 
 
Reinsurance Life and Annuity Operations
 
Gross premiums written were $189.2 million compared with $1.9 billion in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included a $1.8 billion U.K. annuity reinsurance transaction. Net income was $18.1 million as compared with a net loss of $55.9 million in the second quarter last year. The net loss in the prior year period included a $37.4 million increase in policy benefit reserves and a $25.9 million write off of deferred acquisition costs with respect to certain novated blocks of U.S.-based term-life mortality reinsurance business.
 
Financial Products and Services Operations
 
Total contribution for the segment was $59.9 million, an increase of $25.3 million, driven by higher net income from financial guaranty operations, primarily as a result of net premiums earned due to early terminations of certain insured transactions. In addition, net income from financial affiliates was $12.3 million as compared with a net loss of $7.4 million in the prior year quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower net gains from structured derivatives.
 
Investment Operations
 
Net investment income from general operations increased 24.7% from the prior year period to $261.4 million due to a continued rise in average yields and higher investment asset base. The prior year quarter included income related to the close out of a structured credit investment of $28.6 million. Excluding this income in the prior year quarter, net investment income from general operations increased 44.3%. Net income from investment affiliates was $28.8 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared with a net loss of $10.8 million in the second quarter of 2005.
 
Net realized losses on investments were $23.6 million in the quarter, compared with net realized gains of $90.1 million in the prior year period. Net unrealized losses on investments, net of tax, were $253.6 million at June 30, 2006 compared with net unrealized gains of $103.7 million and $502.9 million at March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. This decrease of $357.3 million for the quarter and $756.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006, was primarily due to the rise in U.S., United Kingdom and Euro-Zone interest rates during these periods.
 
 
Other Items
 
Total operating expenses were $279.5 million in the quarter, up from $248.9 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations was $726.5 million, as compared with $2.4 billion in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included the U.K. annuity reinsurance transaction of $1.8 billion.

The following is a reconciliation of the Companys (i) net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders to net income (loss) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments
and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives
, net of tax (which is a non-GAAP measure, the Exclusions) and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders equity (based on net income (loss) minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005
(U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Comment on Regulation G
This press release contains the presentation of (i) net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders equity. These items are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above.
XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XLs financial information in evaluating XLs performance. This presentation includes the use of net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below).
Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XLs operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XLs financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL generally holds its financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance of XLs financial guaranty operations. Unlike these credit derivatives, XLs weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business.
In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing net income (loss) exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XLs financial information to analyze XLs performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XLs financial information to evaluate XLs underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies who follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.
Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (ROE), excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax (the Exclusions), is a widely used measure of any companys profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. The Company establishes target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Companys ROE return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, the Companys compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependant on the achievement of the Companys performance goals to enhance shareholder value which include ROE.
