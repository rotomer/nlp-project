Press Release
HAMILTON, BERMUDA (October 17, 2006) - XL Capital Ltd (NYSE: XL) ("XL" or the "Company") today announced changes to the Companys financial reporting presentation by expanding its segment reporting to five segments. The new segment presentation will consist of the Insurance, Reinsurance, Life Operations, Financial Lines and Security Capital Assurance (SCA) operating segments. The changes to the reporting segments reflect changes in executive management responsibilities following the initial public offering of Security Capital Assurance Ltd in August, 2006. The changes include the re-presentation of the Companys former Financial Products and Services segment into the Financial Lines and SCA segments. These financial reporting changes will take effect beginning with the Company's third quarter 2006 financial results, which will be released on October 24, 2006. In order to facilitate comparability to historical results, the Company has published the Financial Lines and SCA quarterly results for the past six quarters beginning with the first quarter of 2005. The document, which also includes an example of the Segment Information presentation that will be included in future quarterly Financial Supplements using the June 30, 2006 data, is available at the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.xlcapital.com.
