for the third quarter of 2006 was $468.2 million, or $2.61 per ordinary share, compared with a net loss of $1,115.0 million, or a net loss of $8.01 per ordinary share, for the prior year period. Included in both net income and net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was a net loss after tax of $1,474.4 million related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and other natural catastrophes.

Defined as net income/loss excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, herein referred to as net income/loss excluding net realized gains and losses. Net income/loss excluding net realized gains and losses is a non-GAAP measure. See the schedule entitled Reconciliation at the end of this release for a reconciliation of net income/loss excluding net realized gains and losses to net income available to ordinary shareholders.
Commenting on the current quarter results, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. OHara said: I am pleased to report that each of our five business segments, along with investment operations, contributed to another record quarter for XL Capital. Our book value rose by over 12% this quarter, and our return on equity of 22% was exceptional, demonstrating the success of XLs risk management, underwriting and investment disciplines. I believe our initial public offering of SCA should put them on a very solid foundation for future growth and profitability. As we enter the fourth quarter of XLs twentieth year, we remain committed to disciplined execution and maintaining the momentum we have built for the benefit of our shareholders.
For the first nine months of 2006, net income available to ordinary shareholders was $1,251.4 million, or $6.98 per ordinary share, compared with a net loss of $470.4 million, or a loss of $3.39 per ordinary share, in the first nine months of 2005. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the same period was $1,249.5 million, or $6.97 per ordinary share, as compared with a net loss of $667.2 million, or a loss of $4.81 per ordinary share, in the first nine months of 2005.
 
SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS - THIRD QUARTER 2006 VERSUS THIRD QUARTER 2005
Insurance General Operations
 
Underwriting profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 was $85.6 million compared with a loss of $625.7 million in the prior year period which included the net impact of third quarter catastrophes of $751.0 million. See attached table for further details. In addition, the current quarter included a foreign exchange loss of $23.7 million as opposed to a gain of $8.1 million in the prior year quarter.

Reinsurance General Operations
 
Underwriting profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 was $119.6 million compared with an underwriting loss of $738.2 million for the prior year period which included the net impact of third quarter catastrophes of $802.3 million. See attached table for further details. In addition, the current quarter included a foreign exchange gain of $2.4 million as opposed to a loss of $12.4 million in the prior year quarter.
 
Third quarter 2006 as compared to third quarter 2005 excluding the impact of the catastrophes in the third quarter 2005
:
 
 
 
 
 
Life Operations
 
Gross premiums written were $107.4 million, an increase of 10.9% from the prior year quarter reflecting growth in the underlying business. Net income was $15.2 million as compared with $11.2 million in the prior year quarter due mainly to higher net premiums earned.
 
Financial Operations
 
 
Total contribution for the segment was $27.8 million compared with $24.0 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included net losses from Hurricane Katrina of $21.4 million. Gross and net premiums written in the current quarter were negatively impacted by the transfer of certain business to Security Capital Assurance Ltd (SCA). The net spread income on structured products decreased compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to a lower interest expense in the prior year quarter related to a change in the timing of estimated cash flows.
 
 
Net income for the segment was $20.6 million compared with $27.1 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter included a minority interest charge of 37% of two months net income of SCA from the date of SCAs initial public offering. Net premiums earned increased 13.6% primarily due to growth in their in force book of business. Higher net investment income was partially offset by an increase in operating and tax expenses.
 
Investment Operations
 
Net investment income from general operations increased 53.7% from the prior year quarter to $282.9 million due primarily to a continued rise in average yields and a higher investment asset base. Net income from investment affiliates was $39.4 million in the third quarter of 2006 compared with $56.7 million in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Net realized losses on investments were $52.7 million in the quarter, compared with net realized gains of $53.2 million in the prior year quarter. Net unrealized gains on investments, net of tax, were $394.5 million at September 30, 2006 compared with net unrealized losses of $253.6 million at June 30, 2006. This increase of $648.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, was primarily due to the decline in U.S., United Kingdom and Euro-Zone interest rates.
 
Other Items
 
Total operating expenses were $276.4 million in the quarter, up from $262.3 million in the prior year quarter. Cash flow from operations was $800.2 million, as compared with $551.7 million in the prior year quarter.

Comment on Regulation G
This press release contains the presentation of (i) net income (loss) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders equity (based on net income (loss) minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders equity. These items are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above.
XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XLs financial information in evaluating XLs performance. This presentation includes the use of net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below).
Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XLs operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XLs financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions.
In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL generally holds its financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance of XLs financial guaranty operations. Unlike these credit derivatives, XLs weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business.
In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing net income (loss) exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XLs financial information to analyze XLs performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XLs financial information to evaluate XLs underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies who follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.
Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (ROE) (minus the Exclusions) is a widely used measure of any companys profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. XL establishes target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If XLs ROE return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, XL seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, XLs compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependant on the achievement of the Companys performance goals to enhance shareholder value which include ROE.
