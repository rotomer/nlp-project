Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Stoneheath Re, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the 
Issuer
), and XL Capital Ltd, a Cayman Islands exempted limited company (the 
Company
), confirm their respective agreements with Goldman Sachs International (the 
Manager
) with respect to the issue and sale by the Issuer of U.S.$350,000,000 aggregate liquidation preference of non-cumulative perpetual preferred securities, having a liquidation preference of U.S.$1,000 per share (the 
Issuer Preferred Securities
). Any references in this Agreement to you relate to Goldman Sachs International as Manager. All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Pricing Memorandum (as defined in Section 1(a)).
 
The Issuer is licensed as a Restricted Class B insurer under the laws of the Cayman Islands (including the Insurance Law (2004 Revision)) and was formed for the purpose of providing certain insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries (the 
Ceding Insurers
) of the Company with multi-year excess of loss reinsurance capacity. At the Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 5(a)), the Issuer and the Ceding Insurers will enter into a reinsurance agreement (the 
Reinsurance Agreement
) providing for such reinsurance by the Issuer, and the Issuer and the Company will enter into a securities issuance agreement (the 
Securities Issuance Agreement
) providing that whenever the Issuer makes a payment to a Ceding Insurer under the Reinsurance Agreement, the Company will issue and deliver to the Issuer Series D Preference Ordinary Shares of the Company (the 
XL Preferred Securities
) having an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the amount of such payment on such terms as are set out in the Securities Issuance Agreement. At the Time of Delivery, the Issuer will pay the Company in advance the aggregate par value of the maximum number of XL Preferred Securities that may be issued under the Securities Issuance Agreement and such payment will be funded with the proceeds of an interest free loan (the 
Par Value Loan
) from the Company.
 
-1-
 
Pursuant to the Reinsurance Agreement, the gross proceeds from the issue and sale of the Issuer Preferred Securities will be deposited in a trust account (the 
Trust Account
) established in accordance with a trust agreement (the 
Trust Agreement
) with The Bank of New York, as trustee (the 
Account Trustee
) and will be available to satisfy obligations of the Issuer to the Ceding Insurers under the Reinsurance Agreement. In addition, the Company may be required or permitted in certain circumstances to issue and deliver to the Issuer an amount of XL Preferred Securities having an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the remaining assets in the Trust Account in exchange for a distribution of such assets from the Trust Account to the Company.
 
The Issuer will also enter into an asset swap agreement (the 
Asset Swap Agreement
) with Goldman Sachs International, as asset swap counterparty (the 
Asset Swap Counterparty
). The primary purpose of the Asset Swap Agreement is to (i) convert the interest yield on the eligible assets held in the Trust Account to a rate that is consistent with the accrual of dividends on the Issuer Preferred Securities and (ii) enable the Issuer to receive the amount initially invested in eligible assets in the Trust Account as and when such eligible assets are liquidated, regardless of the amounts actually realized upon the related sale, in each case subject to the limitations described in the Pricing Memorandum.
 
The Issuer will also enter into a interest rate swap agreement (the 
Interest Rate Swap Agreement
) with IXIS Financial Products Inc. (the 
Interest Rate Swap Counterparty
) in order to swap floating rate payments received from the Asset Swap Counterparty under the Asset Swap Agreement for fixed rate payments.
 
Furthermore, the Issuer will also enter into an administration agreement (the 
Administration Agreement
) with HSBC Financial Services (Cayman) Limited, as administrator (the 
Administrator
) and a paying agency agreement (the 
Paying Agency Agreement
) with The Bank of New York (the 
Agent
).
 
Each of the transactions set forth in the foregoing paragraphs and as more fully described in the Pricing Memorandum and the Offering Memorandum (each as defined in Section 1(a)), is collectively referred to herein as the 
Transactions
.

If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Issuer on the one hand and the Manager on the other from the offering of the Issuer Preferred Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Issuer on the one hand and the Manager on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Issuer on the one hand and the Manager on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Issuer Preferred Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Issuer bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Manager, in each case as set forth in the Offering Memorandum. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Issuer on the one hand or the Manager on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Issuer and the Manager agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Manager shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Issuer Preferred Securities underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which the Manager has otherwise been
 
-22-
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
(e)
  
The obligations of the Company and the Issuer under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Issuer may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Manager within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Manager under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the Manager may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company
 
and the Issuer
 
and to each person, if any, who controls the Company and the Issuer within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
11.
  
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Issuer and the Manager, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Manager or any controlling person of the Manager, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, the Issuer, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Issuer, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Issuer Preferred Securities.
 
12.
  
If, for any reason other than a default of the Manager, the Issuer Preferred Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer as provided herein, the Company and the Issuer will, jointly and severally, reimburse the Manager for all out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Manager in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Issuer Preferred Securities not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Manager except as provided in Sections 8, 10 and 22 hereof.
 
13.
  
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to:
 
(a)
  
the Manager shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address set forth below (or such other address as the Manager may give notice to the parties hereto):
 
 
 
(b)     the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address set forth below (or such other address as the Company may give notice to the parties hereto):
 
-23-
 
(c)     the Issuer shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address set forth below (or such other address as the Issuer may give notice to the parties hereto):
 
Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
14.     This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Manager, the Company, the Issuer and, to the extent provided in Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company, the Issuer or the Manager and each person who controls the Company, the Issuer or the Manager, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Issuer Preferred Securities from the Manager shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
15.
  
Each of the Company and the Issuer irrevocably (i) agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding against the Company or the Issuer brought by the Manager or by any person who controls the Manager arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and (iii) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. Each of the Company and the Issuer has appointed CT Corporation System, New York, New York, as its authorized agent (the 
Authorized Agent
) upon whom process may be served in any such action arising out of or based on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby which may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court by the Manager or by any person who controls the Manager, expressly consents to the jurisdiction of any such court in respect of any such action, and waives any other requirements of or objections to personal jurisdiction with respect thereto. Such appointment shall be irrevocable. Each of the Company and the Issuer represents and warrants that the Authorized Agent has agreed to act as such agent for service of process and agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents and instruments, that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect as aforesaid. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent and written notice of such service to the Company or the Issuer
 
-24-
shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon the Company or the Issuer.
 
16.
  
Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement. As used herein, the term business day shall mean any London Business Day. London Business Day shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in London are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
 
17.
  
Each of the Company and the Issuer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Issuer Preferred Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Issuer, on the one hand, and the Manager, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction the Manager is acting solely as a principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Issuer, (iii) the Manager has not assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Issuer with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Manager has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Issuer on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company or the Issuer except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) each of the Company and the Issuer has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.  Each of the Company and the Issuer agrees that it will not claim that the Manager has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or the Issuer, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
18.
  
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) among the Company, the Issuer and the Manager, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
19.
  
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
20.
  
Each of the Company, the Issuer and the Manager hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
21.
  
This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
22.
  
In respect of any judgment or order given or made for any amount due hereunder that is expressed and paid in a currency (the 
judgment currency
) other than United States dollars, the Company and the Issuer will, jointly and severally, indemnify the Manager against any loss incurred by such Manager as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the United States dollar amount is converted into the judgment currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and (ii) the rate of exchange at which the Manager is able to purchase United States dollars with the amount of judgment currency actually received by the Manager. The foregoing
 
-25-
indemnity shall constitute a separate and independent obligation of the Company and the Issuer and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid. The term 
rate of exchange
 shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into United States dollars.
 
23.
  
All obligations of and any claims against the Issuer under this Agreement shall be with recourse solely to the Issuers assets (other than its ordinary share capital of U.S.$5,000, the amount equal to U.S.$1,500 paid to the Issuer as a transaction fee, any interest income earned on such excluded amounts and the Cayman Islands bank account in which such amounts are held). The provisions of this Section 23 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
 
24.
  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all obligations of and any claims against the Issuer under this Agreement shall be extinguished and shall not thereafter revive in the event that, at any time, the Issuers assets (other than its ordinary share capital of U.S.$5,000, the amount equal to U.S.$1,500 paid to the Issuer as a transaction fee, any interest income earned on such excluded amounts and the Cayman bank account in which such amounts are held) are exhausted. The Manager shall have no further claim thereafter against the Issuer, its directors, officers or shareholders for any shortfall. The Manager shall only have recourse to the Issuers assets (other than its ordinary share capital of U.S.$5,000, the amount equal to U.S.$1,500 paid to the Issuer as a transaction fee, any interest income earned on such excluded amounts and the Cayman Islands bank account in which such amounts are held) for satisfaction of the Issuers obligations hereunder. The provisions of this Section 24 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
 
25.
  
The Manager, by entering into this Agreement, hereby covenants and agrees that it will not at any time institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer, of any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any federal, state or foreign bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations hereunder. The provisions of this Section 25 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
