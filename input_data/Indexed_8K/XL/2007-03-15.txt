Preference Share Offering
          On March 12, 2007, XL Capital Ltd (the "Company") and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigoup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Agreement") pursuant to which the Underwriters agreed to purchase, subject to and upon terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, an aggregate of 1,000,000 of the Company's Fixed/Floating Series E Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Ordinary Shares, liquidation preference US$1,000 per share (the "Series E Preference Shares"). A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is filed as an exhibit hereto.
          Until April 15, 2017, dividends on the Series E Preference Shares will be payable semiannually on a non-cumulative basis, when, as and if declared by the Company's board of directors, on April 15 and October 15 of each year at a fixed rate equal to 6.500% per annum on the liquidation preference. From and after April 15, 2017, dividends on the Series E Preference Shares will be payable quarterly on a non-cumulative basis, when, as and if declared by the Company's board of directors, on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 2.4575% on the liquidation preference. Dividends on the Series E Preference Shares, if declared, will be payable commencing on October 15, 2007. The Series E Preference Shares will be perpetual securities with no fixed maturity date and will not be convertible into any of the Company's other securities. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $983 million from the offering.
          The Series E Preference Shares were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to its registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-130036) filed by the Company with the Securities Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), and the related prospectus supplement, dated March 12, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), with respect to the Series E Preference Shares. The terms of the Series E Preference Shares are set forth in the Prospectus Supplement as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on March 13, 2006.
          On March 12, 2007, in connection with the transaction described above, the Company approved the terms of the Series E Preferred Shares by resolution of a Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. An extract of these resolutions is filed as an exhibit hereto.
Replacement Capital Covenant
On March 15, 2007, in connection with the sale of the Series E Preference Shares, the Company entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant (the "Replacement Capital Covenant"), whereby the Company agreed for the initial benefit of the holders of the Company's 6.375% senior notes due 2024 (the "Senior Notes") that all or any part of the Series E Preference Shares will not be redeemed or purchased by the Company on or before April 15, 2047, unless during the six months on or prior to the date of that redemption or purchase, the Company receives a specified amount of proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares and certain other securities that have characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series E Preference Shares being redeemed or purchased at that time. A copy of the Replacement Capital Covenant is filed as an exhibit hereto.
          
          In order to give effect to the intent of the Company set forth in Recital C of the Replacement Capital Covenant, the Company is entering into and disclosing the content of the Replacement Capital Covenant with the intent that the covenants provided for in the Replacement Capital Covenant be enforceable by each Covered Debtholder (as defined in the Replacement Capital Covenant), and that the Company be estopped from disregarding its covenants in the Replacement Capital Covenant. Initially, the holders of the Senior Notes will be the Covered Debtholders, although such designation may change without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes. The Replacement Capital Covenant may be terminated if (i) holders of at least a majority by principal amount of the then-effective series of covered debt consent or agree in writing to terminate the Replacement Capital Covenant, (ii) the Company no longer has outstanding any indebtedness that qualifies as covered debt or (iii) the Company no longer has any outstanding Series E Preference Shares. In addition, if not earlier terminated, the Replacement Capital Covenant will terminate on April 15, 2047; provided, however, that the April 15, 2047 termination date may be extended at the Company's option. A copy of the Replacement Capital Covenant is filed as an exhibit hereto.
          The foregoing descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement and the Replacement Capital Covenant do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Underwriting Agreement and the Replacement Capital Covenant, both of which are filed as exhibits hereto and are incorporated by reference herein.
          The disclosure contained and the exhibits identified in Item 1.01, "Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement," of this current report on Form 8-K are hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 3.03.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal expenses of one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) engaged reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. expressly for use therein.
          (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel (in addition to any applicable local counsel).
          (c) [Reserved]
          (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation (except as set forth below). Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action, or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (1) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (2) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (d) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
          (f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
          10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at the Time of Delivery, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties satisfactory to the Company to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within
which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at the Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
          12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7, 9 and 24 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you,
including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7, 9 and 24 hereof.
          13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you.
          All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, Attention: High Grade Syndicate, Fax No.: 212-834-6081; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(e) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
          14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
          15. The Company irrevocably (i) agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding against the Company brought by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and (iii) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. The Company has appointed CT Corporation System, New York, New York, as its authorized agent (the "Authorized Agent") upon whom process may be served in any such action arising out of or based on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby which may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter, expressly consents to the jurisdiction of any such court in respect of any such action, and waives any other requirements of or objections to personal jurisdiction with respect thereto. Such appointment shall be irrevocable. The Company represents and warrants that the Authorized Agent has agreed to act as such agent for service of process and agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents and instruments, that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect as aforesaid. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent and written notice of such service to the Company shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon the Company.
          16. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
          17. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
          18. For the avoidance of doubt and anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all references in this Agreement to the Pricing Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time shall be deemed to include the final term sheet relating to the Securities in the form attached as Schedule III hereto and to be filed with the Commission on March 13, 2007.
          19. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
          20.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
          21. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
          22. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
          23. [Reserved]
          24. In respect of any judgment or order given or made for any amount due hereunder that is expressed and paid in a currency (the "judgment currency") other than United States dollars, the Company will indemnify each Underwriter against any loss incurred by such Underwriter as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the United States dollar amount is converted into the judgment currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and (ii) the rate of exchange at which
an Underwriter is able to purchase United States dollars with the amount of judgment currency actually received by such Underwriter. The foregoing indemnity shall constitute a separate and independent obligation of the Company and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order aforesaid. The term "rate of exchange" shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into United States dollars.
          If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us one for the Company and each of you plus one for each counsel counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

ANNEX I-1
          1. To such counsel's knowledge, the issuance and sale of the Securities, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the compliance by the Company with all the provisions of the Securities and this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions by the Company contemplated therein to be performed by the Company will not (i) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any of the agreements listed on a schedule to such counsel's opinion, (ii) require any consent, approval, authorization or other order of any United States federal or State of New York court or governmental body or agency or (iii) violate or conflict with, or result in any contravention of, any applicable law, rule or administrative regulation of the United States or the State of New York, or any order or administrative or court decree of any United States or State of New York governmental body or agency or court of which such counsel has knowledge.
          2. Insofar as the laws of the State of New York are applicable thereto, the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
          3. To such counsel's knowledge, other than as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is the subject, which is required to be disclosed in such Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus and is not so disclosed.
          4. The Company is not and will not become, as a result of the offering and sale of the Securities and the other transactions contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act.
          5. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and the Prospectus Supplement was filed on March [__], 2007 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act and, to such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus has been issued or proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
          6. Except as to (i) financial statements, financial schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein and (ii) the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as to which we have not been requested to and do not express any opinion, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
          7. Each of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, Annual Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed on March 23, 2006 and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on February 1, 2007, February 22, 2007, February 26, 2007, March 12, 2007 and [add others], in each case incorporated by
reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus (except for the financial statements, financial schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein as to which such counsel need not express an opinion), as of the date it was filed with the Commission, appears on its face to have been appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act.
          8. The statements set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Series E Preference Shares," insofar as they purport, in the context of the purpose stated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus for such section, to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities are accurate in all material respects and fairly summarize the terms of the Securities in all material respects.
          9. The statements set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Certain Tax ConsiderationsTaxation of XL Capital and XLUnited States," "Certain Tax ConsiderationsTaxation of ShareholdersUnited States," and "Certain Tax ConsiderationsBackup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting," insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the federal income tax laws of the United States of America referred to therein or legal conclusions with respect thereto, are accurate and complete in all material respects.
ANNEX I-2
          We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of Cayman Islands and Bermuda counsel to the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company, representatives of counsel for the Underwriters and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Pricing Prospectus, as supplemented by the final term sheet attached to this Agreement and filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 (the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and related matters were discussed. Although we have made certain inquiries and investigations in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Pricing Disclosure Package, the limitations inherent in the role of outside counsel to the Company are such that we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in such documents, except as provided in paragraphs 8 and 9 of our opinion to you of even date herewith. Subject to the foregoing, we advise you that no facts have come to our attention that lead us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, as of each date it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the Pricing Disclosure Package, taken together, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that we have not been requested to and do not express any comment with respect to the financial statements or other financial data that is included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package).
ANNEX II
          1. The Company is an exempted company duly incorporated with limited liability and existing under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The Company possesses the capacity to sue and be sued in its own name and is in good standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands.
          2. The Company's authorised share capital is US$9,999,900 divided into 999,990,000 Ordinary Shares of a nominal or par value of US$0.01 each.
          3. The authorised share capital of the Company is described in its Memorandum of Association as consisting of "Ordinary Shares." The Memorandum of Association provides that the Company has power, insofar as is permitted by law, to issue any part of its capital, whether original, redeemed or increased, with or without any preference, priority or special privilege or subject to any postponement of rights or to any conditions or restrictions. The Articles of Association provide that, without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of existing shares, any share may be issued with such preferred, deferred or other special rights, terms or conditions, or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividends, voting, return of share capital, exchange for other classes of shares, exchangeability for other securities or otherwise, as the Directors may from time to time determine. Therefore, the issue by the Company of the Securities described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus is within the power of the Company's Board of Directors.
          4. The Company has, at the date of this opinion, sufficient authorised share capital to issue the Securities. The Securities to be issued in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorised and, when issued, paid for with the consideration set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, and registered in the Company's Register of Members in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and the Underwriting Agreement, will be legally and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
          5. The issuance of the Securities is not subject to any pre-emptive or other similar rights under Cayman Islands law or the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company or, based and in reliance solely on the Officer's Certificate, any material contract to which the Company is a party. There are no proposals of which such counsel is aware at the date hereof to change the laws of the Cayman Islands so as to render the issuance of the Securities pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement unlawful under Cayman Islands law.
          6. Upon the valid issue of the Securities, the holders of such shares will have the rights conferred upon the holders of such shares as set forth in the Committee Resolutions.
          7. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, to issue the Securities, to enter into, execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and to take all action as may be necessary to complete the transactions contemplated thereby.
          8. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Securities in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, have been duly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
          9. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
          10. No consent, licence or authorisation of, filing or registration with, or other act by or in respect of, any governmental authority, public body or court of the Cayman Islands is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the entry into, execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement or to ensure the legality, validity, admissibility into evidence or enforceability as to the Company, of the Underwriting Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issue of the Securities in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement.
          11. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Securities, do not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (a) any requirement of any law, statute, decree, rule or regulation of the Cayman Islands, (b) the Constitutional Documents, or (c) based and in reliance solely on the Officer's Certificate, any material contract to which the Company is a party.
          12. The transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement are not subject to any currency deposit or reserve requirements in the Cayman Islands. There is no restriction or requirement of the Cayman Islands binding on the Company which limits the availability or transfer of foreign exchange (i.e. monies denominated in currencies other than Cayman Islands dollars) for the purposes of the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement.
          13. The choice of the laws of the State of New York as the proper law to govern the Underwriting Agreement is a valid choice of law under Cayman Islands law and such choice of law would be recognised, upheld and applied by the courts of the Cayman Islands as the proper law of the Underwriting Agreement in proceedings brought before them in relation to the Underwriting Agreement provided that (a) the point is specifically pleaded; (b) such choice of law is valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York; and (c) recognition would not be contrary to public policy as that term is understood under Cayman Islands law.
          14. The submission by the Company to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement is not contrary to Cayman Islands law and would be recognised by the courts of the Cayman Islands as a legal, valid and binding submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of New York, if such submission is accepted by such courts and is legal, valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York.
          15. A final and conclusive judgment of a competent foreign court against the Company based upon the Underwriting Agreement under which a definite sum of money is payable (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other similar penalty) may be the subject of
in personam
enforcement proceedings in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands under the common law doctrine of obligation by action on the debt evidenced by the judgment of such competent foreign court. A final opinion as to the availability of this remedy should be sought when the facts surrounding the foreign court's judgment are known, but, on general principles, such counsel would expect such proceedings to be successful provided that:
          16. Neither the Company nor any of its assets or property enjoys, under Cayman Islands law, immunity on the grounds of sovereignty from any legal or other proceedings whatsoever or from enforcement, execution or attachment in respect of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement or the Securities.
          17. Based solely upon the Litigation Search and the Officer's Certificate:
          18. There are, subject as provided in paragraph (__) under "Reservations" below in such opinion, no taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, duties or similar charges under the laws of the Cayman Islands now due, or which could in the future become due to any governmental authority of or in the Cayman Islands, in connection with the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Underwriting Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Securities, or in connection with the admissibility in evidence thereof and the Company is not required by any Cayman Islands law or regulation to make any deductions or withholdings in the Cayman Islands from any payment it may make thereunder.
          19. The statements contained in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus with regard to Cayman Islands law (a) in relation to the Company and the incorporation and legal status of the Company (b) under the captions "The Offering," "Description of the Series E Preference Shares," "Description of XL Capital Share Capital" and "Description of XL Capital Preference Ordinary Shares" are true and accurate.
          20. The statements made in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus under the headings "The Offering" within "Prospectus Supplement Summary," "Description of the Series E Preference Shares," "Description of XL Capital Share Capital," "Description of XL Capital Ordinary Shares" and "Description of XL Capital Preference Ordinary
Shares," in so far as such statements purport to constitute summaries of the terms of the Securities, conform to the rights conferred upon the holders of the Securities in the Resolutions authorising the issue of such preference shares and constitute accurate summaries of such terms of the Securities in all material respects. The statements made in the third paragraph beginning "Each Class A ordinary share" and ending "Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended)." under heading "Part II  Market for Registrant's Common Equity, related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities," on page 49 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2006 and "Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares  Provisions in our Articles of Association may restrict the ownership and transfer of our ordinary shares" and "Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares  It may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against XL Capital Ltd or its directors and executive officers," in so far as they purport to constitute a summary of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, constitute an accurate summary of such documents and the terms of the Securities in all material respects. The statements made in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain Tax Considerations  Taxation of XL Capital and XL  Cayman Islands" and "Certain Tax Considerations  Taxation of Shareholders  Cayman Islands" and in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2006 under the caption "Risk Factors  Risks Related to Taxation  We may become subject to taxes in the Cayman Islands after June 2, 2018, which may have a material advisor effect on our results of operations" are accurate in all material respects.
          21. It is not necessary under the laws of the Cayman Islands that any of the Underwriters be authorized or qualified to carry on business in the Cayman Islands for their entry into, execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Underwriting Agreement. None of the Underwriters will be deemed to be residents, domiciled, carrying on business or subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands by reason only of their entry into, execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Underwriting Agreement. The foregoing opinion and the opinion in paragraph 23 below is subject to any statutory or regulatory obligation imposed under the laws of the Cayman Islands if a Cayman Islands branch or company carrying on business in or from the Cayman Islands enters into the Underwriting Agreement as one of the parties thereto.
