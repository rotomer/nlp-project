9.           The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or many amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any issuer information filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal expenses of one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) engaged reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
 
(a)           Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel (in addition to any applicable local counsel).
 
(b)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation (except as set forth below).  Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there
 
may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action, or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential partyto such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (1) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (2) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
 
(c)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (d) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(d)           The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
10.           (a)           If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at the Time of Delivery, the Representative may in the its discretion arrange for the Representative or another party or other parties satisfactory to the Company to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representative do not arrange for the purchase of such
 
Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representative to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that the Representative have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representative that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representative and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at the Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representative and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.           The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.           If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7, 9 and 24 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representative for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7, 9 and 24 hereof.
 
13.           In all dealings hereunder, the Representative shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representative.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Representative in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, Attention:  General Counsel, Fax No.:  212-902-3000; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention:  Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(e) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representative upon request.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
 
14.           This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.  No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
15.           The Company irrevocably (i) agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding against the Company brought by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding and (iii) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding.  The Company has appointed CT Corporation System, New York, New York, as its authorized agent (the ) upon whom process may be served in any such action arising out of or based on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby which may be instituted in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Court by any Underwriter or by any person who controls any Underwriter, expressly consents to the jurisdiction of any such court in respect of any such action, and waives any other requirements of or objections to personal jurisdiction with respect thereto.

ANNEX II
 
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject to the reservations set out below and to any matters not disclosed to such counsel, such counsel is of the opinion that:
 
1.           The Company is an exempted company duly incorporated with limited liability and existing under the laws of the Cayman Islands.  The Company possesses the capacity to sue and be sued in its own name and is in good standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands.
 
2.           The issuance of the Notes is not subject to any pre-emptive or other similar rights under Cayman Islands law or the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company or, based and in reliance solely on the Officers Certificate, any material contract to which the Company is a party.
 
3.           The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as contemplated in the Prospectus Supplement and the Base Prospectus, to issue the Notes, to enter into, execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Subject Agreements and to take all action as may be necessary to complete the transactions contemplated thereby.
 
4.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Subject Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Notes in accordance with the Subject Agreements, have been duly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
 
5.           The Subject Agreements have been duly executed by the Company and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
 
6.           No consent, licence or authorisation of, filing or registration with, or other act by or in respect of, any governmental authority, public body or court of the Cayman Islands is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the entry into, execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Subject Agreements or to ensure the legality, validity, admissibility into evidence or enforceability as to the Company, of the Subject Agreements or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issue of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Subject Agreements.
 
7.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Subject Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Notes, do not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (a) any requirement of any law, statute, decree, rule or regulation of the Cayman Islands, (b) the Constitutional Documents or (c) based and in reliance solely on the Officers Certificate, any material contract to which the Company is a party.
 
8.           The transactions contemplated by the Subject Agreements are not subject to any currency deposit or reserve requirements in the Cayman Islands.  There is no restriction or requirement of the Cayman Islands binding on the Company which limits the availability or transfer of foreign exchange (i.e. monies denominated in currencies other than Cayman Islands dollars) for the purposes of the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Subject Agreements.
 
9.           The choice of the laws of the State of New York as the proper law to govern the Subject Agreements is a valid choice of law under Cayman Islands law and such choice of law would be recognised, upheld and applied by the courts of the Cayman Islands as the proper law of the Subject Agreements in proceedings brought before them in relation to the Subject Agreements provided that (a) the point is specifically pleaded;
 
II-1
(b) such choice of law is valid and binding under the Laws of New York; and (c) recognition would not be contrary to public policy as that term is understood under Cayman Islands law.
 
10.           The submission by the Company to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York pursuant to the SubjectAgreements is not contrary to Cayman Islands law and would be recognised by the courts of the Cayman Islands as a legal, valid and binding submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of New York, if such submission is accepted by such courts and is legal, valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York.
 
 
11.           A final and conclusive judgment of a competent foreign court against the Company based upon the Subject Agreements under which a definite sum of money is payable (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other similar penalty) may be the subject of enforcement proceedings in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands under the common law doctrine of obligation by action on the debt evidenced by the judgment of such competent foreign court.  A final opinion as to the availability of this remedy should be sought when the facts surrounding the foreign courts judgment are known, but, on general principles, we would expect such proceedings to be successful provided that:
in personam
 
(a)           the court which gave the judgment was competent to hear the action in accordance with private international law principles as applied in the Cayman Islands; and
 
(b)           the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Cayman Islands, has not been obtained by fraud or in proceedings contrary to natural justice and is not based on an error in Cayman Islands law.
 
12.           Neither the Company nor any of its assets or property enjoys, under Cayman Islands law, immunity on the grounds of sovereignty from any legal or other proceedings whatsoever or from enforcement, execution or attachment in respect of its obligations under the Subject Agreements or the Notes.
 
13.           Based solely upon the Litigation Search and the Officers Certificate:
 
(a)           no litigation, arbitration or administrative or other proceeding of or before the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands is pending against the Company; and
 
(b)           no resolution of members has been passed to wind up or appoint a liquidator or receiver of the Company and no petition or application to wind up the Company or to reorganise its affairs pursuant to a scheme of arrangement and no application for the appointment of a receiver has been filed with the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands.
 
14.           There are, subject as provided in paragraph (r) under Reservations below in this opinion, no taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, duties or similar charges under the laws of the Cayman Islands now due, or which could in the future become due to any governmental authority of or in the Cayman Islands, in connection with the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Subject Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Notes, or in connection with the admissibility in evidence thereof and the Company is not required by any Cayman Islands law or regulation to make any deductions or withholdings in the Cayman Islands from any payment it may make thereunder.
 
15.           The statements made in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption Certain Tax Considerations  Cayman Islands and in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2006 under the caption Risk Factors  Risks Related to Taxation  We may become subject 1o taxes in the Cayman Islands after June 2, 2018, which may have a material adverse effect or our results of operations are accurate in all material respects.
 
II-2
 
16.           It is not necessary under the laws of the Cayman Islands that any of the Underwriters be authorised or qualified to carryon business in the Cayman Islands for their entry into, execution, delivery, performance, or enforcement of the Subject Agreements.  None of the Underwriters will be deemed to be resident, domiciled, carrying on business or subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands by reason only of their entry into, execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Subject Agreements.  The foregoing opinion is subject to any statutory or regulatory obligation imposed under the laws of the Cayman Islands if a Cayman Islands branch or company carrying on business in or from the Cayman Islands enters into the Subject Agreements as one of the parties thereto.
 
 
II-3
ANNEX III
 
 
1.           The Company is not in violation of any organizational document, corporate minute or resolution or any instrument or agreement of which I have knowledge after due inquiry, in each case binding on it or affecting its property in any manner which could have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
2.           There is no litigation or governmental proceeding by or against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company or concerning any property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, pending or threatened, that (A) could reasonably be expected (in light of reserves and total shareholders equity of the Company after taking into account the Companys business and activities) to have a Material Adverse Effect if adversely determined or (B) is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus and is not so disclosed, other than in the case of clause (A), as routinely encountered in claims activity or as disclosed in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or the documents incorporated therein by reference.

The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture, the Third Supplemental Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the transactions contemplated thereby and the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes by the Company will not (A) violate or conflict with the terms, conditions or provisions of the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association or other organizational documents of the Company or any applicable law, rule or administrative regulation of the United States or the State of New York, or any order or administrative decree of any United States or State of New York governmental body or agency or court of which I have knowledge or (B) constitute a violation of, or a default under, any covenant, restriction or provision with respect to financial ratios or tests to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company is subject or any aspect of the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
4.

In that event, the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts receivable by a Holder after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction on such payment of additional amounts) shall equal the respective amounts that would have been receivable by such Holder had no such withholding or deduction been required (Additional Amounts), except that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable in relation to any payment (including a payment made in connection with a redemption) in respect of any of the 2027 Securities (a) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Person who would be able to avoid such withholding or deduction by complying with such Persons statutory requirements or by making a declaration of non-residence or similar claim for exemption but, in either case, fails to do so, or is liable for such taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges in respect of such 2027 Security by reason of his having some connection with (including, without limitation, being a citizen of, being incorporated or engaged in a trade or business in, or having a residence or principal place of business or other presence in) the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, as the case may be, other than (i) the mere holding of such 2027 Security; (ii) the receipt of principal, interest or other amount in respect of such 2027 Security; or (iii) the mere enforcement of rights with respect to such 2027 Security; (b) presented for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date, except to the extent that the relevant Holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting the same for payment on or before the expiration of such period of 30 days; (c) to a fiduciary, a partnership or person who is not the beneficial owner of a 2027 Security, if and to the extent that, as a result of an applicable tax treaty, no Additional Amounts would have been payable had the beneficiary, partner or beneficial owner owned the 2027 Security directly; (d) on account of any inheritance, gift, estate, personal property, stamp, sales or transfer or similar taxes, duties, levies, assessments or similar governmental charges; or (e) on account of any taxes, duties, levies, assessments or governmental charges that are payable otherwise than by withholding from payments in respect of such 2027 Security.
 
In the event that payments in respect of the 2027 Securities are subject to withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes, the Company will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.  The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any taxes so deducted or withheld from each relevant taxing jurisdiction imposing such taxes and will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide or make available such certified copies (or other documentary evidence establishing the payment of such taxes) to each Holder.

Any reference in the Indenture to principal, premium or interest in respect of the 2027 Securities, any redemption amount and any other amounts in the nature of principal shall be deemed also to refer to any Additional Amounts that may be payable under the Indenture, and the express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provision hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made.
 
 
 
 
 
Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to the Indenture, if the 2027 Securities require the payment of Additional Amounts, at least 30 days prior to each date on which any payments under or with respect to the 2027 Securities are due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter) the Company or its designee shall furnish to the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent an Officers Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable, and any other information to enable the Trustee or such Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the payment date.
 
The Company will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of any 2027 Securities or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the 2027 Securities), or the receipt of any payments with respect to the 2027 Securities, excluding any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands or Bermuda in which a Paying Agent is located, other than those resulting from, or required to be paid in connection with, the enforcement of the 2027 Securities, the Indenture or any other such document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the 2027 Securities.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company designated as its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2027 (herein sometimes referred to as the Notes), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $325,000,000, issued under and pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of June 2, 2004 (the Base Indenture), duly executed and delivered, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the Trustee), and a Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 7, 2007 (the Fourth Supplemental Indenture), between the Company and the Trustee (such Base Indenture as amended and supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the INDENTURE), to which the Indenture and all subsequent indentures supplemental thereto relating to the Notes reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series so issued are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
The Notes will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Companys option, at a redemption price equal to the accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date plus the greater of:  (A) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, and (B) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture.
 
If a Tax Event occurs and is continuing, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date and Additional Amounts, if any, then due or that will become due on the Redemption Date as a result of the redemption, as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture.
 
No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.
 
The Notes shall constitute the senior, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and shall rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.
 
In the case of an Event of Default described in Section 5.01(5) or 5.01(6) of the Indenture, all unpaid principal of and accrued interest and Additional Amounts on the Notes then Outstanding shall be due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders of any Notes.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains, with certain exceptions as therein provided, provisions permitting Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of De-
 
 
 
 
fault, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding shall have made a written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it, (iii) the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, and (iv) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such written request during such 60-day period.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by any Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
