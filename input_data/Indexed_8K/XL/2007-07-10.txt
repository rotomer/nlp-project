In the event of termination of the Executives employment by the Registrant without Cause (as defined in the employment agreement), including termination of employment following the Registrants issuance of a notice of non-renewal of the employment agreement, or by the Executive if the Executive is assigned duties inconsistent with his position without his consent (but such assignment does not constitute "Good Reason" as defined in the employment agreement), the Executive shall be entitled to (i) the Executives then current base salary through the date on which termination occurs, (ii) provided the Executive executes a general release of claims, a cash lump sum payment equal to the sum of (x) two times the Executives then current base salary and (y) one times the higher of the targeted annual bonus for the year of such termination or the average of the Executives annual bonus for the three years (or shorter period of employment) immed iately preceding the year of termination, and (iii) any annual bonus awarded but not yet paid.

(b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that (i) the aggregate amount of the Executive's Parachute Payments equals or exceeds 3.25 times the Executive's Base Amount, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Executive's Parachute Payments is less than 3.25 times the Base Amount but one or more Payments would be subject to the Excise Tax even if the payments set forth in Section 8(d)(iii)(B) and (C) hereof were each reduced by 20 percent, or (iii) notwithstanding a reduction in payments pursuant to Section 9(a) above, an Excise Tax is payable by the Executive on one or more Payments, then, in any such case, Payments shall not be reduced and the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any income or Excise Tax) imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes, the Executive retains from the Gross-Up Payment an amount equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.
(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(d), all determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including determination of whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and of the amount of any such Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by a nationally recognized public accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within l5 business days of the date of termination of the Executive's employment, if applicable, or such earlier time as is reasonably requested. The initial Gross-Up Payment, if any, as determined pursuant to this Section 9(c), shall be paid to the Executive within five business days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion that he has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his Federal income tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm meeting the requirements of this Section 9(c) shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive, subject only to payments pursuant to the following sentence based on a determination that additional Gross-Up Payments should have been made, consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder (the amount of such additional payments are referred to herein as the "Gross-Up Underpayment"). In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 9(d) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Gross-Up Underpayment that has occurred and any such Gross-Up Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Company.
(d) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the United States Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Executive of any Excise Tax and, therefore, the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but not later than 30 business days after the Executive receives written notice of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires, in good faith, to contest such claim (which notice shall set forth the bases for such contest) and that it will bear the costs and provide the indemnification as required by this sentence, the Executive shall, in good faith:
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
(ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall, in good faith, reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive,
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
(iv) permit the Company to participate, in good faith, in any proceedings relating to such claim;
, , that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis to the Executive, for any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation and payment of all costs and expenses.
provided
however
Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(d), the Company shall, exercising good faith, control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option (but in good faith), may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option (but in good faith), either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , , that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis to the Executive, from any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to the payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(d), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(d)) promptly pay to the Company, as the case may be, the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(d), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then any obligation of the Executive to repay such advance shall be forgiven and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
provided
however
and
further
provided
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Executive's failure to strictly comply with the notice provisions set forth in this Section 9, so long as such failure does not prevent the Company from contesting an excise tax claim, shall not adversely affect the Executive's rights under this Section 9. Payments required under this Section 9 shall be paid within the time periods required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v).
10. NO MITIGATION; NO OFFSET.
In the event of any termination of employment under Section 8, above, the Executive shall be under no obligation to mitigate damages or seek other employment, and, except as expressly set forth herein with respect to Executive's requirement to accept the medical, dental and other welfare benefits offered by a prospective employer, there shall be no offset against amounts due the Executive under this Agreement on account of any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that he may obtain.
11. NONCOMPETITION AND NONSOLICITATION.
The Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that (a) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Executive does not and will not conflict with, breach, violate or cause a default under any contract, agreement, instrument, order, judgment or decree to which the Executive is a party or by which he is bound, (b) except for agreements provided to the Company by the Executive, the Executive is not a party to or bound by any employment agreement, noncompetition agreement, confidentiality agreement or similar agreement with any other person, and (c) upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, this Agreement will be the valid and binding obligation of the Executive, enforceable in accordance with its terms. The Executive agrees that the products of the Company and its Affiliates shall constitute the exclusive property of the Company and its Affiliates.
For the avoidance of doubt, all trademarks, policy language or forms, products or services (including products and services under development), trade names, trade secrets, service marks, designs, computer programs and software, utility models, copyrights, know-how and confidential information, applications for registration of any of the foregoing and the right to apply for them in any part of the world (whether any of the foregoing shall be registered or unregistered) created or discovered or participated in by the Executive during the course of his employment (whether or not pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) or under the instructions of the Company or its Affiliates are and shall be the absolute property of the Company and its Affiliates, as appropriate. Without limiting the foregoing, the Executive hereby assigns to the Company any and all of the Executive's right, title and interest, if any, pertaining to the insurance and reinsurance (including, without limitation, finite insurance and reinsurance), risk assumption, risk management, brokerage, financial and other products or services developed or improved upon by the Executive (including, without limitation, any related "know-how") while employed by the Company or its Affiliates, including any patent, trademark, trade name, copyright, ownership or other right that may pertain thereto.
Since Executive has obtained and is likely to obtain in the course of Executive's employment with the Company and its Affiliates knowledge of trade names, trade secrets, know-how, products and services (including products and services under development), techniques, methods, lists, computer programs and software and other confidential information relating to the Company and its Affiliates, and their employees, clients, business or business opportunities, Executive hereby undertakes that:
(i) Executive will not (either alone or jointly with or on behalf of others and whether directly or indirectly) encourage, entice, solicit or endeavor to encourage, entice or solicit away from employment with the Company or its Affiliates, or hire or cause to be hired, any officer or employee of the Company or its Affiliates (or any individual who was within the prior twelve (12) months an officer or employee of the Company or its Affiliates), or encourage, entice, solicit or endeavor to encourage, entice or solicit any individual to violate the terms of any employment agreement or arrangement between such individual and the Company or any of its Affiliates; , , that nothing in this subsection shall prevent Executive from providing a personal reference on behalf of any officer or employee of the Company to a third party, appearing or being involved in a general advertisement for employment not specifically tailored to entice only officers or employees of the Company;
provided
however
(ii) Executive will not (either alone or jointly with or on behalf of others and whether directly or indirectly) interfere with or disrupt or seek to interfere with or disrupt (A) the relationships between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any primary property, casualty, specialty insurance and/or reinsurance customer or client of the Company and its Affiliates, on the other hand, (including any insured or reinsured party) with regard to such area of insurance and /or reinsurance who during the period of twenty-four months immediately preceding such termination shall have been such a customer or client, or (B) the supply to the Company and its Affiliates of any services by any supplier or agent or broker with regard to the insurance and/or reinsurance areas who during the period of twenty-four months immediately preceding such termination shall have supplied services to any such person, with regard to the insurance and/or reinsurance areas nor will Executive interfere or seek to interfere with the terms on which such supply or agency or brokering services during such period as aforesaid have been made or provided; and
(iii) Executive will not (either alone or jointly with or on behalf of others and whether directly or indirectly) whether as an employee, consultant, partner, principal, agent, distributor, representative or stockholder (except solely as a less than one percent stockholder of a publicly traded company), without the written consent of the Company through the Chief Executive Officer, after receipt of specific notice by Executive of the potential competitive situation (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) engage in any activities in Bermuda or the United States if such activities are competitive with the primary or reinsurance property, casualty, specialty insurance and/or reinsurance businesses that (i) are then being conducted by the Company or its Affiliates and (ii) during the period of the Executive's employment were either being conducted by the Company or its Affiliates or actively being developed by the Company or its Affiliates.
The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall continue as long as the Executive is employed by the Company or its Affiliates and such provisions shall continue in effect after such employment is terminated for any reason until the first anniversary of such termination, provided that if such employment is terminated by the Company under Section 8(d)(iii) or by the Executive under Section 8(d)(iii), the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) shall automatically terminate upon such termination of employment, unless the Company elects, in writing, upon such termination to continue the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) in effect through the six-month anniversary of such termination of employment in which case the Company shall be obligated to pay the Executive, in addition to any of the Executive's rights under Section 8(d)(iii), a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (x) six months of his Base Salary and (y) one half of the Executive's average annual bonus payable by the Company or its subsidiaries for the three years (or shorter period of employment by any of such entities) immediately preceding the year of termination, and such lump sum payment shall, subject to Section 25 below, be made within 10 days following termination of employment.
For purposes of this Agreement, an "Affiliate" of the Company includes any person, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company, and such term shall specifically include, without limitation, the Company's majority-owned subsidiaries.
The limitations on the Executive set forth in this Section shall also apply to any agent or other representative acting on behalf of Executive at the Executive's specific intentional direction.
While the restrictions aforesaid are considered by both parties to be reasonable in all the circumstances it is recognized that restrictions of the nature in question may fail for reasons unforeseen and accordingly it is hereby declared and agreed that if any of such restrictions or the geographic or other scope thereof shall be adjudged to be void as going beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of the interests of the Company and its Affiliates but would be valid if part of the wording thereof were deleted and/or the periods (if any) thereof reduced and/or geographic or other area dealt with thereby reduced in scope then said restrictions shall apply with such modifications as may be necessary to make them valid and effective.
Nothing contained in this Section 11 shall limit in any manner any additional obligations to which Executive may be bound pursuant to any other agreement or any applicable law, rule or regulation and Section 11 shall apply, subject to its terms, after employment has terminated for any reason.
12. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
The Executive covenants that he shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, use for the Executive's own benefit or the benefit of any other person or entity other than the Company and its Affiliates or disclose to any person, other than an employee of the Company or other person to whom disclosure is in good faith believed to be desirable to the performance by the Executive of his duties in the employ of the Company, any confidential, proprietary, secret, or privileged information about the Company or its Affiliates or their business or operations, including, but not limited to, information concerning trade secrets, know-how, software, data processing systems, policy language and forms, inventions, designs, processes, formulae, notations, improvements, financial information, business plans, prospects, referral sources, lists of suppliers and customers, legal advice and other information with respect to the affairs, business, clients, customers, agents or other business relationships of the Company or its Affiliates. Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret, confidential proprietary or privileged information or data relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates or predecessor companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by Executive during his employment, unless and until such information has become known to the public generally (other than as a result of unauthorized disclosure by the Executive) or unless he is required to disclose such information by a court or by a governmental body with apparent authority to require such disclosure. The foregoing covenant by the Executive shall be without limitation as to time and geographic application and this Section 12 shall apply in accordance with its terms after employment has terminated for any reason. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he shall have no authority to waive any attorney-client or other privilege without the express prior written consent of the Compensation Committee as evidenced by the signature of the Company's General Counsel.
13. WITHHOLDING.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to be made by the Company hereunder to the Executive shall be subject to withholding of such amounts relating to taxes as the Company may reasonably determine should be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. In lieu of withholding such amounts, in whole or in part, the Company may, in its sole discretion, accept other provision for payment of taxes as required by law, provided it is satisfied that all requirements of law affecting its responsibilities to withhold such taxes have been satisfied.

(i) any person (which, for all purposes hereof, shall include, without limitation, an individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, unincorporated association, unincorporated syndicate, unincorporated organization, trust, body corporate and a trustee, executor, administrator or other legal representative) (a "Person") or any group, as defined in Sections 13(d) or 14(d) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (other than a group of which the Executive is a member or which has been organized by the Executive), becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing, or acquires the right to control or direct, or to acquire through the conversion of securities or the exercise of warrants or other rights to acquire securities, 30% or more of either (I) the outstanding Ordinary Shares of the Company, (II) the outstanding securities of the Company having a right to vote in the election of directors, or (III) the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company having a right to vote in the election of directors; or
