Defined as net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, herein referred to as net income excluding net realized gains and losses. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses is a non-GAAP measure.   See the schedule entitled Reconciliation at the end of this release for a reconciliation of net income/loss excluding net realized gains and losses to net income available to ordinary shareholders.
 
 
 
Included in net realized gains and losses on investments for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 is a gain of $81.3 million related to the previously announced sale of 16.6% of Security Capital Assurance Ltd (SCA) common shares.  After the sale, the Company owns approximately 46% of SCA common shares.
 
Commenting on the current quarter results, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. OHara said: XLs six consecutive quarters of excellent earnings demonstrate the advantages of our unique dual platform. Our continuous improvement in risk management, commitment to disciplined growth, along with our sharpened strategic focus, have all contributed to the achievement of record results, and as we have demonstrated in this quarter, provide a solid platform for delivering shareholder value.
 
For the first half of 2007, net income available to ordinary shareholders was a record $1.09 billion, or $6.06 per ordinary share, compared with $835.6 million, or $4.64 per ordinary share, in the first half of 2006. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the same period was $1.06 billion, or $5.87 per ordinary share, as compared with $781.4 million, or $4.34 per ordinary share, in the first half of 2006.
 
At June 30, 2007, fully diluted book value per ordinary share was $54.74, as compared to $54.85 as at March 31, 2007.  Offsetting net income for the quarter was a decrease in net unrealized gains/losses on investments of $615.5 million, due to the rise in interest rates.   Basic book value per ordinary share was $55.01 at June 30, 2007 as compared to $54.95 and $53.12 as at March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
 
Segment results reflect the Companys previously announced realignment of its operating segments.  As a result, information related to prior periods has been re-presented to conform to the current period presentation.  There was no effect on net income as a result of these changes.
 
 
SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS  SECOND QUARTER 2007 VERSUS SECOND QUARTER 2006
Insurance
 
Underwriting profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $102.2 million compared with $63.8 million in the prior year period.  This increase was due mainly to net favorable prior year development of $43.7 million, as compared to net adverse development of $4.8 million in the prior year.

Reinsurance
 
Underwriting profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $129.8 million compared with $81.8 million for the prior year period.  The increase is principally due to net favorable prior year development of $80.4 million, compared to net adverse development of $3.0 million in the prior year period. The current quarter net favorable prior year development of $80.4 million includes $48.5 million related to property and other short-tail lines and $31.9 million related to casualty and other lines.
 
 
 
 
Life Operations
 
Gross premiums written were $235.0 million compared with $194.7 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting continued growth in the underlying business and favorable foreign exchange movements.  Net income was $24.7 million as compared with $27.7 million in the second quarter last year.
 
Financial Operations
 
SCAs results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 are consolidated for the period through the effective date of the sale.  Comparative results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 are for the full quarter.  XLs share of SCAs results from the date of sale to June 30, 2007 are included in net income from operating affiliates.
 
Net income for the segment before equity minority interest was $23.5 million compared with $38.3 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter included an equity minority interest charge of $9.1 million.
 
Investment Operations
 
Net investment income from P&C operations, excluding investment income from Structured Products, increased 23.6% from the prior year period to $323.0 million due to a continued rise in average yields.  Net income from investment affiliates was $67.0 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared with $28.8 million in the second quarter of 2006.  Net income from investment manager affiliates increased to $43.9 million as compared to $28.3 million for the prior year period.
 
Total net realized gains on investments were $18.3 million in the quarter, or a loss of $63.0 million excluding the gain on sale of SCA shares, compared with net realized losses of $23.6 million in the prior year period.  Net unrealized losses on investments, net of tax, were $309.9 million at June 30, 2007 compared with net unrealized gains of $305.6 million and $410.5 million at March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. This decrease of $615.5 million for the quarter and $720.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007, was substantially due to the rise in U.S., U.K. and Euro-Zone interest rates during these periods.

Other Items
 
Total operating expenses were $306.6 million in the quarter, up from $279.5 million in the prior year period.  The increase was due mainly to an increase in compensation costs related to both business development initiatives and performance-based programs and the impact of foreign exchange.
 
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 7.7 million ordinary shares at an average price of $77.92 per share.  Year to date, the Company repurchased 10.9 million ordinary shares at an average price of $75.56 per share. The Company has approximately $177.1 million remaining from its previously authorized share repurchase program.
 
On May 15, 2007, the Company settled the purchase contract component of its Equity Security Units originally issued on March 23, 2004, and also bought back all of its 2.53% Senior Notes due 2009 that formed a part thereof.  The settlement of the purchase contracts resulted in the issuance of approximately 10.8 million of the Companys ordinary shares.
 
On May 7, 2007, the Company issued $325 million of 6.25% Senior Notes.

The following is a reconciliation of the Companys (i) net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders to net income (loss) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax (which is a non-GAAP measure, the Exclusions) and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders equity (based on net income (loss) minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 (U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

Comment on Regulation G
This press release contains the presentation of (i) net income (loss) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax (the Exclusions) and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders equity.  These items are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G.  The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above.
XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XLs financial information in evaluating XLs performance.  This presentation includes the use of net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below).
Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XLs operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process.  In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization.  In this regard, certain users of XLs financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL generally holds its financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance of XLs financial guaranty operations. Unlike these credit derivatives, XLs weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business.
In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing net income (loss) exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XLs financial information to analyze XLs performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XLs financial information to evaluate XLs underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies who follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.

Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (ROE), excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax (the Exclusions),  is a widely used measure of any companys profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. The Company establishes target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Companys ROE return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, the Companys compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependant on the achievement of the Companys performance goals to enhance shareholder value which include ROE.
