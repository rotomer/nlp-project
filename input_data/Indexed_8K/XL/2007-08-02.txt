Item 8.01 Other Events.
XL Capital Ltd (the "Company") is filing this report to reaffirm its sub-prime exposure and clarify its collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs") exposures, each as at June 30, 2007. During the Company's second quarter 2007 earnings call of July 25, 2007, management stated that the Company's exposure to CDOs in the Company's investment portfolio of asset-backed securities ("ABS") was approximately $800 million as at June 30, 2007. Subsequent to the call, the Company has expanded its methodology for classifying CDOs, which now incorporates certain securities excluded under its previous definition. The Company continually reviews the classifications within its ABS portfolio given that industry data does not consistently differentiate between the various sub sectors. Using the Company's expanded approach, an additional $600 million of CDOs are captured, which would increase the Company's total exposure to CDOs in its investment portfolio to approximately $1.4 billion as at June 30, 2007. This r eclassification of certain ABS portfolio holdings has no impact, as at June 30, 2007, on (1) the Company's overall sub-prime exposure of approximately $1.2 billion; (2) the Company's asset-backed CDO exposure with a sub-prime component of approximately $100 million; or (3) the relative BBB component of the $1.4 billion CDO portfolio described above of approximately 20%.
