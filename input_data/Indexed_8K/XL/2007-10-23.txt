HAMILTON, BERMUDA, October 23, 2007 -- XL Capital Ltd (XL or the Company) (NYSE: XL) today reported net income available to ordinary shareholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 of $328.0 million, or $1.82 per ordinary share, compared with net income of $415.8 million, or $2.32 per ordinary share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2006.  Included in net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 are net realized losses on investments of $160.2 million and net realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments of $58.2 million.
 
Net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the third quarter of 2007 was a record $562.8 million, or $3.13 per ordinary share, compared with $468.7 million, or $2.61 per ordinary share, for the prior year period.

Defined as net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for Security Capital Assurance Ltd (SCA) and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates, herein referred to as net income excluding net realized gains and losses. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses is a non-GAAP measure.   See the schedule entitled Reconciliation at the end of this release for a reconciliation of net income/loss excluding net realized gains and losses to net income available to ordinary shareholders.
 
 
(SCA) as an affiliate, the Company has amended its definition of Net income excluding net realized gains and losses.  The definition now excludes the Companys share of net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for SCA and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates.  Net income excluding net realized gains and losses in prior periods has been amended to conform with the current period presentation. There was no effect on net income as a result of these changes.
 
For the first nine months of 2007, net income available to ordinary shareholders was a record $1.42 billion, or $7.89 per ordinary share, compared with $1.25 billion, or $6.98 per ordinary share, in the first nine months of 2006. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the same period was a record $1.63 billion, or $9.03 per ordinary share, as compared with $1.25 billion, or $6.95 per ordinary share, in the first nine months of 2006.
 
Return on ordinary shareholders' equity, based on net income was 13.0% and 19.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, respectively. Return on ordinary shareholders' equity, based on net income excluding net realized gains and losses was 22.3% and 22.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, respectively.
 
Commenting on the current quarter results, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. OHara said: I am proud to report that XL has again delivered to shareholders record operating results for both the quarter and year to date. All of our segments contributed to these excellent results. Our investment operations, in the face of challenging market conditions, generated solid net investment income and returns from investment fund affiliates.
 
At September 30, 2007, diluted book value per ordinary share was $56.29, as compared to $54.74 as at June 30, 2007.  Basic book value per ordinary share was $56.45 at September 30, 2007 as compared to $55.01 as at June 30, 2007.
 
 
SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS  THIRD QUARTER 2007 VERSUS THIRD QUARTER 2006
Insurance
 
Underwriting profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 was $129.7 million compared with $110.7 million in the prior year period.  This increase was due mainly to net favorable prior year development of $60.7 million, as compared to net favorable prior year development of $9.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was partially offset by lower net premiums earned of $1.01 billion compared to $1.02 billion in the prior year period.

Reinsurance
 
Underwriting profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 was $107.2 million compared with $117.0 million for the prior year period.  The decrease is principally due to lower premiums written and earned during the quarter in comparison to the prior year period. This decrease was partially offset by higher favorable net prior year development of $83.3 million as compared with $24.3 million in the prior year quarter.
 
 
 
 
Life Operations
 
Gross premiums written were $140.7 million compared with $113.4 million in the prior year quarter, principally due to growth in the core portfolio of regular premium business and favorable foreign exchange impacts.  Net income was $27.0 million as compared with $17.8 million in the third quarter last year.
 
Investment Operations
 
Net investment income from P&C operations, excluding investment income from Structured Products, increased 15.0% from the prior year period to $325.5 million primarily due to higher investment yields.  Net income from investment affiliates was $69.4 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared with $39.4 million in the third quarter of 2006.  Net income from investment manager affiliates increased to $23.2 million as compared to $9.1 million for the prior year period.

Total net realized losses on investments were $160.2 million in the quarter compared with net realized losses of $52.7 million in the prior year period.  This includes charges for other-than-temporary impairment of $110.9 million primarily related to the deterioration in the credit markets.  Most of these losses were borne by our Other Financial Lines operations, representing our muni-GIC and funding agreement businesses which are inherently more exposed to events in the credit markets.  Net realized losses on derivatives were $58.2 million compared to a gain in the prior year period of $0.6 million.  Net unrealized losses on investments, net of tax, were $452.2 million at September 30, 2007 compared with net unrealized losses of $309.9 million and net unrealized gains of $410.4 million at June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The increase in net unrealized losses of $142.3 million for the quarter and $862.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, was substantially due to widening credit spreads on corporate and structured credit investments, partially offset by the effect of declining U.S., U.K. and Euro-zone government interest rates.  The Company has also posted on its web-site Structured Credit data to provide detail on its exposures as at September 30, 2007.
 
Other Items
 
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 2.3 million ordinary shares at an average price of $76.66 per share.  Year to date, the Company has repurchased 13.2 million ordinary shares at an average price of $75.76 per share.  As at September 30, 2007, there were 179.7 million ordinary shares issued and outstanding.  The Company redeemed its Series A preference shares on August 14, 2007 and declared its first dividend on the Series E preference shares of $38.64 per share or $38.6 million payable October 15, 2007.
 
Total operating expenses were $270.5 million, a decrease from $276.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2006. The decrease is due to operating expenses of SCA included in the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher compensation costs for business development and performance-based programs, and the impact of foreign exchange.
 
Foreign exchange gains were $26.2 million compared with a loss of $21.9 million in the prior year quarter.

Comment on Regulation G
This press release contains the presentation of (i) net income (loss) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for SCA and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates (the Exclusions) and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders equity.  These items are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G.  The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above.
XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XLs financial information in evaluating XLs performance.  This presentation includes the use of net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax for the Company and its share of these items for SCA and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below).
Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XLs operations, and of those of SCA and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process.  In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other-than-temporary declines in value without actual realization.  In this regard, certain users of XLs financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL and its insurance company operating affiliates generally hold financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance. Unlike these credit derivatives, XLs weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business.
In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing net income (loss) exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XLs financial information to analyze XLs performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XLs financial information to evaluate XLs underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts
10
and certain rating agencies that follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.
Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (ROE), excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for SCA and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates (the Exclusions), is a widely used measure of any companys profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. The Company establishes target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Companys ROE return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, the Companys compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependant on the achievement of the Companys performance goals to enhance shareholder value which include ROE.
