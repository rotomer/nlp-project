In such event, if the payor has not in fact made such payment, then each of the payees severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to that payee with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the Agents cost of funds from such sources as the Agent may reasonably select.

16.8           The Guarantors (other than the Account Party) hereby agree, as between themselves, that if any such Guarantor shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor (as defined below) by reason of the payment by such Guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations, each other Guarantor (other than the Account Party) shall, on demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but subject to the next sentence), pay to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount equal to such Guarantors Pro Rata Share (as defined below and determined, for this purpose, without reference to the properties, debts and liabilities of such Excess Funding Guarantor) of the Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations.
