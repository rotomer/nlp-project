HAMILTON, BERMUDA, January 23, 2008  XL Capital Ltd ("XL" or the "Company") (NYSE: XL) today announced that it expects to record net income for the full-year 2007 of $200 million to $400 million and a net loss in the fourth quarter of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion.
XL expects to record the following items relating to credit market conditions in its financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2007:
In addition, under XL's guarantees issued to certain SCA subsidiaries and based on analysis performed by XL on the underlying SCA loss exposures together with the dual trigger aspect of these contracts, XL believes the probability of any loss under these guarantees is remote and accordingly, no loss reserves have been recorded. Concurrent with the issuance of this press release, XL is posting to its website details of its exposures under these guarantees and under certain facultative reinsurance agreements as of September 30, 2007.
XL expects to report net income for the fourth quarter of 2007, excluding the above items, in the range of $425 million to $475 million.
Including the impact of the above items, which is expected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, XL anticipates reporting a book value as of December 31, 2007 of approximately $50 per ordinary share reflecting the strength of XL's insurance and reinsurance operations.
All financial information contained in this release is unaudited and subject to revision pending the completion of the audits of XL, SCA and XL's other affiliates.
