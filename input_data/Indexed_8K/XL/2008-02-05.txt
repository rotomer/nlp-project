Defined as net income available to ordinary shareholders excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for Security Capital Assurance Ltd (SCA) and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates, herein referred to as net income excluding net realized gains and losses. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses is a non-GAAP measure.   See the schedule entitled Reconciliation at the end of this release for a reconciliation of net income/loss excluding net realized gains and losses to net income available to ordinary shareholders.
 
 
 
 
The net loss to ordinary shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 includes previously announced charges of $1.5 billion, net of tax, related to credit market conditions. (See attached table.)  Excluding these charges, net income available to ordinary shareholders was $439.9 million and $1.86 billion for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, net income available to ordinary shareholders was $360.4 million, or $2.01 per ordinary share, compared with $1.72 billion, or $9.60 per ordinary share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Net income excluding net realized gains and losses for the same period was $1.75 billion, or $9.72 per ordinary share, as compared with $1.76 billion, or $9.79 per ordinary share, for the twelve months ended  December 31, 2006.
 
Return on ordinary shareholders' equity was 3.9% and 19.6% for twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Return on ordinary shareholders' equity, based on net income excluding net realized gains and losses was 18.7% and 20.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
At December 31, 2007, diluted and basic book value per ordinary share was $51.16, as compared to diluted book value of $56.29 and basic book value of $56.45 as at September 30, 2007.
 
Commenting on the current quarter results, President, Chief Executive Officer and acting Chairman Brian M. OHara said:
 
I believe that these previously announced fourth quarter charges, while disappointing, have reduced uncertainty and increased investors ability to recognize the strength of XLs diversified and global insurance and reinsurance franchise, which continues to perform very well as evidenced by our full year combined ratio of 88.8%. In addition, our investment fund and manager affiliates have had another strong performance in 2007. We remain committed to building shareholder value as we execute our strategy.

Life Operations
 
Gross premiums written were $154.3 million compared with $207.1 million in the prior year quarter.  Contributing to the decrease was a $78.7 million single premium annuity contract that was included in the prior year quarter, which was partially offset by continued growth in the regular premium business.  The fourth quarter 2007 included a $25.4 million increase in policy and benefit reserves with respect to certain novated blocks of U.S.-based term-life mortality reinsurance business.  Contribution from life operations was $4.0 million as compared with $25.6 million in the fourth quarter last year.  Included in contribution for the current quarter is a foreign exchange loss of $3.9 million as compared with a foreign exchange gain of $2.5 million in the prior year quarter.
 
Investment Operations
 
Net investment income from P&C operations, excluding investment income from Structured Products, increased 15.0% from the prior year period to $326.8 million primarily due to higher investment yields.  Net income from investment affiliates was $70.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with $94.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Net loss from investment manager affiliates was $9.8 million as compared to net income of $49.7 million for the prior year period.
 
Total net realized losses on investments were $470.6 million, which includes $416.3 million for other than temporary impairments primarily related to deterioration in structured credit assets and $54.3 million from realized losses.
 
Net unrealized losses on investments, net of tax, were $332.5 million at December 31, 2007 compared with net unrealized losses, net of tax of $452.2 million at September 30, 2007 and net unrealized gains, net of tax, of $410.5 million at December 31, 2006, respectively. The decrease in net unrealized losses of $119.7 million for the quarter was substantially due to realized losses and charges for other than temporary impairments and declining U.S. and U.K. government interest rates.  This was partially offset by widening credit
 
 
 
 
spreads on corporate and structured credit investments.  The Company has also posted on its website Structured Credit data to provide detail on its exposures as at December 31, 2007.

Comment on Regulation G
This press release contains the presentation of (i) net income (loss) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for SCA and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates (the Exclusions) and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders equity (based on net income minus the Exclusions) to average ordinary shareholders equity.  These items are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G.  The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included above.
XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XLs financial information in evaluating XLs performance.  This presentation includes the use of net income excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax for the Company and its share of these items for SCA and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates. Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives (discussed further below).
Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XLs operations, and of those of SCA and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process.  In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other-than-temporary declines in value without actual realization.  In this regard, certain users of XLs financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely opportunistic and are a function of economic and interest rate conditions. In addition, with respect to credit derivatives, because XL and its insurance company operating affiliates generally hold financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies in the financial guarantee business) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance. Unlike these credit derivatives, XLs weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business.
In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing net income (loss) exclusive of the items mentioned above enables investors and other users of XLs financial information to analyze XLs performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XLs financial
 
 
 
information to evaluate XLs underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.
Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (ROE) excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit and investment derivative instruments, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for SCA and the Companys other insurance company operating affiliates (the Exclusions), is a widely used measure of any companys profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. The Company establishes target ROEs (minus the Exclusions) for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Companys ROE (minus the Exclusions) return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines. In addition, the Companys compensation of its senior officers is dependant upon, among other things, the achievement of the Companys performance goals to enhance shareholder value which include ROE (minus the Exclusions).
