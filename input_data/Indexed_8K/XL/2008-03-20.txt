The Stock Options will have an exercise price per share equal to the closing price per ordinary Company share on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant (which date of grant will be the last day of the first week of the Executive 19;s employment), and they will be scheduled to vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant.

Conformed Copy
AGREEMENT, made and entered into as of March 14, 2008 by and between, XL Capital Ltd, a Cayman Islands corporation (the "Company"), and Michael S. McGavick (the "Executive").
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive each desire that the Executive become employed by the Company and that the terms and conditions of such employment be memorialized by a written agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the Company, the Guarantors (as hereinafter defined) and the Executive (the "Parties") agree as follows:
1. EMPLOYMENT.
The Company hereby employs the Executive, and the Executive hereby accepts employment with the Company, for the term of this Agreement as set forth in Section 2, below, in the position and with duties and responsibilities set forth in Section 3, below, and upon such other terms and conditions as are hereinafter stated.
2. TERM OF EMPLOYMENT.
The stated term of employment under this Agreement shall commence on the later of May 1, 2008 or the date the work permit referred to in Section 3(c) below is obtained (such later date is referred to herein as the "Start Date") and shall continue through the close of business on the first anniversary of the Start Date, subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 8, below, and extension as provided in the next succeeding sentence. On the first anniversary of the Start Date and on each anniversary thereafter, the stated term of employment shall be automatically extended for an additional one year unless the Company gives notice in writing to the Executive or the Executive gives notice in writing to the Company at least six months prior to such anniversary that the term is not to be so extended.
3. POSITIONS, DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
(a) GENERAL. The Executive shall be employed as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In such position, the Executive shall have the duties, responsibilities and authority normally associated with the office, position and titles of such an officer of an insurance, reinsurance and financial services company, or holding company, whose shares are publicly traded in the United States. In carrying out his duties and responsibilities, the Executive shall report to the Board of Directors of the Company. During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall devote his full business time to the business and affairs of the Company, and shall use his best efforts, skills and abilities to promote the Company's interests.
(b) PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. The Executive's services under this Agreement, which are global in nature, shall be performed at the Company's headquarters in Bermuda or at such other location or locations reasonably requested by the Company; , that such services will be performed outside the United States and in accordance with the guidelines established by the Company from time to time for the location of the performance of services on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Executive acknowledges that the Company may require the Executive to travel to the extent such travel is reasonably necessary to perform the services hereunder and that such travel may be extensive. To the extent reasonably requested by the Company, the Executive shall allocate greater business time to a location other than his principal business location, and if reasonably requested by the Company, the Executive shall relocate to such other locations. Any such relocation will not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement.
provided, however
(c) WORK PERMITS. The employment of the Executive by the Company shall be contingent upon the issuance to the Executive of a suitable (for the purposes of the Executive's contemplated employment by the Company) work permit by the Bermuda government authorities and any other permits required by any Bermuda government authority. Both the Company and the Executive shall use their respective best efforts to obtain, maintain and renew said permit(s) so as to allow the Executive to be employed under the terms hereof. The Company shall be responsible for permit fees. If at any time said permit(s), having been obtained, expire and are not renewed or cease to be valid and such renewal or validation is necessary in order for the Executive to be employed by the Company as contemplated by this Agreement and the non-renewal or invalidation is beyond the control of both the Company and the Executive, employment under this Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the expiration of said permit(s) or upon said permit(s) ceasing to be valid unless the Executive can discharge his duties and responsibilities effectively from another location not requiring said permit(s) that is reasonably acceptable to the Executive and non-prejudicial to the interests of the Company. In the event of such termination, the provisions of Section 8(d) shall apply to such termination of the Executive's employment (or, if within (i) the one-year period prior to the date of a Change in Control, as hereinafter defined, provided the conditions set forth in the last paragraph of Section 8(d)(iii) are satisfied, or (ii) the Post-Change Period, as hereinafter defined, such termination shall, in the case of clauses (i) or (ii), be considered a termination by the employee for "Good Reason") provided that non-renewal of said permit(s) or invalidation thereof are not a direct result of any material action or omission of the Executive that would reasonably cause such permit(s) not to be renewed or validated.
4. BASE SALARY.
The Executive shall be paid a Base Salary by the Company equal to US $1 million per annum, payable in accordance with the Company's regular pay practices. Such Base Salary shall be subject to annual review in accordance with the Company's practices for executives as in effect from time to time and may be increased at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Compensation Committee").

In addition to the Base Salary provided for in Section 4, above, the Executive shall be eligible for an annual cash bonus under the Company's Annual Incentive Compensation Plan as in effect from time to time, with a target annual bonus opportunity equal to 200% of his Base Salary. The Executive may be awarded such annual bonuses thereunder as may be approved by the Compensation Committee based on corporate, individual and business unit performance measures, as appropriate, established or approved from time to time, by the Compensation Committee. Any annual bonus shall be paid in cash in a lump sum after the end of the calendar year for which the annual bonus is paid and no later than March 15 following such calendar year, unless deferred at the Executive's option in accordance with the provisions of any applicable deferred compensation plan of the Company or it subsidiaries in effect from time to time. The Executive's target annual bonus for calendar year 2008 will be prorated by multiplying the target annual bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from the Start Date until December 31, 2008 and the denominator of which is 365; that the Executive's minimum annual bonus for calendar year 2008 shall be 50% of the Executive's Base Salary earned for calendar year 2008. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence for calendar year 2008, nothing in this Section 5 shall confer upon the Executive any right to a minimum annual bonus.

(G) full and immediate vesting under the Company's retirement plans as of the date of termination, to the extent permitted by applicable law; , that if such full and immediate vesting cannot be provided under a "qualified employer plan" (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(a)(2)) under applicable law, then the present value of economically equivalent benefits, determined using reasonable assumptions and on an after-tax basis to the Executive, shall be paid in a cash lump sum to the Executive, subject to Section 25 below, 60 days after termination of employment.
provided, however
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits described in (A)-(G) above, if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company (other than for Cause) within one year prior to the date on which a "409A Change in Control" (as defined below) occurs, and it is reasonably demonstrated that such termination (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated or intended to effect the 409A Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of the 409A Change in Control; , that in such event, amounts in excess of those otherwise payable to the Executive under Section 8(d)(ii) above will be payable hereunder only following the 409A Change in Control (and, subject to Section 25 below,10 days thereafter). For purposes hereof, a "409A Change in Control" means a "change in control event" (as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)) with respect to the Company that also constitutes a Change in Control.
provided, however
(iv) If, in situations where Section 8(d)(iii) does not apply, at any time during the term of the Executive's employment hereunder and without the Executive's written consent, duties are assigned to the Executive that are materially inconsistent with his position as described in Section 3 above, or the Company does not cure any material breach by it of any provision of Sections 4 through 7 of this Agreement within 30 calendar days following written notice of same by the Executive (which written notice must be given within 30 calendar days after such breach), the Executive shall have the right to terminate his employment within 30 calendar days of the Company's failure to rescind such assignment in accordance with the proviso below or of such failure to cure a breach, as the case may be, and such termination shall be deemed a termination by the Company without Cause under Section 8(d)(ii), above, , in the case of assignment of duties that are materially inconsistent with those set forth in Section 3 above, the Executive shall have given the Company written notice of such assignment within 30 calendar days of such assignment and shall not, within 30 calendar days thereafter, have had the assignment of inconsistent duties rescinded.
provided
(e) VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY THE EXECUTIVE. The Executive may voluntarily terminate his employment prior to the expiration of the term of this Agreement upon at least three months' prior written notice to the Company. Such termination shall constitute a voluntary termination and, except as provided in Section 8(d)(iii) or Section 8(d)(iv), above, in such event the Executive shall be limited to the same rights and benefits as applicable to a termination by the Company for Cause as provided in Section 8(c), above. A voluntary termination in accordance with this Section 8(e) shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement. A termination of the Executive's employment due to disability or death as described in Section 8(b) or 8(a), above, a termination by the Executive which the Executive is entitled to treat as a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8(d), above, or a termination by the Executive under Section 8(d)(iv), above, shall not be deemed a voluntary termination within the meaning of this Section 8(e).
9. EXCISE TAX PAYMENTS.
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that (i) any payment or distribution made, or benefit provided (including, without limitation, the acceleration of any payment, distribution or benefit or accelerated vesting or exercisability of any award) by the Company, any acquirer or any party related to the Company or the acquirer to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (or any successor provision or similar excise tax), or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), (ii) the aggregate amount of the Executive's Parachute Payments (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) is less than 3.25 times the Executive's Base Amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Code), and (iii) no such Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax if the payments set forth in Section 8(d)(iii)(B) and (C) hereof were each reduced by up to 20 percent, then the payments set forth in Section 8(d)(iii)(B) and (C) will each be reduced to the smallest extent possible (and in no event by more than 20 percent in the aggregate) such that no Payment is subject to the Excise Tax.
(b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that (i) the aggregate amount of the Executive's Parachute Payments equals or exceeds 3.25 times the Executive's Base Amount, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Executive's Parachute Payments is less than 3.25 times the Base Amount but one or more Payments would be subject to the Excise Tax even if the payments set forth in Section 8(d)(iii)(B) and (C) hereof were each reduced by 20 percent, or (iii) notwithstanding a reduction in payments pursuant to Section 9(a) above, an Excise Tax is payable by the Executive on one or more Payments, then, in any such case, Payments shall not be reduced and the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any income or Excise Tax) imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes, the Executive retains from the Gross-Up Payment an amount equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.
(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 9(d), all determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including determination of whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and of the amount of any such Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by a nationally recognized public accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within l5 business days of the date of termination of the Executive's employment, if applicable, or such earlier time as is reasonably requested. The initial Gross-Up Payment, if any, as determined pursuant to this Section 9(c), shall be paid to the Executive within five business days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion that he has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his Federal income tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm meeting the requirements of this Section 9(c) shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive, subject only to payments pursuant to the following sentence based on a determination that additional Gross-Up Payments should have been made, consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder (the amount of such additional payments are referred to herein as the "Gross-Up Underpayment"). In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 9(d) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Gross-Up Underpayment that has occurred and any such Gross-Up Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Company.
(d) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the United States Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Executive of any Excise Tax and, therefore, the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but not later than 30 business days after the Executive receives written notice of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires, in good faith, to contest such claim (which notice shall set forth the bases for such contest) and that it will bear the costs and provide the indemnification as required by this sentence, the Executive shall, in good faith:
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
(ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall, in good faith, reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive,
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
(iv) permit the Company to participate, in good faith, in any proceedings relating to such claim;
, , that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis to the Executive, for any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation and payment of all costs and expenses.
provided
however
Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(d), the Company shall, exercising good faith, control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option (but in good faith), may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option (but in good faith), either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , ,that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis to the Executive, from any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to the payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(d), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(d)) promptly pay to the Company, as the case may be, the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(d), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then any obligation of the Executive to repay such advance shall be forgiven and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
provided
however
and
further
provided
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Executive's failure to strictly comply with the notice provisions set forth in this Section 9, so long as such failure does not prevent the Company from contesting an excise tax claim, shall not adversely affect the Executive's rights under this Section 9. Any amount advanced shall be deemed a nonrefundable payment to the extent a refundable advance would be a violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, except as otherwise provided in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v), in no event shall any payment by the Company pursuant to this Section 9 be made later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which he remits the related taxes.
10. NO MITIGATION; NO OFFSET.
In the event of any termination of employment under Section 8, above, the Executive shall be under no obligation to mitigate damages or seek other employment, and, except as expressly set forth herein, there shall be no offset against amounts due the Executive under this Agreement on account of any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that he may obtain.
11. NONCOMPETITION AND NONSOLICITATION.
The Executive represents and warrants that, to the best of his knowledge, he is not using the confidential or proprietary information of any other person in violation of any agreement or rights of others known to him. The Executive agrees that the products of the Company and its Affiliates shall constitute the exclusive property of the Company and its Affiliates.
For the avoidance of doubt, all trademarks, policy language or forms, products or services (including products and services under development), trade names, trade secrets, service marks, designs, computer programs and software, utility models, copyrights, know-how and confidential information, applications for registration of any of the foregoing and the right to apply for them in any part of the world (whether any of the foregoing shall be registered or unregistered) created or discovered or participated in by the Executive during the course of his employment (whether or not pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) or under the instructions of the Company or its Affiliates are and shall be the absolute property of the Company and its Affiliates, as appropriate. Without limiting the foregoing, the Executive hereby assigns to the Company any and all of the Executive's right, title and interest, if any, pertaining to the insurance and reinsurance (including, without limitation, finite insurance and reinsurance), risk assumption, risk management, brokerage, financial and other products or services developed or improved upon by the Executive (including, without limitation, any related "know-how") while employed by the Company or its Affiliates, including any patent, trademark, trade name, copyright, ownership or other right that may pertain thereto.
Since Executive has obtained and is likely to obtain in the course of Executive's employment with the Company and its Affiliates knowledge of trade names, trade secrets, know-how, products and services (including products and services under development), techniques, methods, lists, computer programs and software and other confidential information relating to the Company and its Affiliates, and their employees, clients, business or business opportunities, Executive hereby undertakes that:
(i) Executive will not (either alone or jointly with or on behalf of others and whether directly or indirectly) encourage, entice, solicit or endeavor to encourage, entice or solicit away from employment with the Company or its Affiliates, or hire or cause to be hired, any officer or employee of the Company or its Affiliates (or any individual who was within the prior twelve months an officer or employee of the Company or its Affiliates), or encourage, entice, solicit or endeavor to encourage, entice or solicit any individual to violate the terms of any employment agreement or arrangement between such individual and the Company or any of its Affiliates;
(ii) Executive will not (either alone or jointly with or on behalf of others and whether directly or indirectly) interfere with or disrupt or seek to interfere with or disrupt (A) the relationships between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any customer or client of the Company and its Affiliates, on the other hand, (including any insured or reinsured party) who during the period of twenty-four months immediately preceding such termination shall have been such a customer or client, or (B) the supply to the Company and its Affiliates of any services by any supplier or agent or broker who during the period of twenty-four months immediately preceding such termination shall have supplied services to any such person, nor will Executive interfere or seek to interfere with the terms on which such supply or agency or brokering services during such period as aforesaid have been made or provided; and
(iii) Executive will not (either alone or jointly with or on behalf of others and whether directly or indirectly) whether as an employee, consultant, partner, principal, agent, distributor, representative or stockholder (except solely as a less than one percent stockholder of a publicly traded company), engage in any activities in Bermuda, the United States or greater London if such activities are competitive with the businesses that (i) are then being conducted by the Company or its Affiliates and (ii) during the period of the Executive's employment were either being conducted by the Company or its Affiliates or actively being developed by the Company or its Affiliates.
The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall continue as long as the Executive is employed by the Company or its Affiliates and such provisions shall continue in effect after such employment is terminated for any reason until the first anniversary of such termination, provided that if such employment is terminated by the Company under Section 8(d)(iii) or by the Executive under Section 8(d)(iii), the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) shall automatically terminate upon such termination of employment, unless the Company elects, in writing, upon such termination to continue the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) in effect through the six-month anniversary of such termination of employment in which case the Company shall be obligated to pay the Executive, in addition to any of the Executive's rights under Section 8(d)(iii), a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (x) six months of his Base Salary and (y) one half of the Executive's average annual bonus payable by the Company or its subsidiaries for the three years (or shorter period of employment by any of such entities) immediately preceding the year of termination, and such lump sum payment shall, subject to Section 25 below, be made 60 days following his "separation from service" (within the meaning Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)) with the Company.
For purposes of this Agreement, an "Affiliate" of the Company includes any person, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company, and such term shall specifically include, without limitation, the Company's majority-owned subsidiaries.
The limitations on the Executive set forth in this Section shall also apply to any agent or other representative acting on behalf of Executive.
While the restrictions aforesaid are considered by both parties to be reasonable in all the circumstances it is recognized that restrictions of the nature in question may fail for reasons unforeseen and accordingly it is hereby declared and agreed that if any of such restrictions or the geographic or other scope thereof shall be adjudged to be void as going beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of the interests of the Company and its Affiliates but would be valid if part of the wording thereof were deleted and/or the periods (if any) thereof reduced and/or geographic or other area dealt with thereby reduced in scope then said restrictions shall apply with such modifications as may be necessary to make them valid and effective.
Nothing contained in this Section 11 shall limit in any manner any additional obligations to which Executive may be bound pursuant to any other agreement or any applicable law, rule or regulation and Section 11 shall apply, subject to its terms, after employment has terminated for any reason.
12. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
The Executive covenants that he shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, use for the Executive's own benefit or the benefit of any other person or entity other than the Company and its Affiliates or disclose to any person, other than an employee of the Company or other person to whom disclosure is necessary to the performance by the Executive of his duties in the employ of the Company, any confidential, proprietary, secret, or privileged information about the Company or its Affiliates or their business or operations, including, but not limited to, information concerning trade secrets, know-how, software, data processing systems, policy language and forms, inventions, designs, processes, formulae, notations, improvements, financial information, business plans, prospects, referral sources, lists of suppliers and customers, legal advice and other information with respect to the affairs, business, clients, customers, agents or other business relationships of the Company or its Affiliates. Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret, confidential proprietary or privileged information or data relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates or predecessor companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by Executive during his employment, unless and until such information has become known to the public generally (other than as a result of unauthorized disclosure by the Executive) or unless he is required to disclose such information by a court or by a governmental body with apparent authority to require such disclosure. The foregoing covenant by the Executive shall be without limitation as to time and geographic application and this Section 12 shall apply in accordance with its terms after employment has terminated for any reason. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he shall have no authority to waive any attorney-client or other privilege without the express prior written consent of the Compensation Committee as evidenced by the signature of the Company's General Counsel.
13. WITHHOLDING.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to be made by the Company hereunder to the Executive shall be subject to withholding of such amounts relating to taxes as the Company may reasonably determine should be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. In lieu of withholding such amounts, in whole or in part, the Company may, in its sole discretion, accept other provision for payment of taxes as required by law, provided it is satisfied that all requirements of law affecting its responsibilities to withhold such taxes have been satisfied.
14. GUARANTY AND AFFILIATE SERVICES.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is deemed on the date of his "separation from service" (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.

Section 1.409A-1(i)), then with regard to any payment that is required to be delayed pursuant to Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, such payment shall not be made prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of his "separation from service," or (ii) the date of his death (the "Delay Period"). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments delayed pursuant to this Section 25 (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum, and any remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. In no case will compliance with this Section by the Company constitute a breach of the Company's or the Guarantors' obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of Sections 8(b) and 8(d) above, the Executive will be deemed to have terminated his employment on the date of his "separation from service" (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)) with the Company. With respect to any reimbursement or in-kind benefit arrangements of the Company provided for herein that constitute deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the following conditions shall be applicable: (i) the amount eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, under any such arrangement in one calendar year may not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, under such arrangement in any other calendar year (except that the health and dental plans may impose a limit on the amount that may be reimbursed or paid if such limit is imposed on all participants), (ii) any reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred, and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

(iv) if there occurs an Event involving the Company as a result of which 25% of more of the members of the Board of the Company are not persons who were members of the Board immediately prior to the earlier of (x) the Event, (y) execution of an agreement, the consummation of which would result in the Event, or (z) announcement by the Company of an intention to effect the Event; or

(iv) Any breach by the Company or the Guarantors of any provision of this Agreement or any agreements entered into pursuant thereto that remains uncured for 20 calendar days following written notice of same by the Executive;
(v) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3(b) of this Agreement, requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location that is greater than 35 miles from the office or location at which the Executive was principally located immediately prior to the Change in Control;

(vii) The failure by the Company to pay within 7 calendar days of the due date any amounts due under any benefit or compensation plan, including any deferred compensation plan.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Executive must give written notice of his intention to terminate his employment for Good Reason within sixty (60) days after the act or omission which constitutes Good Reason, and any failure to give such written notice within such period will result in a waiver by the Executive of his right to terminate for Good Reason as a result of such act or omission.

HAMILTON, BERMUDA, March 17, 2008  XL Capital Ltd ("XL" or the "Company") (NYSE: XL) today named Mr. Michael S. McGavick as its next Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. McGavick is scheduled to join the Company on May 1 replacing Mr. Brian M. O'Hara, Chief Executive Officer for the last 13 years, who announced in October 2007 that he would retire as CEO by mid-2008. To provide continuity during the transition, Mr. O'Hara, who is currently serving as Acting Chairman of XL's Board of Directors, will serve as Chairman during the final year of his current term on the Board which expires in April 2009.
Mr. McGavick, whose appointment is subject to immigration approval from the Government of Bermuda, was President & CEO of the Seattle-based Safeco Corporation (NYSE: SAF) from January 2001 to December 2005. Prior to joining Safeco, Mr. McGavick spent six years with the Chicago-based CNA Financial Corporation, where he held various senior executive positions before becoming President and Chief Operating Officer of the company's largest commercial insurance operating unit. Mr. McGavick's insurance industry experience also includes two years as Director of the American Insurance Association's Superfund Improvement Project in Washington D.C. where he became the Association's lead strategist in working to transform US Superfund environmental laws. Most recently Mr. McGavick ran for a seat in the US Senate in the state of Washington.
XL Lead Director Mr. Robert R. Glauber, who chaired the Company's CEO Succession Committee, said: "Mike is an extremely talented insurance executive with experience leading Safeco and, before that, the commercial lines business at CNA. The Succession Committee believes he is not only capable of meeting the high standards set by Brian O'Hara but will be successful in transforming XL to meet the challenges of our next decade."
Commenting on the selection of an external candidate, Mr. Glauber added: "While the Company has extremely talented and capable internal candidates, the Committee decided that XL, having been led by one of its founding executives for 13 years, would benefit most from an external perspective at the top level of leadership."
Mr. McGavick said: "XL is known for its underwriting excellence and a values-based culture of integrity, both of which have been developed under Brian's leadership. These are the very differentiating characteristics with which I closely identify and I am proud to have been chosen as the Company's next CEO. XL is a world class brand with very successful insurance, reinsurance and life reinsurance businesses and I look forward to helping it realize its full potential."
Mr. O'Hara said: "Like our Board of Directors, I am very excited to have Mike McGavick joining us. I have known Mike for many years, both as a colleague and as a customer and I am very pleased that we have selected a candidate of his caliber. He is a leader who fully understands the challenges of a complex organization and the importance of a strategy which plays to your strengths. I'm looking forward to working with him."
XL Capital Ltd, through its operating subsidiaries, is a leading provider of global insurance and reinsurance coverages to industrial, commercial and professional service firms, insurance companies and other enterprises on a worldwide basis.
