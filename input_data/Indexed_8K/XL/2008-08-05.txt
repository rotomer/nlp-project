The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any $1,000 integral multiple thereof except that an interest in a Note held as part of a Normal Unit represents an ownership interest of 1/40th, or 2.5%, of a Note in aggregate principal amount of $1,000 and will therefore correspond to the stated amount of $25 per Normal Unit. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series so issued are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     
The Notes were initially issued as components of the Company's 10.75% Equity Security Units that are in the form of Normal Units, each such Normal Unit initially consisting of (a) a stock purchase contract (each, a "") under which (i) the Holder will agree to purchase from the Company on August 15, 2011, a specified number of newly issued Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company and (ii) the Company will pay to the Holder quarterly contract adjustment payments and (b) a 1/40, or 2.5%, ownership interest in a Note of $1,000 principal amount.

On or prior to the Optional Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Optional Redemption Date, the aggregate Redemption Price for the Notes being redeemed.

calendar year, then payment will be on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on that payment date.
     
Notice of any redemption (which notice will be irrevocable) will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the date of redemption (the "") to each registered Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address as more fully provided in the Indenture.

(iii) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units, shall be received by the Purchase Contract Agent or the Holders of any of the Units when such payment or distribution is prohibited pursuant to Section 5.2(e) through Section 5.2(q), such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

(i) (i) Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all such Contract Adjustment Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments owing on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by virtue of Section 5.2(e) through Section 5.2(q) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Section 5.2(e) through Section 5.2(q) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.
          
(j) Nothing contained in Section 5.2(e) through Section 5.2(q) or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Units is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which, subject to the occurrence of a Termination Event as described in Section 5.2(b) and the Company's right pursuant to Section 5.3 to defer Contract Adjustment Payments, is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under these Section 5.2(e) through Section 5.2(q), of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.

(n) Each Holder of Units, by his acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Purchase Contract Agent on his, her or its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in Section 5.2(e) through Section 5.2(q) and appoints the Purchase Contract Agent his, her or its attorney-in-fact, as the case may be, for any and all such purposes.
          
(o) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.2.

provided
that, if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section 5.2(o), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Purchase Contract Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to or on or after such date.
          
(p) The Purchase Contract Agent in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section 5.2 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness at the time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive the Purchase Contract Agent of any of its rights as such holder.

Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Purchase Contract Agent. If any Ordinary Shares issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered, no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of such Certificate or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable.

SECTION 5.6 .
Adjustment of Settlement Rate
          
(a) Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc.
     
(1) Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company: (A) pays a dividend or makes another distribution to all holders of the Company's Ordinary Shares payable exclusively in Ordinary Shares on the Company's Ordinary Shares; (B) subdivides or splits the outstanding Ordinary Shares into a greater number of shares; or (C) combines the outstanding Ordinary Shares into a smaller number of shares, then the Fixed Settlement Rates in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the Holder of a Purchase Contract forming a part of a Unit thereafter settled may receive the number of Ordinary Shares which such Holder would have owned immediately following such action if such Holder had settled the Purchase Contract immediately prior to such action.
     
The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend, distribution or subdivision and immediately after the effective date in the case of a combination.
     
(2) Adjustment for Rights Issue. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company distributes any rights, options or warrants to all holders of the Company's Ordinary Shares entitling them to purchase or subscribe for, for a period expiring within 60 days, Ordinary Shares at a price per share less than the Current Market Price as of the Time of Determination (except that no adjustment will be made if Holders of the Units may participate in the distribution on a basis and with the notice that the Company's Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate), each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
where:
     
R' = the applicable adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate.
     
R = the applicable current Fixed Settlement Rate.
     
O = the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 5.6(a)(2) is being applied.
     
N = the number of additional Ordinary Shares offered pursuant to the distribution.
     
P = the offering price per share of the additional shares.
     
M = the Current Market Price.
     
The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive the rights, warrants or options to which this Section 5.6(a)(2) applies. If all of the Ordinary Shares subject to such rights, warrants or options have not been issued when such rights, warrants or options expire, then the Fixed Settlement Rates shall promptly be readjusted to the Fixed Settlement Rates which would then be in effect
had the adjustment upon the issuance of such rights, warrants or options been made on the basis of the actual number of Ordinary Shares issued upon the exercise of such rights, warrants or options. No adjustment shall be made under this Section 5.6(a)(2) if the application of the formula stated above in this Section 5.6(a)(2) would result in a value of R' that is equal to or less than the value of R.
     
(3) Adjustments for Other Distributions. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company dividends or distributes to all holders of its Ordinary Shares any of its debt, Capital Stock, securities or assets or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company (including securities or cash, but excluding (x) distributions of Capital Stock referred to in Section 5.6(a)(1)(A) and distributions of rights, warrants or options referred to in Section 5.6(a)(2) and (y) dividends or distributions that are paid exclusively in cash) each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted, subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of this Section 5.6(a)(3), in accordance with the formula:
where:
     
R' = the applicable adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate.
     
R = the applicable current Fixed Settlement Rate.
     
M = the Current Market Price.
     
F = the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 5.6(a)(3) applies) of the debt, Capital Stock, assets, securities, rights, warrants or options to be distributed in respect of each Ordinary Share in the distribution to which this Section 5.6(a)(3) is being applied (including, in the case of cash dividends or other cash distributions giving rise to an adjustment, all such cash distributed concurrently).
     
In the event the Company distributes shares of Capital Stock of a subsidiary, the Fixed Settlement Rates will be adjusted, if at all, based on the market value of the subsidiary stock so distributed relative to the market value of the Ordinary Shares, as discussed below. The Board of Directors shall determine fair market values for the purposes of this Section 5.6(a)(3), except that in respect of a dividend or other distribution of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a ""), the fair market value of the securities to be distributed shall equal the average of the daily Closing Prices of those securities for the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the sixth day of trading of those securities after the effectiveness of the Spin-off. In the event, however, that an underwritten initial public offering of the securities in the Spin-off occurs simultaneously with the Spin-off, fair market value of the securities distributed in the Spin-off shall mean the initial public offering price of such securities and the Current Market Price shall mean the Closing Price for the Ordinary Shares on the same Trading Day.
Spin-off
     
The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive the distribution to which this Section 5.6(a)(3) applies, except that an adjustment related to a Spin-off shall become effective at the earlier to occur of (i) 10 Trading Days after the effective date of the Spin-off and (ii) the initial public offering of the securities distributed in the Spin-off.
     
(4) Cash Distributions. In case the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than distributions by the Company's subsidiaries solely to the Company) shall, by dividend or otherwise, pay regular quarterly, semi-annual or annual cash dividends or make any other distributions consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of its Ordinary Shares, excluding any cash dividend or distribution on the Ordinary Shares to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend or distribution per Ordinary Share in any quarter does not exceed $0.19 (the "") (the Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever there are adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates; that no adjustment shall be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (4)), then, in such case, the Fixed Settlement Rates in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on such date less the amount of cash so distributed applicable to one Ordinary Share in excess of the Dividend Threshold Amount; and the denominator shall be the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on such date, such adjustment to be effective at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one Ordinary Share in excess of the Dividend Threshold Amount is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on such date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder of a Unit shall have the right to receive upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts such excess amount. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Fixed Settlement Rates shall again be adjusted to be the Fixed Settlement Rates that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

(5) Adjustment for Company Tender Offer. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company or any subsidiary of the Company pays holders of the Ordinary Shares in respect of a tender or exchange offer, other than an odd-lot offer, by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for Ordinary Shares to the extent that the cash and the value of any other consideration included in the payment per Ordinary Share (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution) exceeds the average closing price of the Ordinary Shares for each of the five consecutive Trading Days next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made under such tender or exchange offer (the ""), each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the Expiration Time shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which:
Expiration Time
(A) the numerator shall be equal to the sum of (1) the fair market value, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors (whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution), of the aggregate consideration payable for all Ordinary Shares that the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, purchased in such tender or exchange offer (the
"") and (2) the product of (x) the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding at the Expiration Time, less any Purchased Shares, and (y) the Closing Price of the Ordinary Shares on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, and
Purchased Shares
(B) the denominator shall be equal to the product of the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding at the Expiration Time, including the Purchased Shares, and the Closing Price of the Ordinary Shares on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time;
such adjustment to become effective at the opening of business on the Business Day following the date of the Expiration Time.
.
     
(6) Calculation of Adjustments. All adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of an Ordinary Share (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or a decrease of at least one percent; that any adjustments not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment and notwithstanding whether or not such one percent threshold shall have been met, all such adjustments shall be made on the Stock Purchase Date. If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Settlement Rates pursuant to paragraph (1) through (5) or (7) of this Section 5.6(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Settlement Rate in Section 5.1(a) will apply on the Stock Purchase Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the applicable Fixed Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1) through (5) or (7) of this Section 5.6(a) and the denominator of which shall be the applicable Fixed Settlement Rate immediately before such adjustment; that if such adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1) through (5) or (7) of this Section 5.6(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Fixed Settlement Rates.
provided
provided
     
(7) Increase of Settlement Rate. The Company may make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of Ordinary Shares resulting from any dividend or distribution of Capital Stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons.
     
(8) When No Adjustment Required. No adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates need be made as a result of: (i) the issuance of the rights; (ii) the distribution of separate certificates representing the rights; (iii) the exercise or redemption of the rights in accordance with any rights agreement; or (iv) the termination or invalidation of the rights, in each case, pursuant to the Company's stockholders rights plan existing on the date of this Agreement, as amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time or any newly adopted stockholders rights
plans; that to the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect upon settlement of a Purchase Contract, the Holder shall receive, in addition to the Ordinary Shares, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to any settlement of a Purchase Contract, the rights have separated from the Ordinary Shares, in which case the Fixed Settlement Rates will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company made a distribution to all holders of its Ordinary Shares as described in clause (3) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the rights. In addition, no adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates need be made:
provided, however
(A) upon the issuance of any Ordinary Shares pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in Ordinary Shares under any plan;
(B) upon the issuance of any Ordinary Shares or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or
(C) upon the issuance of any Ordinary Shares pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Units were first issued.
     
No adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates need be made for a transaction referred to in 5.6(a)(2) or 5.6(a)(3) if Holders of the Units may participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Ordinary Shares participate in the transaction. No adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Ordinary Shares.
     
(9) Use of Terms. "" means the time and date of the earlier of (i) the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights, warrants or options or a distribution in each case, to which Section 5.6(a)(2) or Section 5.6(a)(3) applies and (ii) the time ("") immediately prior to the commencement of "ex-dividend" trading for such rights, warrants or options or distribution on the NYSE or such other U.S. national or regional exchange or market on which the Ordinary Shares are then listed or quoted.
Time of Determination
Ex-Dividend Time
     
"" means the average of the Closing Prices of the Ordinary Shares for the five consecutive Trading Day period ending on the third Business Day ending on the earlier of the day in question and the day before the "ex date" with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such computation. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the Ordinary Shares trade regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive the issuance or distribution.
Current Market Price
     
(b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event.
          
(i) In the event of
(1) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation are not exchanged for cash, securities other property of the Company or another corporation),
(2) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety,
(3) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or any binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Ordinary Shares, or
(4) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any such event, a ""),
Reorganization Event
each Ordinary Share covered by each Purchase Contract forming part of a Unit immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, after such Reorganization Event, be converted for purposes of the Purchase Contract into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon which have a record date that is prior to the Stock Purchase Date) per Ordinary Share by a holder of Ordinary Shares that (i) is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a ""), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Ordinary Shares held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates, and (ii) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event ( that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each Ordinary Share held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised (""), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each Non-electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per Ordinary Share by a plurality of the Non-electing Shares). On the Stock Purchase Date, the Settlement Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on the Stock Purchase Date of such securities, cash or other property.
Constituent Person
provided
Non-electing Share
In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the
Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each Outstanding Unit shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.6. Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
(ii) If a Fundamental Change occurs prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then each Holder of a Unit shall have the right to accelerate and settle ("") the Purchase Contract contained in such Unit upon the conditions set forth below at the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate; provided that no Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii) unless, at the time such Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (y) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement. In the event that a Holder elects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement and a Registration Statement is required to be effective in connection with the exercise of such Fundamental Change Early Settlement but no such Registration Statement is then effective, the Holder's election shall be void unless and until such a Registration Statement becomes effective.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement
If a Holder elects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement of some or all of its Purchase Contracts, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, the aggregate amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments including and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, with respect to such Purchase Contracts. The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by such Holder to effect such Fundamental Change Early Settlement.
The "" shall be determined by reference to the table set forth below, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the "") and the stock price (the "") in the Fundamental Change, which means: (A) in the case of a Fundamental Change described in clause (ii) of the definition of such term where holders of the Ordinary Shares receive only cash in the Fundamental Change, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share; or (B) otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Closing Price of the Ordinary Shares over the

The following table sets forth the Stock Price and Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate per $25 of Stated Amount of Units:
The exact Stock Prices and Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:
(A) if the Stock Price on the Effective Date is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amount and the earlier and later Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(B) if the actual Stock Price on the Effective Date exceeds $100.00 per Ordinary Share, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate will be the Minimum Settlement Rate; and
(C) if the actual Stock Price on the Effective Date is less than $10.00 per Ordinary Share, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate will be the Maximum Settlement Rate.
The Stock Prices set forth in the first column of the table above shall be adjusted as of any date on which any Fixed Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6 hereof. The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the applicable Fixed Settlement Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of
which is the Fixed Settlement Rate as so adjusted. The number of Ordinary Shares set forth in the table above will be adjusted in the same manner as the Fixed Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6 hereof.
Within five Business Days of the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Units of such Fundamental Change, which shall specify the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii), the date on which such Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be at least 20 nor more than 30 calendar days after the date of such written notice by the Company; , , that if such date would otherwise be less than two calendar days before the first day of the Remarketing Period, the Fundamental Change Early Settlement right must be exercised by such date) (the "Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date"), the applicable Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate and the amount (per Ordinary Share) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder, including the amount of Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments receivable, upon settlement.
provided
however
Normal Units Holders and Stripped Units Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii) in integral multiples of 40 Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be or, if the Fundamental Change Early Settlement occurs after a Special Event Redemption, as the case may be, only in integral multiples of Normal Units such that the Treasury Consideration to be released is in integral multiples of $1,000. Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of Section 5.1 shall apply with respect to a Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.6(b)(ii) ..
In order to exercise the Fundamental Change Early Settlement right with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver, no later than the close of business on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of "Election to Settle Early" on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Stated Amount and (B) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement.
Upon receipt of such Certificate and payment of such funds, the Purchase Contract Agent shall pay the Company from such funds the related Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of the related Purchase Contracts, and notify the Collateral Agent that all the conditions necessary for a Fundamental Change Early Settlement by a Holder of Units have been satisfied pursuant to which the
Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Purchase Price.
Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of the notice from the Purchase Contract Agent set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (1) the Pledged Notes or the Pledged Treasury Consideration in the case of a Holder of Normal Units or (2) Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of a Holder of Stripped Units, in each case with a Value equal to the product of (x) the Stated Amount and (y) the number of Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby.
If a Holder properly effects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.6(b)(ii), the Company shall deliver (or shall cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date:
(A) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Fundamental Change by a Holder of the number of Ordinary Shares issuable on account of each Purchase Contract as if the Stock Purchase Date had occurred immediately prior to such Fundamental Change at the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate in addition to accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments to the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date. For purposes of the foregoing, where a Fundamental Change involves a transaction that causes the Ordinary Shares to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) and the Holder exercises a Fundamental Early Change Settlement, the Company shall deliver to the Holder on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Ordinary Shares that affirmatively make such an election; and
(B) the Notes, the Treasury Consideration or Treasury Securities underlying the Normal Units or the Stripped Units, as the case may be.
The Normal Units or the Stripped Units of the Holders who do not elect Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with this Section 5.6(b)(ii) shall continue to remain outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Stock Purchase Date in accordance with the terms hereof.
          
(c) Successive Adjustments. After an adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates under this Section 5.6, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 5.6 shall cause an adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates as so adjusted.
          
(d) Multiple Adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates pursuant to this Section 5.6 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder.
     
SECTION 5.7 .
Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events
          
(a) Whenever the Fixed Settlement Rates are adjusted as herein provided or the Settlement Rate is fixed pursuant to Section 5.1(f), the Company shall as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires or permits the Settlement Rate to be adjusted or fixed, (i) provide written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of the occurrence of that event and (ii) compute the Fixed Settlement Rates and the Applicable Market Value in accordance with Section 5.6 or, in the case of a fixing of the Settlement Rate, pursuant to Section 5.1(f), and prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Fixed Settlement Rates and the Applicable Market Value or the Fixed Accounting Event Settlement Rate, as the case may be, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based (which Officers' Certificate, in the case of the fixing of the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) shall be delivered by such time and date as specified in Section 5.1(f)) .
          
(b) The Purchase Contract Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Fixed Settlement Rates and the Applicable Market Value, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Ordinary Shares, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract, and the Purchase Contract Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any Ordinary Shares pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
     
SECTION 5.8 . The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of Holders to receive Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments and obligations of Holders to purchase Ordinary Shares, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Normal Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Notes or the Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, forming a part of such Normal Units, and the Stripped Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Treasury Securities forming a part of such Stripped Units, in each case in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 of the Pledge

SECTION 5.9 . (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.9, Purchase Contracts underlying Units having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof may, at the option of the Holder thereof, be settled early ("") on or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. Holders of Stripped Units may only effect Early Settlement of the related Purchase Contracts in integral multiples of 40 Stripped Units, and if Treasury Consideration has been substituted for the Notes as a component in the Normal Units due to the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, Purchase Contracts underlying such Normal Units may only be settled early in integral multiples of Normal Units such that the Treasury Consideration to be deposited and the Treasury Consideration to be released are in integral multiples of $1,000. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing the related Units shall deliver such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment payable to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount (the "") equal to (A) the product of (i) the Purchase Price multiplied by (ii) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts; that no payment shall be required pursuant to clause (B) of this sentence if the Company shall have elected to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments which would otherwise be payable on such Payment Date. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and subject to Section 5.2(d), no payment or adjustment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contract on any Contract Adjustment Payments accrued on such Purchase Contract or on account of any dividends on the Ordinary Shares issued upon such Early Settlement. If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying any Unit at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, such day shall be the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Unit and if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Units shall be the next succeeding Business Day.

This Normal Units Certificate certifies that _______________is the registered Holder of the number of Normal Units set forth above [If the Certificate is a Global Certificate, insert - , as such number may be increased or decreased as set forth on the Schedule of Increases or Decreases in Global Certificate annexed hereto].

Each Normal Unit will have a stated amount of $25 (the "
Stated Amount
"). All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement have the meaning set forth therein.
     
Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the interest in the Note or the Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, constituting part of each Normal Unit evidenced hereby has been pledged to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligations of the Holder under the Purchase Contract comprising a part of such Normal Unit to purchase Ordinary Shares of the Company. Prior to the purchase of Ordinary Shares under each Purchase Contract, such Purchase Contracts shall not entitle the Holders of Normal Units Certificates to any of the rights of a holder of Ordinary Shares, including without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of the meetings of shareholders, or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter or any other rights whatsoever as shareholder of the Company.
     
The Pledge Agreement provides that all payments in respect of the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration received by the Collateral Agent shall be paid by the Collateral Agent by wire transfer in same day funds (i) in the case of (A) any interest payments on Normal Units which include Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, and (B) any payments in respect of the Notes or Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, that have been released from the Pledge pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, to the Purchase Contract Agent to the account designated by the Purchase Contract Agent, no later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day such payment is received by the Collateral Agent (
provided
that in the event such payment is received by the Collateral Agent on a day that is not a Business Day or after 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, then such payment shall be made no later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the next succeeding Business Day) and (ii)
in the case of payments in respect of any Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase Ordinary Shares under the Purchase Contract, to the Company on the Stock Purchase Date (as defined herein) in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, in full satisfaction of the respective obligations of the Holders of the Normal Units of which such Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration are a part under the Purchase Contracts forming a part of such Normal Units. Interest payments payable on each Payment Date (as defined below) with respect to Pledged Notes or the Pledged Treasury Consideration included in the Normal Units shall be made quarterly in arrears on such Payment Date, subject to receipt thereof by the Purchase Contract Agent from the Trustee or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, to the Person in whose name this Normal Units Certificate (or a Predecessor Normal Units Certificate) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date.
     
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on August 15, 2011 (the"
Stock Purchase Date
"), at a price equal to $25 (the "
Purchase Price
"), a number of Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.01 per share ("
Ordinary Shares
"), of the Company, equal to the Settlement Rate or, if the Company has fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Fixed Accounting Event Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement with respect to the Normal Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part, all as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, as defined and more fully described on the reverse hereof. The Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, if not paid earlier, shall be satisfied on the Stock Purchase Date by either (i) the application of payments received with regard to Pledged Treasury Consideration, or (ii) the exercise of the Company's rights as a secured party in connection with the Pledged Notes, as the case may be.
     
The Company shall pay on each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 each year, commencing November 15, 2008 (each a "
Payment Date
") in respect of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Normal Unit evidenced hereby an amount (the "
Contract Adjustment
Payments
") equal to 2.5% per year of the Stated Amount accruing through but excluding the Stock Purchase Date, computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, subject to deferral at the option of the Company as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof (

Payments on the Notes will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Normal Units Register or by wire transfer to the account maintained in the United States designated by written notice given ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date by such Person.
     
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of August 5, 2008 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "
Purchase Contract
Agreement
" ), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "
Purchase Contract Agent
" ), to which Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Normal Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. All defined terms used but not defined in this Certificate have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
     
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $25 (the "
Purchase Price
" ), a number of Ordinary Shares of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate or, if the Company has fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Fixed Accounting Event Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or a Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement with respect to the Unit of which such Purchase Contract is a part. The "
Settlement Rate
" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $18.88 (the ""), 1.3242 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $16.00, the number of Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or less than $16.00, 1.5625 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional Ordinary Shares will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
Threshold Appreciation Price
     
The "
Applicable Market Value
" means the average of the Closing Price per Ordinary Share on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date.
     
The "
Closing Price
" of the Ordinary Shares on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Ordinary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the "
NYSE
") on such date or, if the Ordinary Shares are not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Ordinary Shares are so listed, or if the Ordinary Shares are not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Ordinary Shares in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Ordinary Shares on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company.
     
A "
Trading Day
" means a day on which the Ordinary Shares (A) are not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market
at the close of business and (B) have traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Ordinary Shares at the close of business on such day.
     
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby may be settled prior to the Stock Purchase Date through Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement.
     
In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby (i) by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement; (ii) if the Holder has elected not to participate in the remarketing described in Section 2.19 of the Supplemental Indenture, by application of the cash payment delivered in respect thereof deposited by such Holder in respect of such Purchase Contract in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5.4(b)(iv) of the Purchase Contract Agreement or (iii) if a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the successful remarketing of the Notes as contemplated by Section 5.4 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Consideration purchased by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Ordinary Shares in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares to be purchased thereunder or become entitled to exercise its rights as a secured party in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. If, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Last Failed Remarketing the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, exercises its rights as a secured creditor with respect to the Pledged Notes related to this Normal Units Certificate, any accrued and unpaid interest on such Pledged Notes will become payable by the Company to the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate in the manner provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
     
The Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes, but only to the extent instructed by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon the solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Holders of Normal Units a notice (a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each such Holder on the record date set by the Purchase Contract Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Purchase Contract Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes constituting a part of such Holder's Normal Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of any Holder of Normal Units on such record date, the Purchase Contract Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request the maximum number of Pledged Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Normal Unit, the Purchase Contract Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Note evidenced by such Normal Unit.
     
The Normal Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Normal Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Normal Units Certificate will be registered and Normal Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Normal Units Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange of a Normal Units Certificate, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than exchanges not involving any transfer as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Holder of a Normal Unit may substitute for the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration securing its obligations under the related Purchase Contract Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Unit for which such Pledged Treasury Securities secures the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "
Stripped Unit
." A Holder that elects to substitute Treasury Securities for Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, thereby creating Stripped Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Normal Unit remains in effect, such Normal Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Normal Units in respect of the Pledged Note or Pledged Treasury Consideration and Purchase Contract comprising such Normal Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Normal Unit.
     
A Holder of Stripped Units may reestablish Normal Units at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date by depositing with the Collateral Agent the Notes or the Treasury Consideration in exchange for the release of the Pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.
     
Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Normal Units Certificates) evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered on the Normal Units Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date. The Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in The City of New York or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address appears on the Normal Units Register or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person in writing.
     
The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Purchase Contract Agent written notice of its election to defer each such Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of
10.75% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "
Deferred Contract Adjustment
Payments
"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Stock Purchase Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date.
     
In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date.

In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Stock Purchase Date, the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate will receive on the Stock Purchase Date, a cash payment equal to the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate.
     
In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the date on which the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the Company to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Ordinary Shares other than (i) repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of Ordinary Shares of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its rights to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of any series of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in any series of the Company's Capital Stock (or rights to acquire the Company's Capital Stock); or (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan on the date the Company exercises its right to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights pursuant thereto.

Each Stripped Unit represents (i) a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Treasury Security or, in the case of an Opt-Out, the Cash Consideration, subject to the Pledge of such interest in such Treasury Security or Cash Consideration, as the case may be, by such Holder pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (ii) the rights and obligations of the Holder under one Purchase Contract with XL Capital Ltd, a Cayman Islands exempted limited company (the "

All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement have the meaning set forth therein.
     
Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Treasury Security constituting part of each Stripped Unit evidenced hereby has been pledged to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligations of the Holder under the Purchase Contract comprising a part of such Stripped Unit to purchase Ordinary Shares of the Company. Prior to the purchase of Ordinary Shares under each Purchase Contract, such Purchase Contracts shall not entitle the Holders of Normal Units Certificates to any of the rights of a holder of Ordinary Shares, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of the meetings of shareholders, or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter or any other rights whatsoever as shareholder of the Company.

Stock Purchase
Date
"), at a price equal to $25 (the "
Purchase Price
"), a number of Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.01 per share ("
Ordinary Shares
"), of the Company, equal to the Settlement Rate or, if the Company has fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Fixed Accounting Event Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement with respect to the Stripped Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part, all as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof.

Securities pledged to secure the obligations of the Holder under such Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement.
     
The Company shall pay on each Payment Date in respect of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Stripped Unit evidenced hereby an amount (the "
Contract Adjustment
Payments
") equal to 2.50% per year of the Stated Amount accruing through but excluding the Stock Purchase Date, computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, subject to deferral at the option of the Company as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof (
provided

Such Contract Adjustment Payments shall be payable to the Person in whose name this Stripped Units Certificate (or a Predecessor Stripped Units Certificate) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date.

This is one of the Stripped Units Certificates referred to in the within-mentioned Purchase Contract Agreement.
     
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of August 5, 2008 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "
Purchase Contract
Agreement
"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "
Purchase Contract Agent
"), to which Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Stripped Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. All defined terms used but not defined in this Certificate have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
     
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $25 (the "
Purchase Price
"), a number of Ordinary Shares of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate or, if the Company has fixed the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.1(f) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Fixed Accounting Event Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or a Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement with respect to the Unit of which such Purchase Contract is a part. The "
Settlement Rate
" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $18.88 (the "
Threshold Appreciation Price
"), 1.3242 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $16.00, the number of Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or less than $16.00, 1.5625 Ordinary Shares per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional Ordinary Shares will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
     
The "
Applicable Market Value
" means the average of the Closing Price per Ordinary Share on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date.
     
The "
Closing Price
" of the Ordinary Shares on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Ordinary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the "
NYSE
") on such date or, if the Ordinary Shares are not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Ordinary Shares are so listed, or if the Ordinary Shares are not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Ordinary Shares in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Ordinary Shares on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company.
     
A "
Trading Day
" means a day on which the Ordinary Shares (A) are not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market
at the close of business and (B) have traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Ordinary Shares at the close of business on such day.
     
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby may be settled prior to the Stock Purchase Date through Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement.
     
In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby (i) by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement or (ii) by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying the Stripped Units represented by this Stripped Units Certificate.
     
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Ordinary Shares in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth.
     
The Stripped Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Stripped Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Stripped Units Certificate will be registered and Stripped Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Stripped Units Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange of a Stripped Units Certificate, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than exchanges not involving any transfer as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Holder of a Stripped Unit may substitute for the Pledged Treasury Securities securing its obligations under the related Purchase Contract Notes or the Treasury Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Unit for which such Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration secures the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "
Normal Unit
." A Holder that elects to substitute Notes or the Treasury Consideration for Pledged Treasury Securities, thereby reestablishing Normal Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Stripped Unit remains in effect, such Stripped Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Stripped Unit in respect of the Pledged Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract comprising such Stripped Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Stripped Unit.
     
A Holder of Normal Units may establish Stripped Units at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date by depositing with the Collateral Agent
Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of the Pledged Notes or the Pledged Treasury Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.
     
Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Stripped Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Stripped Units Certificates) evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered on the Stripped Units Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, or, if the Units do not remain in book-entry only form, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address appears on the Stripped Units Register or by wire transfer to the account maintained in the United States designated by written notice given ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date by such Person.
     
The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Purchase Contract Agent written notice of its election to defer each such Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 10.75% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "
Deferred Contract Adjustment
Payments
"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Stock Purchase Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date.
     
In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date.
     
In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Stock Purchase Date, the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate will receive on the Stock Purchase Date, a cash payment equal to the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate.
     
The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments) will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Senior Indebtedness in the manner and to the extent set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
     
In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the date on which the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the Company to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Ordinary Shares other than (i) repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of Ordinary Shares of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its rights to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of any series of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in any series of the Company's Capital Stock (or rights to acquire the Company's Capital Stock); or (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan on the date the Company exercises its right to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights pursuant thereto.
     
The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive accumulated Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, and the obligations of the Holders to purchase Ordinary Shares, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Stripped Units Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Treasury Securities from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement.
     
Upon registration of transfer of this Stripped Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Stripped Units Certificate and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.

provided
that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Stripped Units may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities, to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase Ordinary Shares under the Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. The obligations of each Holder to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and except to the extent paid by Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such payments and the Purchase Price.
     
Each Holder of any Unit, and each Beneficial Owner thereof, by its acceptance thereof or of its interest therein, further agrees to treat (i) the formation of Stripped Units as the acquisition of a Unit consisting of the Purchase Contract and the Treasury Securities and (ii) itself as the owner of the related Notes, Treasury Consideration or Treasury Securities, as the case may be.
     
Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding Purchase Contracts.
     
The Purchase Contracts shall for all purposes be governed by and deemed to be a contract under, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

The grant of such power-of-attorney shall not be deemed to require of the Collateral Agent any specific duties or obligations not otherwise assumed by the Collateral Agent hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary or the Purchase Contract Agent be responsible for the preparation or filing of any financing or continuation statements in the appropriate jurisdictions or responsible for maintenance or perfection of any security interest hereunder.

The Collateral Agent shall, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date, without any instruction from Holders of Normal Units, deliver (i) the Pledged Notes to be remarketed to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing and (ii) the remaining Pledged Notes to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to the Holders that have elected not to participate in the remarketing in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon completion of a successful remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will deliver the proceeds of such
remarketing to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company to be held in Trust for the Company. Upon receipt of the proceeds following a successful remarketing, (i) the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, shall thereupon apply such proceeds in an amount equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the related Normal Units in direct settlement and satisfaction in full of such Normal Units Holders' obligations to pay to the Company the Purchase Price under the Purchase Contracts on the Stock Purchase Date and (ii) the remaining portion, if any, of the proceeds of such successful remarketing shall be distributed by the Remarketing Agent to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment on a pro rata basis to such Normal Units Holders participating in such remarketing.
          
(b)

If by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date the Remarketing Agent has failed to remarket the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes participating in the remar-keting, the "Last Failed Remarketing" shall be deemed to have occurred. In this case, the Re-marketing Agent will agree to advise the Collateral Agent in writing that it cannot remarket the related Pledged Notes of such Holders of Normal Units and the Remarketing Agent will agree pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement to return to the Collateral Agent the Notes delivered to it pursuant to Section 4.5(a) within three Business Days of the Last Failed Remarketing. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company will, at the written direction of the Company, deliver or dispose of the Pledged Notes in accordance with the Company's written instructions to satisfy in full, from any such disposition or retention, such Holders' obligations to pay the Purchase Price for the Ordinary Shares; provided that if upon the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent delivers or disposes of the Pledged Notes in accordance with the written instructions of the Company, any accumulated and unpaid interest on such Notes will become payable by the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holder of the Normal Units to which such Notes relate in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement.
          
(c)
In the event a Holder of Stripped Units has not made an Early Settlement, Fundamental Change Early Settlement or Cash Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying its Stripped Units, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the Ordinary Shares to be issued under such Purchase Contracts from the payments received in respect of the related Pledged Treasury Securities. Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder of Stripped Units, the Collateral Agent shall apply such payments to the Company in settlement of such Purchase Contracts on the Stock Purchase Date pursuant to written instructions from the Purchase Contract Agent. In the event the payments received in respect of the related Pledged Treasury Securities are in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchase Contracts being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent shall distribute such excess, when received, to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to such Holders of Stripped Units.

On the second Business Day immediately prior to the Remar-keting Date, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remar-keting Agent of the aggregate principal amount of such Separate Notes to be remarketed. The Custodial Agent will hold such Separate Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account. A holder of Separate Notes electing to have its Separate Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw such election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, on or prior to the thirteenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent will return such Separate Notes to such holder. On the Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent at the written direction of the Remarketing Agent will deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all Separate Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to this Section 4.5(d) and not withdrawn pursuant to the terms hereof prior to such date.

If, despite using reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent advises the Custodial Agent in writing that there has been a Last Failed Remarketing, the Remar-keting Agent will promptly return such Notes to the Custodial Agent for redelivery to the holders of such Separate Notes. For purposes of this Section 4.5(d), a "holder" of Separate Notes shall mean the Person in whose name such Separate Notes are registered on the books of the registrar for the Notes.

Wherever reference is made in this Agreement to any section of the Code, such reference shall be deemed to include a reference to any provision of the Code which is a successor to, or amendment of, such section.

Purchase Contract Agent shall have no liability to any Holder for executing any documents or taking any such acts requested by the Company or the Collateral Agent (acting upon the written request of the Company) hereunder, except for liability for its own grossly negligent act, its own grossly negligent failure to act, its own bad faith or its own willful misconduct.

Thereafter, the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as it had in respect of the Pledged Notes as provided in Articles II, III, IV, V and VI, and any reference herein to the Notes shall be deemed to be reference to such Treasury Portfolio, and any reference herein to interest on the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Treasury Portfolio.

Thereupon, the Collateral Agent shall deliver the related Pledged Notes to the Purchase Contract Agent on the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Remarketing Period, free and clear of any lien, claim and security interest created hereby. Thereafter, such Units will be Stripped Units and the Collateral Agent shall have a first priority perfected security interest in such Cash Consideration paid by such Holder.

Section 8.6
Compensation and Indemnity
. The Company agrees:
     
(a)
to pay each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary from time to time such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, for all services rendered by each of them hereunder; and
     
(b)
to indemnify the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and their officers, directors and agents for, and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any loss, liability, claim, damage or reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its powers and duties under this Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel) of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of such powers and duties or collecting such amounts. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary upon actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer thereof shall each promptly notify the Company of any third party claim which may give rise to the indemnity hereunder and give the Company the opportunity to control the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, provided no conflict of interest exists (if such a conflict of interests exists, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary will be entitled to one separate counsel at any one time payable by the Company), and if the Company so elects to assume such defense, the Company shall in good faith defend the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary (in which case all attorney's fees and expenses shall be borne by the Company). No compromise or settlement of any claims may be effected by any party without the other parties' consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless (i) there is no finding or omission of any violation of law and no effect on any other claims that may be made against any of such other parties and (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the party seeking the compromise or settlement. The provisions of this Section 8.6(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary.
          
Section 8.7

The Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may, but shall not be required, in addition elect to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or orders at the expense of the Company as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may deem necessary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent nor the Securities Intermediary shall be required to take any action that is in the reasonable opinion of its counsel contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, or which would in its reasonable opinion subject it or any of its officers, employees or directors to liability.

The Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence. Upon notice of any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after any notice of such resignation or such removal, then the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may at the Company's expense petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. Upon removal of the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, no fees paid to the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary pursuant to Section 8.6(a) of this Agreement shall be refunded. Each successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be a bank which has an office or agency in New York, New York with a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or any affiliate of a bank holding company having such capital and surplus. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, such successor shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, upon payment of any of its unpaid fees and expenses, shall take all appropriate action to transfer any money and property held by it hereunder (including the Collateral) to such successor. The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Section 8.8, and Section 8.6 hereof, shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent hereunder shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary hereunder.
          
So long as it meets the requirements of this Section 8.8, any corporation into which the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, in its individual capacity, may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Collateral Agent in its indi-
vidual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Collateral Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, respectively, under this Agreement without further act.

Dear Sirs
XL Capital Ltd. Form S-3 Registration Statement
We have acted as Cayman Islands counsel to the Company, a Cayman Islands exempted limited company, and are giving this opinion to you in connection with the Registration Statement ("Registration Statement") on Form S-3 (File No. 333 130036) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 1 December 2005, which became effective 1December 2005 ("Effective Date"), covering the issuance and sale by the Company to the underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement defined below (collectively, the "Underwriters") of (i) 143,750,000 of the Company's Class A Ordinary Shares, par value of US$0.01 per share ("Ordinary Shares") (such 143,750,000 Ordinary Shares, the "Shares") and (ii) 23,000,000 of the Company's 10.75% Equity Security Units (the "Units" and together with the Shares the "Securities"). Each Unit has a stated amount of $25 and initially consists of (a) a contract (the "Purchase Contracts") pursuant to which the holder agrees to purchase, for $25, Class A Ordinary Shares of the Company on August 15, 2011 (the "Issuable Ordinary Shares") and (b) a 1/40, or 2.5%, ownership interest in a 8.25% senior note (the "Senior Notes") issued by the Company due August 15, 2021 with a principal amount of $1,000. In connection with the issuance of the Units, the Company entered into the following agreements: (1) Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the
 
 
 
 
"Supplemental Indenture"), dated August 5, 2008, to the Indenture, dated as of June 2, 2004, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"), which governs the terms of the Senior Notes, (2) Purchase Contract Agreement (the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), dated August 5, 2008, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Purchase Contract Agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent"), which governs the terms of the Purchase Contracts and (3) Pledge Agreement (the "Pledge Agreement"), dated August 5, 2008, by and among the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Purchase Contract Agent, which governs the terms of the pledge of the Senior Notes to secure the holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts.
Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein have the respective meanings given to them in the Registration Statement.
The prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the Effective Date is hereinafter referred to as the "Base Prospectus". The Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Units and the Ordinary Shares in the form dated 29 July 2008 first filed on 31 July 2008 with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 (b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is hereinafter referred to together as the "Prospectus".
We have examined the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Senior Notes and the Pledge Agreement are hereinafter sometimes together referred to as the "Documents" and singly, a "Document".
In giving this opinion, we have relied, upon the accuracy of a certificate of the secretary of the Company dated 5 August 2008 ("Secretary's Certificate") without further verification and have assumed the continuing accuracy of the Secretary's Certificate as at the date of this opinion. We have assumed without independent verification:
 
 
 
 
 
State of New York (by which they are expressly governed) and all other relevant laws (other than the laws of the Cayman Islands) and the choice of the laws of the State of New York as the governing law of the Documents is valid and binding under the laws the State of New York and all other relevant laws (other than the laws of the Cayman Islands);
 
 
 
 
 
and that there is no matter affecting the authority of the directors to effect entry by the Company into the Documents, not disclosed by the Memorandum and Articles of Association or the Resolutions, which would have any adverse implication in relation to the opinions expressed herein.
On the basis of the foregoing and subject to the qualifications below, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
The opinions expressed above concerning, in particular, the issue of the Company Securities and the enforceability of the Documents are, to the extent that Cayman Islands law might apply, subject to the following qualifications:
 
 
 
 
 
costs (as determined by taxation as aforesaid) of the successful party will normally be recoverable, subject to the limits laid down in guidelines made under such Rules as to the type and amount of fees and expenses that may be recovered. Such orders are in the discretion of the court and may be made to reflect particular circumstances of the case and the conduct of the parties.
Ad valorem stamp duty is payable within 45 days of execution or, if executed outside of the Cayman Islands, within 45 days of an executed, completed and delivered original of such document being brought into the Cayman Islands, for example, for enforcement. Otherwise stamp duty is payable on execution in order to avoid penalties if such document is to be admitted in evidence in a Cayman Islands court.
 
 
 
 
 
the Company in its Memorandum of Association and pursuant to the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands are unrestricted and the transactions contemplated are therefore strictly speaking within the powers of the Company. It is possible that a Cayman Islands court would determine that a transaction which was of no commercial benefit to the Company was an abuse of the powers of the Directors of the Company and therefore voidable by the shareholders or a liquidator of the Company.
We are practising in the Cayman Islands and we do not purport to be experts on the laws of any other jurisdiction and we have made no investigation of, or express any opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands. This opinion is based upon the laws of the Cayman Islands in effect at the date hereof and is given only as to the circumstances existing on the date hereof and known to us.
This opinion is intended solely for your benefit and that of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP as your legal advisors. You may give copies of this opinion to your legal advisors who may rely on it as though it were also addressed to them. It may not be relied upon by any other person although we hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the headings "Legal Matters" and "Enforcement of Civil Liabilities Under United States Federal Securities Laws". Our consent to such reference does not constitute a consent under Section 7 of the Act as, in consenting to such reference, we have not certified any part of the Registration Statement and do not otherwise come within the categories of persons whose consent is required under such Section 7 or under the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
Yours
