HAMILTON, BERMUDA, January 23, 2009 -- XL Capital Ltd (XL or the Company) (NYSE: XL) announced today that the Company has entered into a Remarketing Agreement relating to the remarketing of the 5.25% Senior Notes due 2011 (the "Senior Notes") comprising part of its 7.00% Equity Security Units.  The Company has retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. to act as the agent (the Remarketing Agent) for the remarketing.
 
The remarketing will commence on February 3, 2009 and will settle on February 17, 2009, when the forward purchase contracts comprising part of the Equity Security Units are to be settled.  Subject to certain conditions, the proceeds from the remarketing will be used to satisfy the purchase price for the Company's Ordinary Shares to be sold to holders of the Equity Security Units pursuant to the forward purchase contracts.  The number of Ordinary Shares to be issued on February 17, 2009 will be determined based on their average trading price for a period preceding that date and is subject to a maximum of approximately 11.5 million shares under the purchase contracts.
 
The Company may, at its discretion, submit an order to purchase some or all of the Senior Notes available to be remarketed.  In the event that the Company determines to participate in the remarketing, the Company will retire all the Senior Notes it purchases in the remarketing.
 
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Senior Notes or any other securities, nor will there be any sale of the Senior Notes in the remarketing
 
 
 
 
in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
