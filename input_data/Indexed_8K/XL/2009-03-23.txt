Item 8.01 Other Events.
XL announced today that it has concluded most aspects of its strategic review of its life reinsurance operations announced in July 2008. XL successfully concluded a renewal rights transaction relating to its Continental European Life, Accident and Health business in December 2008. Given current market conditions, XL has determined to put its U.K. and Irish life businesses into run-off. XL continues to explore options with respect to its U.S. life reinsurance operations. This is part of XL's previously announced strategy of focusing on its property and casualty businesses.
