Item 8.01 Other Events.
XL Capital Ltd ("XL") has announced that an agreement, dated as of November 12, 2009, was entered into for the sale of XLs stake in the Ita-XL joint venture insurance company to Ita Seguros S.A. ("Ita Seg"), and for termination of the joint venture (the "Transaction"). The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2010, subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals. To maintain continuity for XL's insurance segment's local clients in Brazil as well as Global Program clients with operations in Brazil, a separate arrangement has been entered into by which Ita Seg will provide insurance coverage in Brazil to these clients, after completion of the Transaction. These insurance policies will be reinsured with an XL-owned Brazilian reinsurance company as such coverage was reinsured prior to termination of the joint venture. XL remains present in the Brazilian market with a reinsurance operation and with its Servicing Hub for Large and M ultinational Insurance Clients with operations in Latin America and the Caribbean and is committed to continue to support its clients in the emerging markets of Latin America.
