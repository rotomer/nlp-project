Defined as net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, goodwill impairment charges and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for the Company's insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, the gains recognized on the repurchase of the Company's Series C preference ordinary shares, and the gain recorded relating to the Company's sale of a portion of an investment in an affiliate, as well as foreign exchange gains or losses, net of tax. Operating net income and full year return on ordinary shareholders' equity based on operating net income are "non-GAAP financial measures." During the year, the Company amended its definition of operating net income to exclude after-tax foreign exchange gains and losses. The results from prior periods have been represented to conform to the current quarter's presentation. See the schedule entitled "Reconciliation" at the end of this release for a reconciliation of "operating net income" to net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders and of annualized and full year return on ordinary shareholders' equity based on operating net income.

Book value per share and fully diluted book value per ordinary share are non-GAAP financial measures and represent book value per ordinary share (total shareholders' equity less preference shareholders' equity and non-controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries, divided by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end) combined with the dilutive impact of potential future share issues at any period end. The Company believes that fully diluted book value per ordinary share is a financial measure important to investors and other interested parties who benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry. However, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry.

HAMILTON, BERMUDA  February 8, 2011  XL Group plc ("XL" or the "Company") (NYSE: XL) today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2010 results.
Commenting on the Company's performance, Chief Executive Officer Mike McGavick said:
"XL's fourth quarter results demonstrated progress in several key elements driving shareholder value. Our P&C operations' 91.4% combined ratio benefited from outstanding performance from our Reinsurance segment, positive prior year development and sustained operating efficiency. We received our license to offer insurance in China and added experienced teams in lines we believe offer prospects for strategic growth. Our on-going risk management discipline resulted in our catastrophe losses being at the low end of the expected range, with only modest changes to our initial estimates for the New Zealand earthquake. We reduced exposures to non-core holdings, and we continued to return excess capital through share buybacks. We believe XL is in a solid position to meet the challenges of current market conditions and the opportunities that will come as conditions improve."
The Company also announced that fourth quarter natural catastrophe losses include $23.3 million related to flooding in Australia.  Based on preliminary data available, the Companys first quarter losses related to flooding in Australia are expected to range between an additional $75.0 million and $95.0 million.  The Companys estimates are based on its review of individual treaties and policies expected to be impacted and client data received to date. The Companys loss estimates involve the exercise of considerable judgment and are accordingly subject to revision.
Highlights - Three and twelve months ended December 31
(US Dollars in thousands except per share amounts)

Note 1: Certain items have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.
Note 2: Book value per share and fully diluted book value per ordinary share are non-GAAP financial measures and represent book value per ordinary share (total shareholders' equity less preference shareholders' equity and non-controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries, divided by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end) combined with the dilutive impact of potential future share issues at any period end. The Company believes that fully diluted book value per ordinary share is a financial measure important to investors and other interested parties who benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry. However, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry.

The following is a reconciliation of the Company's net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders to operating net income (loss) (Note 1) and annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity based on operating net income (loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
Note 1: Defined as net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, goodwill impairment charges, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for the Company's insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, the gains recognized on the repurchase of the Company's Series C preference ordinary shares, and the gain recorded relating to the Company's sale of a portion of an investment in an affiliate, as well as foreign exchange gains or losses, net of tax. Operating net income and annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity based on operating net income are "non-GAAP financial measures." During the year, the Company amended its definition of operating net income to exclude after-tax foreign exchange gains and losses. The results from prior periods have been represented to conform to the current period's presentation.
Note 2: Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is used to calculate per share data except where it is anti-dilutive to earnings per share or where there is a net loss. When it is anti-dilutive or when a net loss occurs, basic weighted average ordinary shares outstanding are utilized in the calculation of net loss per share and net operating loss per share.
Note 3: Ordinary shareholders' equity is defined as total shareholders' equity less preference ordinary shares and less non-controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries.
Note 4: Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.

XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance. This press release contains the presentation of (i) operating net income (loss), which is defined as net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, goodwill impairment charges and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for the Company's insurance company affiliates for the periods presented including the gain recorded relating to the Company's sale of a portion of an investment in an affiliate, the gains recognized on the repurchase of the Company's Series C preference ordinary shares, as well as foreign exchange gains or losses, net of tax (ii) annualized and full year return on ordinary shareholders' equity based on operating net income (loss) and (iii) book value per ordinary share (ordinary shareholders' equity divided by number of shares outstanding at the period end date) and fully diluted book value per ordinary share
(book value per share adjusted for the impact of share based compensation and certain conversion features where dilutive). These items are "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included in this release.
Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XL's operations and the Company's insurance company operating affiliates, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value and from goodwill impairment charges without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XL's financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains and the recognition of goodwill impairment charges are largely a function of economic and interest rate conditions.
Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than weather and energy and credit derivatives. With respect to credit derivatives, because XL and its insurance company operating affiliates generally hold financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies' treatment of such contracts) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance. Unlike these credit derivatives, XL's weather and energy derivatives are actively traded (i.e., they are not held to maturity) and are, therefore, not excluded from net income as any gains or losses from this business are considered by management when evaluating and managing the underlying business.
The gains recognized on the repurchase of the Company's Series C preference ordinary shares, are excluded as these transactions were capital in nature and outside the scope of the Company's underlying business.
Foreign exchange gains and losses in the income statement are only one element of the overall impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Company's financial position and are not representative of any economic gain or loss made by the Company. Accordingly, it is not a relevant indicator of financial performance and it is excluded.
In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing operating net income (loss) enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.
Return on average ordinary shareholders' equity ("ROE") excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, goodwill impairment charges and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for the Company's insurance company operating affiliates for the periods presented including the gain recorded relating to the Company's sale of a portion of an investment in an affiliate, the gains recognized on the repurchase of the Company's Series C preference ordinary shares, as well as foreign exchange gains or losses, net of tax (the "Exclusions"), is a widely used measure of any company's profitability. Annualized return on average ordinary shareholders' equity (minus the Exclusions) is calculated by dividing annualized net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders minus the Exclusions for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders' equity. The Company establishes target ROEs (minus the Exclusions) for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Company's ROE (minus the Exclusions) return targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines.
