The Credit Agreement provides for issuance of letters of credit up to $1,000,000,000, with the option to increase the size of the facility by an additional $500,000,000. Concurrent with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, the commitments of the lenders under the existing five-year credit agreement dated June 21, 2007 by and between XLG, XLA, XLIB and XL Re, as account parties, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto (the "Five-Year Agreement") was reduced by $1,000,000,000.

The obligations of each of the Account Parties are secured by a perfected security interest in cash and certain designated securities that are pledged to the Collateral Agent by each Account Party pursuant to Pledge Agreement (the "Pledge Agreement") and a collateral account control agreement. Each of the Company, XLG, XLA, XLIB, XLRe and XLL guarantees the obligations of the other Account Parties under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth and a maximum ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth, and that require each of XLIB, XLRe and XLRe Europe to maintain a financial strength rating of no less than "A-" from A.M. Best & Co. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type as well as certain customary events of default.
Concurrent with the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement, the Five-Year Agreement was amended (the "Five-Year Agreement Amendment") to (i) permit the security interest as set forth in the Credit Agreement and (ii) permit the Company to be an Account Party and guarantor under the Credit Agreement.
The foregoing descriptions of the Credit Agreement, the Five-Year Agreement Amendment and the Pledge Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, the Five-Year Agreement Amendment and the Pledge Agreement, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

To request the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Participated Letter of Credit), an Account Party shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Lender) to the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit, or identifying the Participated Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Participated Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (d) of this Section), the amount of such Participated Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Participated Letter of Credit. If Participated Letters of Credit issued in connection with the same request shall provide for the automatic extension of the expiry date thereof unless the Issuing Lender thereof or the Administrative Agent gives notice that such expiry date shall not be extended, then the Administrative Agent (acting on behalf of the relevant Issuing Lender) will give such notice for all such Participated Letters of Credit if requested to do so by the Issuing Lender in a notice given to the Administrative Agent not more than 60 days, but not less than 45 days, prior to the current expiry date of such Participated Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Lender, such Account Party also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Lender's standard form in connection with any request for a Participated Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Account Party to, or entered into by such Account Party with, the Issuing Lender relating to a Participated Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

                    (c) . A Participated Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Participated Letter of Credit XL Group shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the Aggregate LC Exposure of the Lenders shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments and (ii) the LC Exposure of the Issuing Lender (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed the Commitment of such Issuing Lender.
Limitations on Amounts
                    (d) .

By the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Participated Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by the Issuing Lender, and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or the Lenders, the Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing
Participations
Lender, a participation in such Participated Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Participated Letter of Credit. The obligation of each Lender under a Participated Letter of Credit shall be several and not joint. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Participated Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Participated Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the Issuing Lender, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Lender in respect of any Participated Letter of Credit promptly upon the request of the Issuing Lender at any time from the time such LC Disbursement is made until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Specified Account Party or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Specified Account Party for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Specified Account Party pursuant to the next following paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Lender or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement shall not relieve the Specified Account Party of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
                    (f) . If any Lender shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of any Participated Letter of Credit, the Specified Account Party with respect thereto agrees to reimburse such Lender in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Account Parties receive notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Account Parties receive such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time.
Reimbursement

The several obligations of the Specified Account Party with respect to any Letter of Credit to reimburse LC Disbursements in respect of any Participated Letter of Credit as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Participated Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Participated Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or

provided
                    Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Lender, nor any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the payment or failure to make any payment under a Participated Letter of Credit (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence) as a result of determining whether drafts or other documents presented under a Participated Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof, or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Participated Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Lender from liability to the Account Parties to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Account Parties to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Account Parties that are caused by the Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Participated Letter of Credit comply with the terms hereof.

The Issuing Lender shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Specified Account Party with respect to such Letter of Credit by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or email) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Specified Account Party of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
provided
                    (i) . If any LC Disbursement is made with respect to a Participated Letter of Credit, then, unless such LC Disbursement is reimbursed in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, subject to Section 2.09(a), for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such LC Disbursement is reimbursed, at the rate per annum equal to 1% the Alternate Base Rate. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of the Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Lender shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

                    (g) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund from the relevant Governmental Authority of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by an Account Party or with respect to which an Account Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay over such refund to such Account Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Account Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that such Account Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Account Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental

                    SECTION 2.12.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
                    (a) Each Account Party shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of fees, reimbursement of LC Disbursements or interest thereon, under Section 2.10 or 2.11, or otherwise) or under any other Credit Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim; that any payments in respect of Alternative Currency Letters of Credit shall be made in the manner (including the time and place of payment) as shall have been separately agreed between the relevant Account Party and Lender pursuant to Section 2.06. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 1111 Fannin Street, Houston, Texas except payments pursuant to Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 10.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
Payments by the Account Parties.
provided
                    (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
Application of Insufficient Payments.
                    (c) Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: each reimbursement of LC Disbursements (other than in respect of Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) shall be made to the relevant Lenders, each payment of fees under Section 2.08 shall be made for account of the relevant Lenders, each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.07 and any interest paid in respect of any Reimbursement Obligation shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, in each case pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (or, in the case of any such reimbursement or payment after the termination of the Commitments, pro rata according to the Aggregate LC Exposure).
Pro Rata Treatment.
                    (d) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any of its LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) or accrued interest thereon resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other relevant Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) of such other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of their respective LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) and accrued interest thereon; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Account Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Account Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Account Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law and to the extent that it is a Specified Account Party, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Account Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Account Party in the amount of such participation.
Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
provided
                    (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from an Account Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the relevant Lenders hereunder that such Account Party will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Account Party has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the relevant Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Account Party has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment.
                    (f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to this Agreement, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent.
                    SECTION 2.13. .
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
                    (a) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10, or if any Account Party is required to pay any additional amount or indemnification payment to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.11, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. XL Group hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Nothing in this Section 2.13(a) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Account Parties or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Sections 2.10 or 2.11.
Designation of a Different Lending Office
                    (b) . If any Lender (i) requests compensation under Section 2.10, or if any Account Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11, (ii) becomes a Defaulting Lender, (iii) has refused to consent to any waiver or amendment with respect to any Credit Document that requires the consent of all the Lenders or of such Lender as a Lender directly and adversely affected by such waiver or amendment and has been consented to by the Required Lenders or (iv) if any Lender ceases to be a NAIC Approved Bank, then XL Group may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee selected by XL Group that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) XL Group shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to its outstanding LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding LC Disbursements and accrued interest and fees) or the relevant Account Party (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.10 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.11, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the relevant Account Party to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
Replacement of Lenders
provided
                    (c) The Account Parties shall not be responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by any Lender that arranges for its obligations under the Letters of Credit to be confirmed by a NAIC Approved Bank or by such confirming bank.

provided
                    (c) if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing then:
                    (d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Obligors in accordance with clause (c) above, and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (c)(i) above (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
                    In the event that the Administrative Agent, XL Group and each Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment.

EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
          (p) The obligations of each Pledgor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be impaired by any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of, any right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Credit Document.
          (q) Any Person that is required to execute a counterpart of this Agreement after the date hereof pursuant to the requirements of the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document shall become a Pledgor hereunder by (x) executing a counterpart hereof and delivering same to the Collateral Agent, or by executing an assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the Administrative Agent), (y) delivering supplements to Schedule I and II as are necessary to cause such schedules to be complete and accurate with respect to such additional Pledgor on such date and complying with Section 10.14 of the Credit Agreement and (z) taking all actions as specified in this Agreement as would have been taken by such Pledgor had it been an original party to this Agreement, in each case with all documents required above to be delivered to the Collateral Agent and with all documents and actions required above to be taken to the reasonable satisfaction of the Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the Administrative Agent).
          (r) By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Pledgor acknowledges that it has by a separate written instrument, designated and appointed CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, 13th floor, New York, New York 10011 (or any successor entity thereto), as its authorized agent upon which process may be served in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement that may be instituted in any federal or state court in the State of New York. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

          (t) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto agrees that the Administrative Agent may provide multiple directions and/or instructions to the Collateral Agent in a single writing; that no such instructions or directions shall relate to contingent events in the future.
