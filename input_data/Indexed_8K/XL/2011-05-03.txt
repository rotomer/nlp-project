Exhibit 99.1
1
Defined as net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for the Company's insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, the gains recognized on the repurchase of the Company's preference ordinary shares, as well as foreign exchange gains or losses, net of tax. "Operating net income" and "annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity" based on operating net income are "non-GAAP financial measures." The results from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. See the schedule entitled "Reconciliation" at the end of this release for a reconciliation of "operating net income" to net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders and of "annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity" based on operating net income to average ordinary shareholders' equity.

Book value per share and fully diluted book value per ordinary share are non-GAAP financial measures and represent book value per ordinary share (total shareholders' equity less preference shareholders' equity and non-controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries, divided by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end) combined with the dilutive impact of potential future share issues at any period end. The Company believes that fully diluted book value per ordinary share is a financial measure important to investors and other interested parties who benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry. However, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry.

HAMILTON, BERMUDA  May 3, 2011  XL Group plc ("XL" or the "Company") (NYSE: XL) today reported its first quarter 2011 results.
Commenting on the Company's performance, Chief Executive Officer Mike McGavick said:
"XL's first quarter results demonstrate resilience in the face of global catastrophic events. We are proud of the roles our insurance and reinsurance solutions are playing in the recovery of the devastated economies. Our risk management discipline again resulted in estimated losses from the quarter's three major catastrophes that are well within our expected levels. As markets respond to these events and others, we believe our underwriting excellence, operating efficiency and capital strength put XL in an exceptional position to pursue the opportunities provided by improving market conditions."

Note 1: During the current quarter, the Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares were reclassified as Non-controlling interest  Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares and Series E preference ordinary shares were reclassified as Non-controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a result of changes in ownership structure arising as part of the Company's redomestication of the ultimate parent holding company to Ireland as of July 1, 2010. Accordingly, preference share dividends declared are recorded as Non-controlling interest in net (income) loss of subsidiary rather than as Preference share dividends within the consolidated statements of income from July 1, 2010 onwards.

Note 1: Certain items have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Note 2: Book value per share and fully diluted book value per ordinary share are non-GAAP financial measures and represent book value per ordinary share (total shareholders' equity less preference shareholders' equity and non-controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries, divided by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end) combined with the dilutive impact of potential future share issues at any period end.

The following is a reconciliation of the Company's (i) net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders to operating net income (loss) (Note 1) and (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity (based on operating net income (loss)) to average ordinary shareholders' equity for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.
Note 1: Defined as net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for the Company's insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, the gains recognized on the repurchase of the Company's preference ordinary shares, as well as foreign exchange gains or losses, net of tax. Operating net income and annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity based on operating net income are " non-GAAP financial measures." The results from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period's press release. Note 2: Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is used to calculate per share data except where it is anti-dilutive to earnings per share or where there is a net loss. When it is anti-dilutive or when a net loss occurs, basic weighted average ordinary shares outstanding is utilized in the calculation of net loss per share and net operating loss per share.
Note 3: Ordinary shareholders' equity is defined as total shareholders' equity less preference ordinary shares and less non-controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries.
Note 4: Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

XL presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance. This press release contains the presentation of (i) operating net income (loss) ("Operating Net Income"), which is defined as net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on credit, structured financial and investment derivatives, net of tax, for the Company and its share of these items for the Company's insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, the gains recognized on the repurchase of the Company's preference ordinary shares, as well as foreign exchange gains or losses, net of tax (ii) annualized return on ordinary shareholders' equity ("ROE") based on operating net income (loss) ("Operating ROE") and (iii) book value per ordinary share (ordinary shareholders' equity divided by the number of shares outstanding at the period end date) and fully diluted book value per ordinary share (book value per share adjusted for the impact of share based compensation and certain conversion features where dilutive). These items are "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included in this press release.
Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XL's operations and the Company's insurance company operating affiliates, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XL's financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the recurring sources of income without the effects of this variable. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely a function of economic and interest rate conditions.
Investment derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than credit derivatives. With respect to credit derivatives, because XL and its insurance company operating affiliates generally hold financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies' treatment of such contracts) as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance.
The gains recognized on the repurchase of the Company's preference ordinary shares, are excluded as these transactions were capital in nature and outside the scope of the Company's underlying business.
Foreign exchange gains and losses in the income statement are only one element of the overall impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Company's financial position and are not representative of any economic gain or loss made by the Company. Accordingly, it is not a relevant indicator of financial performance and it is excluded.
In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing operating net income (loss) enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it much more difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.
Operating ROE is a widely used measure of any company's profitability that is calculated by dividing annualized Operating Net Income for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders' equity. The Company establishes target Operating ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Company's Operating ROE targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, the Company seeks to re-evaluate these lines.
