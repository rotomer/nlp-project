XL GROUP PLC ANNOUNCES REMARKETING PLANS FOR 8.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2021
HAMILTON, BERMUDA, July 22, 2011  XL Group plc (XL or the Company) (NYSE: XL) announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, XL Company Switzerland GmbH (XL-Switzerland), has entered into a Remarketing Agreement relating to the remarketing of XL Group Ltd.s $575 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior notes due August 2021 (the 8.25% Notes) comprising a part of the Equity Security Units issued in 2008 (the ESUs). Goldman, Sachs & Co. will act as the agent for the remarketing.
XL Group Ltd. currently anticipates that it will participate in the remarketing and submit an order to purchase some or all of the 8.25% Notes available to be remarketed, and will retire all such 8.25% Notes it may purchase in the remarketing.
The remarketing will commence on August 2, 2011 and is anticipated to settle on August 15, 2011, when the forward purchase contracts comprising part of the ESUs are to be settled. Subject to certain conditions, the proceeds from the remarketing of the 8.25% Notes will be used to satisfy the purchase price for XLs ordinary shares to be issued and delivered to holders of the ESUs upon settlement of the forward purchase contracts. The number of ordinary shares to be issued upon settlement of the forward purchase contracts will be determined based on the average trading price for the ordinary shares over a period preceding that date and is subject to a maximum of approximately 35.9 million shares.
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the 8.25% Notes or any other securities, nor will there be any sale of the 8.25% Notes in the remarketing in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
