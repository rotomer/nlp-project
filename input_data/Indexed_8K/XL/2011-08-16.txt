XL-Cayman will retire all of the Senior Notes that it purchased in the remarketing. The proceeds from the remarketing were used to satisfy the purchase price for XLs ordinary shares issued to holders of the ESUs pursuant to the forward purchase contract comprising a part of the ESUs. Each forward purchase contract provided for the issuance of 1.3242 ordinary shares of XL at a price of $25.00. The settlement of the forward purchase contracts resulted in XLs issuance of an aggregate of 30,456,600 ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $575 million.
 
As a result of the settlement of the forward purchase contracts, the ESUs (formerly NYSE: XLPRY) ceased to exist and are no longer traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
