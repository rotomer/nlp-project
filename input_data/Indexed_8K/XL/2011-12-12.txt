Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 9, 2011, XL Group plc, an Irish public limited company (the "Company"), together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries that are named below (together with the Company, the "Account Parties"), entered into (a) a new secured credit agreement (the "New Secured Credit Agreement") and (b) a new unsecured credit agreement (the "New Unsecured Credit Agreement" and together with the New Secured Credit Agreement, the "New Credit Agreements").
In connection with the New Credit Agreements, the Company's existing credit agreement dated as of June 21, 2007 (the "2007 Credit Agreement") was terminated. The Company's existing secured credit agreement dated as of March 25, 2011 (the "March 2011 Credit Agreement") continues in force, but was amended (the "Amendment") to conform certain of its terms to those of the New Secured Credit Agreement.
The 2007 Credit Agreement had provided for letters of credit and for revolving credit loans of up to $750,000,000 with the aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit and revolving credit loans thereunder not to exceed $3,000,000,000. At the time at which it was terminated and the New Credit Agreements became effective, there were no outstanding revolving credit loans under the 2007 Credit Agreement. A portion of the letters of credit outstanding under the 2007 Credit Agreement at the time of its termination were continued under the March 2011 Credit Agreement and the remainder were continued under the New Credit Agreements.
The New Secured Credit Agreement provides for issuance of letters of credit up to $650,000,000. The New Unsecured Credit Agreement is a $1,350,000,000 facility that provides for issuance of letters of credit and up to $1,000,000,000 of revolving credit loans. The Company has the option to increase the maximum amount of letters of credit available by an additional $500,000,000 across the facilities under the New Credit Agreements.
Interest and fees payable under the New Credit Agreements are determined pursuant to the terms set forth in each respective agreement. The commitments under each New Credit Agreement commenced on December 9, 2011 and expire on the earlier of (i) December 9, 2015 and (ii) the date of termination in whole of the commitments upon an optional termination or reduction of the commitments by the Account Parties or upon an event of default. The availability of letters of credit under the Secured Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base requirement, determined on the basis of specified percentages of the face value of eligible categories of assets varying by type of collateral.
The Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries that are Account Parties (i.e., parties to the New Credit Agreements) are: (a) XLIT Ltd., an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability (formerly XL Group Ltd.) ("XLIT"), (b) X.L. America, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("XLA"), XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd, a Bermuda limited liability company ("XLIB"), (c) XL Re Ltd, a Bermuda limited liability company ("XLRe"), (d) XL Insurance Company Limited, a limited company domiciled in the United Kingdom ("XLICL"), (e) XL Insurance Switzerland Ltd, a company limited by shares organized under the laws of Switzerland ("XLIS"), (f) XL Re Europe, an Irish limited liability company ("XLRe Europe"), and (g) XL Life Ltd, a Bermuda company ("XLL").
The parties to the New Secured Credit Agreement are the Account Parties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPM"), as administrative agent, The Bank of New York Mellon ("BNYM"), as collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto. The parties to the New Unsecured Credit Agreement are the Account Parties, JPM, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The parties to the Amendment are the Account Parties, JPM, as administrative agent, BNYM, as collateral agent, and the lenders party to the March 2011 Credit Agreement.
Each of the Company, XLIT, XLA, XLIB, XLRe and XLL guarantees the obligations of the other Account Parties under each New Credit Agreement. Each New Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth and a maximum ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth, and that require each of XLIB, XLRe and XLRe Europe to maintain a financial strength rating of no less than "A-" from A.M. Best & Co. In addition, the New Credit Agreements contain other customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of these types as well as certain customary events of default.
The obligations of each of the Account Parties under the New Secured Credit Agreement are secured by cash and certain designated securities that are pledged to the Collateral Agent by each Account Party pursuant to a pledge agreement (the "Pledge Agreement") and a collateral account control agreement.
The foregoing descriptions of the New Secured Credit Agreement, the New Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Amendment and the Pledge Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

XL Group (and in the case of any specific Letter of Credit, the Specified Account Party on behalf of which such Letter of Credit was issued) shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof by XL Group.
Certificates from Lenders
                    (d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that XL Group and any Specified Account Party shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies XL Group of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

A certificate setting forth the Administrative Agent's, the Collateral Agent's or such Lender's, as the case may be, good faith determination of the amount of such payment or liability (along with a reasonably detailed explanation and computation of such payment or liability) delivered to XL Group by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its
Indemnification by the Account Parties
own behalf, the Collateral Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive as between such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and the Account Parties absent manifest error.

In addition, each U.S. Lender and each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by it. Each U.S. Lender and each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Specified Account Party and the Administrative Agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Specified Account Party (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no U.S. Lender or Non-U.S. Lender shall be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.
                    (2) If a payment made to any recipient under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such recipient were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such recipient shall deliver to each Account Party and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by any Account Party or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by any Account Party or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Account Parties and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether such recipient has complied with such recipient's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.11(f)(2), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each recipient agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered under this clause expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Account Parties and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
                    (3) Each U.S. Lender and each Non-U.S Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Specified Account Party is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Specified Account Party (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Specified Account Party or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; that such U.S. Lender or Non-U.S. Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in its reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice its legal or commercial position.
provided
                    (g) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund from the relevant Governmental Authority of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by an Account Party or with respect to which
an Account Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay over such refund to such Account Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Account Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that such Account Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Account Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes not expressly required to be made available hereunder which it reasonably deems confidential) to any Account Party or any other Person.
provided
                    SECTION 2.12. .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
                    (a) . Each Account Party shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of fees, reimbursement of LC Disbursements or interest thereon, under Section 2.10 or 2.11, or otherwise) or under any other Credit Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim; that any payments in respect of Alternative Currency Letters of Credit shall be made in the manner (including the time and place of payment) as shall have been separately agreed between the relevant Account Party and Lender pursuant to Section 2.06. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 1111 Fannin Street, Houston, Texas except payments pursuant to Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 10.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
Payments by the Account Parties
provided
                    (b) . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
Application of Insufficient Payments
                    (c) . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: each reimbursement of LC Disbursements (other than in respect of Alternative Currency Letters of
Pro Rata Treatment
Credit) shall be made to the relevant Lenders, each payment of fees under Section 2.08 shall be made for account of the relevant Lenders, each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.07 and any interest paid in respect of any Reimbursement Obligation shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, in each case pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (or, in the case of any such reimbursement or payment after the termination of the Commitments, pro rata according to the Aggregate LC Exposure).
                    (d) . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any of its LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) or accrued interest thereon resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other relevant Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) of such other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of their respective LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) and accrued interest thereon; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Account Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Account Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Account Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law and to the extent that it is a Specified Account Party, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Account Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Account Party in the amount of such participation.
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
provided
                    (e) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from an Account Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the relevant Lenders hereunder that such Account Party will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Account Party has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the relevant Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Account Party has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment
                    (f) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to this Agreement, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10, or if any Account Party is required to pay any additional amount or indemnification payment to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.11, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. XL Group hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Nothing in this Section 2.13(a) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Account Parties or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Sections 2.10 or 2.11.
Designation of a Different Lending Office
                    (b) . If any Lender (i) requests compensation under Section 2.10, or if any Account Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11, (ii) becomes a Defaulting Lender, (iii) has refused to consent to any waiver or amendment with respect to any Credit Document that requires the consent of all the Lenders or of such Lender as a Lender directly and adversely affected by such waiver or amendment and has been consented to by the Required Lenders or (iv) if any Lender ceases to be a NAIC Approved Bank, then XL Group may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee selected by XL Group that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) XL Group shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to its outstanding LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding LC Disbursements and accrued interest and fees) or the relevant Account Party (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.10 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.11, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the relevant Account Party to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
Replacement of Lenders
provided
                    (c) The Account Parties shall not be responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by any Lender that arranges for its obligations under the Letters of Credit to be confirmed by a NAIC Approved Bank or by such confirming bank.
                    SECTION 2.14. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:

provided
                    (c) if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing then:
                    (d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Obligors in accordance with clause (c) above, and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (c)(i) above (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
                    In the event that the Administrative Agent, XL Group and each Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment.
                    SECTION 2.15. . In the event that XL Insurance (Bermuda), XL Re or XL Re Europe ceases to receive a financial strength rating from A.M. Best & Co. (or its successor), such Account Party shall no longer be entitled to request the issuance of further Letters of Credit hereunder.

Each Guarantor hereby further jointly and severally agrees that if any Account Party (other than such Guarantor in its capacity as an Account Party hereunder) shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, such Guarantor will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

Reinstatement
Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

                    The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Account Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
                    The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Account Party or any of their Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by an Account Party or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
                    The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Account Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
                    The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
                    The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Account Parties. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with XL Group, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by XL Group to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between XL Group and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
                    Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
                    Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints The Bank of New York Mellon to serve initially as Collateral Agent hereunder and authorizes the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Bank of New York Mellon and any person succeeding it as Collateral Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Collateral Agent, and The Bank of New York Mellon or such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Account Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Collateral Agent hereunder.
                    The Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents to which it is a party, including but not limited to the Pledge Agreement and the Control Agreement, and the Collateral Agent is hereby authorized and directed in such capacity to enter, execute, deliver and perform under such agreements and any amendments thereto from time to time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Collateral Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Collateral Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Collateral Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Account Party or any of their Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Collateral Agent by an Account Party or a Lender, and the Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Collateral Agent is authorized to follow and rely upon all notices, requests, directions and instructions given by officers named in incumbency certificates furnished to the Collateral Agent from time to time by the parties hereto, and the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in executing
any request, direction and instruction from any officer of a party named in an incumbency certificate delivered hereunder prior to receipt by it of a more current certificate. The Collateral Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Collateral Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Account Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
                    The Collateral Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent.
                    The Collateral Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Administrative Agent and the Account Parties. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with XL Group, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Collateral Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Collateral Agent's resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (1) the retiring Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Collateral Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Collateral Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Collateral Agent and the retiring Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by XL Group to a successor Collateral Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between XL Group and such successor. After the Collateral Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Collateral Agent.
                    Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Collateral Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Collateral Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
                    The Collateral Agent shall (a) not be responsible for any recitals contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by it under, this Agreement, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement (other than as against the Collateral Agent), any Collateral or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by any other Person (except the Collateral Agent) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or for the perfection, priority or maintenance of any security interest created hereunder; and (b) not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
                    No provision of this Agreement shall require the Collateral Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder.
                    The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation or responsibility to file UCC financing or continuation statements (except as expressly directed in writing by the Administrative Agent) or to determine whether the filing of any such statements is at any time necessary.
                     The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon any certification, order, judgment, opinion, notice or other written communication (including, without limitation, any thereof by electronic means, telecopy or facsimile) believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons (without being required to determine the correctness of any fact stated therein) and consult with and conclusively rely upon advice, opinions and statements of legal counsel and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with instructions given by the Administrative Agent.
                     Whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Agreement the Collateral Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, or omitting to take, or suffering any action hereunder, or suffering to exist any state of events, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Collateral Agent, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate of an officer of the Administrative Agent delivered to the Collateral Agent, and such certificate, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Collateral Agent, shall be full warrant to the Collateral Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance thereon.
                    The Collateral Agent shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, entitlement order, approval or other paper or document.

                     The Collateral Agent shall have the right to appoint agents or advisors in connection with any of its duties hereunder, and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by, or in reliance upon the advice of, such agents or advisors selected in good faith.
                    In no event shall Collateral Agent be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or caused directly or indirectly, by circumstances beyond its control, including, without limitation, acts of God; earthquake; fires; floods; wars; civil or military disturbances; terrorist acts; sabotage; epidemics; riots; interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities; or acts of civil or military authority or governmental actions; it being understood that the Collateral Agent shall use commercial reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as practicable under such circumstances.

                    The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to seek written directions from the Administrative Agent prior to taking any action under this Agreement or any other Credit Document and shall be fully protected and indemnified hereunder in respect of any action taken or not taken in accordance with any directions received from the Administrative Agent; that such protection and indemnity shall not apply to the extent that the Collateral Agent has acted with gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

                    (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "") may grant to a special purpose vehicle (an "") of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Account Parties, the option to provide to the Account Parties all or any part of any LC Disbursement that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Account Parties pursuant to Section 2.01, that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any LC Disbursement, (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such LC Disbursement, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such LC Disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof and shall in any case remain responsible to the other parties for the performance of its obligations under the terms of this Agreement and shall remain the Lender for all purposes hereunder (including, without limitation, with respect to the rights and responsibilities to deliver all consents and waivers required or requested under this Agreement with respect to its SPV) and (iii) the Account Parties may bring any proceeding against either or both the Granting Lender or the SPV in order to enforce any rights of the Account Parties hereunder. The making of a LC Disbursement by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such LC Disbursement were made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Lender makes such payment.

not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Account Party has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the relevant Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Account Party has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
                    (f) .

XL Group hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Nothing in this Section 2.21(a) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Account Parties or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Sections 2.17 or 2.19.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the relevant Account Party to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
                    (c) The Account Parties shall not be responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by any Lender that arranges for its obligations under the Letters of Credit to be confirmed by a NAIC Approved Bank or by such confirming bank.

                              (ii) if the applicable Account Party cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Participant LC Exposure that has not been reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, no Specified Account Party shall be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.08 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's Participant LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
                              (iii) if the Participant LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to
Section 2.14 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and
                              (iv) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Participant LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all fees payable under Section 2.14 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Participant LC Exposure shall be payable to the Administrative Agent until and to the extent that such Participant LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
                    (d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding Participant LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Obligors in accordance with clause (c) above, and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (c)(i) above (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
                    In the event that the Administrative Agent, XL Group and each Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the aggregate Participant LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from an Account Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the relevant Lenders hereunder that such Account Party will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Account Party has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the relevant Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Account Party has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment

XL Group hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Nothing in this Section 2.13(a) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Account Parties or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Sections 2.10 or 2.11.
Designation of a Different Lending Office

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the relevant Account Party to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
Replacement of Lenders
provided

increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (c)(i) above (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
                    In the event that the Administrative Agent, XL Group and each Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment.

          (b) Each Pledgor agrees to pay all expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and charges (including time charges of attorneys who are employees of the Collateral Agent), paid or incurred by the Collateral Agent in endeavoring to collect the Liabilities of such Pledgor, or any part thereof, and in enforcing this Agreement against such Pledgor, and such obligations will themselves be Liabilities.
          (c) No delay on the part of the Collateral Agent in the exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Collateral Agent of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.
          (d) This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments have terminated, all Liabilities have been paid in full and each Letter of Credit has terminated or expired pursuant to the Credit Agreement. At such time, the Administrative Agent in writing will instruct the Collateral Agent to provide the Custodian with written instructions in the form required to terminate the Control Agreement. If at any time all or any part of any payment theretofore applied by the Collateral Agent to any of the Liabilities is or must be rescinded or returned by the Collateral Agent for any reason whatsoever (including the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Pledgor), such Liabilities shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, to the extent that such payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence, notwithstanding such application by the Collateral Agent, and this Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such Liabilities, all as though such application by the Collateral Agent had not been made.
          (e) Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
          (f) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.
          (g) The rights and privileges of the Collateral Agent hereunder shall inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns. No Person other than the parties hereto is an intended or third-party beneficiary of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
          (h) This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Agreement.
          (i) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Pledgor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
          (j) Neither the Collateral Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including

The foregoing indemnity shall be a continuing obligation of the Pledgors and their respective successors and assigns, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.
          (l) The Collateral Agent may conclusively rely on an Enforcement Event Notice received from the Administrative Agent, without any further inquiry or investigation of any kind, for so long as it has not received written notice of the rescission of such Enforcement Event Notice by and from the Administrative Agent. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, at any such time after its initial delivery of an Enforcement Event Notice in respect of a Pledgor to the extent no Event of Default remains continuing with respect to such Pledgor, the Administrative Agent shall deliver a notice of rescission to the Collateral Agent informing it that the Enforcement Event Notice has been rescinded.
          (m) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (i) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
          (p) The obligations of each Pledgor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be impaired by any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of, any right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Credit Document.
          (q) Any Person that is required to execute a counterpart of this Agreement after the date hereof pursuant to the requirements of the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document shall become a Pledgor hereunder by (x) executing a counterpart hereof and delivering same to the Collateral Agent, or by executing an assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the Administrative Agent), (y) delivering supplements to Schedule I and II as are necessary to cause such schedules to be complete and accurate with respect to such additional Pledgor on such date and complying with Section 10.14 of the Credit Agreement and (z) taking all actions as specified in this Agreement as would have been taken by such Pledgor had it been an original party to this Agreement, in each case with all documents required above to be delivered to the Collateral Agent and with all documents and actions required above to be taken to the reasonable satisfaction of the Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the Administrative Agent).

          (t) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto agrees that the Administrative Agent may provide multiple directions and/or instructions to the Collateral Agent in a single writing; that no such instructions or directions shall relate to contingent events in the future.
