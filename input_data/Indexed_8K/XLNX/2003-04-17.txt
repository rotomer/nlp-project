"Sales in the March quarter exceeded our expectations. Demand in Europe and Asia was particularly strong during the quarter increasing 20% and 26% sequentially, respectively. The strength in Europe was broad-based, while the strength in Asia was driven by increased consumer transfer business from North American customers. International sales now represent a record 55% of total Xilinx revenue," said Wim Roelandts, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Earlier this week, Xilinx introduced the Spartan-3

FPGA family, which marks new milestones for the programmable logic industry. First, it is the only Programmable Logic Device (PLD) shipping on 90nm technology, which enables up to 80 percent chip-size reduction when compared to competing products on 130nm technology. This low cost family opens vast new business opportunities in high volume, high growth applications that have traditionally been served by Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)."
 
Fiscal 2003 was a year of solid financial performance for Xilinx in spite of the sluggish overall economy and a weak technology sector. Revenues of $1.16 billion increased by 14% in fiscal 2003 as new Xilinx products experienced strong customer acceptance and diversified into new markets and applications. Cash and investments increased by $310 million to a record $1.1 billion. Finally, Xilinx exited the year with a fourth quarter operating margin of 20%, up from 15% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the highest in the PLD industry.
