 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today released its business update for the September quarter of fiscal 2005.
SAN JOSE, CA, SEPTEMBER 14, 2004
 
September quarter revenues are expected to be down 5%-7% sequentially, a decrease from original guidance of up 2% to 4% sequentially.
 - 
                 
Gross margin target is expected to be approximately 64%, slightly lower than prior guidance of 65%.
 - 
                 
As a result of lower revenue levels, inventory days at Xilinx and distribution are expected to be approximately 155 days, up from prior guidance of 135-140 days.
 - 
                 
Sales from Asia Pacific are expected to be down double digits sequentially.  Weakness in Asia Pacific relates primarily to excess inventories held by US-based customers with manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific as well as to softening domestic orders.
 -
