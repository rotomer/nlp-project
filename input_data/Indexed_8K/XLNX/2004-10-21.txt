XILINX REPORTS 53% INCREASE IN PROFITS; NEW PRODUCTS POST STRONG REVENUE GROWTH
 
SAN JOSE, CA, OCTOBER 21, 2004
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced revenues of $403 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, a sequential decrease of 5% from the prior quarter and an increase of 28% from the same quarter a year ago.  Net income was $86 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $56 million and $0.16 per diluted share in the prior year.
 
Xilinx also announced today that the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on December 1, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2004.
 
Additional fiscal second quarter comparisons are represented in the chart below.
 
Quarterly Information
(In millions, except EPS)
 
 
European revenues, which are typically seasonally slow in the September quarter, were better than expected increasing 3% sequentially and 45% versus the same quarter a year ago. Much of this increase was driven by strength in the communications, industrial and automotive sectors.  However, sales to Asia Pacific were weak during the quarter, declining 15% sequentially. Much of this weakness was attributable to excess inventories at a few US-based customers with manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific and a slowdown within the China market for technology products.
 
"New product sales increased 44% sequentially and represented 17% of total Xilinx sales, up from 6% a year ago.  This is a strong testament to the customer acceptance and design win momentum of these products," said Wim Roelandts, Xilinx's chairman and chief executive officer.  "Virtex-II Pro FPGA sales increased nearly 70% sequentially as several customer design wins began moving into volume production.  CoolRunner-II CPLD sales nearly doubled sequentially.  Additionally, sales from the Spartan family of FPGAs increased to nearly 22% of total Xilinx revenues, up from 19% in the same quarter a year ago.  Most of this growth was driven by Spartan-IIe and Spartan-3 products, which are found in wide ranging applications such as digital television, media servers, automotive telematics and multi-function printers."

Product Highlights:
 
Xilinx began shipping two additional Virtex-4 devices during the quarter bringing the total number of devices shipping to three. Manufactured using the world's first triple-oxide 90nm CMOS technology with 11-layer metal interconnect, Virtex-4 devices offer significant performance and power advantages versus competing solutions.  Additionally, Xilinx introduced its latest generation software, ISE 6.3i, which supports up to 200,000 logic cells and 500 MHz performance. The combination of ISE 6.3i and Virtex-4 FPGAs enables up to 40% faster FPGA fabric performance than the nearest competing offering.

Xilinx continues to be the only PLD company in volume production at 90-nanometer technology.  Xilinx is currently shipping its Spartan-3 and Virtex-4 FPGAs on 90nm technology and has shipped over one million 90nm devices since its introduction of the Spartan-3 family in April, 2003.
 - 
                               
Xilinx recently announced a strategic foundry relationship with Toshiba.  Together, the companies have achieved a key manufacturing milestone with the successful production of functional 90nm silicon at Toshiba's state-of-the-art 300mm wafer fabrication facility at Oita, in Kyushu, Japan.
 - 
                               
 
Xilinx announced the creation of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Embedded Processing Divisions, demonstrating the importance of these two technologies in future PLD design. By focusing resources in these critical areas, Xilinx will be able to capitalize on an incremental market opportunity estimated by Gartner Dataquest to be approximately $7 billion.
