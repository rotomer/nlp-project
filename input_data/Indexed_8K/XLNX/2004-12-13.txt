XILINX BUSINESS UPDATE FOR DECEMBER QUARTER FISCAL 2005
 
 
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today released its business update for the December quarter of fiscal 2005.
SAN JOSE, CA, DECEMBER 8, 2004
 
Strong sales in the month of October were followed by weaker than expected turns bookings across all geographies in the month of November.   Although turns bookings have increased in the first week of the month of December, this strength is not expected to continue due to normal seasonality experienced during the holidays.  As a result, Xilinx is now expecting sales to decrease 5% to 8% sequentially in the December quarter.  This is down from prior guidance of down 2% to 6% sequentially.
 - 
                 
Gross margin target is expected to be approximately 64%, unchanged from prior guidance.
 - 
                 
As a result of lower revenue levels, inventory days at Xilinx and distribution are expected to be approximately 170 days, up from prior guidance of 156 days.
 -
