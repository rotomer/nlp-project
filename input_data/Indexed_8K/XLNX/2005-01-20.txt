SAN JOSE, CA, JANUARY 20, 2005
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced revenues of $355 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, a sequential decrease of 12% from the prior quarter and a decrease of 3% from the same quarter a year ago.  Net income was $64 million or $0.18 per diluted share including a $3.1 million charge relating to impairment losses on investments as well as a $5.5 million tax benefit associated primarily with a recent IRS settlement.  This compares to net income of $69 million and $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year.
 
Xilinx also announced today that the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on March 2, 2005 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2005.
 
Additional fiscal third quarter comparisons are represented in the chart below.
 
Quarterly Information
(In millions, except EPS)
 
 
Excess inventory levels at end customers led to weaker than expected orders during the quarter, particularly in the telecom sector.  Sales from communications customers decreased 22% sequentially and represented 47% of total revenues, down from 53% last quarter.  All geographies declined sequentially.
 
"It was a challenging quarter for Xilinx and the PLD industry," said Wim Roelandts, Xilinx's Chairman and CEO.  "However, I remain encouraged by our solid new product execution which has enabled us to introduce an unprecedented number of devices during the last six months.  Additionally, as we exit 2004, I expect Xilinx to capture PLD market segment share for the seventh consecutive calendar year."
