Highlights  Fiscal year 2005:
 
Xilinx's share of the PLD market segment increased for the 7 calendar year in a row.   According to independent market research firm, Gartner Dataquest, Xilinx's share of the PLD market segment in calendar 2004 was 51%, up from 50% in 2003 and up from 35% in calendar 1999.

for their particular application.  This enables Xilinx to address key market segments such as Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and embedded processing that offer incremental market opportunity.  Xilinx is currently shipping 12 members of the Virtex-4 family.  The latest device to ship, the LX200, is the world's highest density device, with 30 percent more logic capacity than the closest competing FPGA. Virtex-4 FPGAs provide customers with key competitive advantages in every aspect of performance, up to 73% lower static power, and seven times better signal integrity
 
Since its introduction in 1998, Spartan FPGAs have driven Xilinx's success in diversified, high volume market segments such as consumer electronics and automotive telematics.  Sales from Spartan FPGAs increased 24% in fiscal 2005 versus the prior fiscal year and represented 22% of total revenues at the end of the fiscal year, up from 5% five years ago.   Sales from the newest Spartan family, Spartan-3, increased more than 50% in the most recent quarter, generating more in sales than any other 90nm PLD product in the industry. During the year we complemented this successful family with the introduction of the Spartan-3E family, which delivers more logic per dollar than any other programmable device, and the Spartan-3L family, which is optimized for low power applications.

Xilinx CPLD sales grew faster in fiscal 2005 than any other supplier, driving solid market share gains and making Xilinx the second largest supplier of CPLDs for the first time in company history.  Xilinx estimates its share of the CPLD market segment to be approximately 26%, up from 22% last year and up from 11% five years ago.

During the year, Xilinx introduced v7.1i of ISE to its growing user base of more than 200,000 designers.  Besides averaging a 15% logic performance advantage over its nearest competitor, ISE integrates with the System Generator for DSP, the Embedded Developers Kit for embedded processing design ChipScope Pro for real time in-silicon verification. With 15,000 new users a quarter, ISE continues to grow in popularity as evidenced by Xilinx being rated #1 FPGA EDA tool vendor in a survey conducted by a leading electronics engineering publication, winning in all major categories.

During the year, Xilinx announced the creation of the DSP and Embedded Processing Solutions Divisions.  Both of these divisions combine the Company's domain expertise and comprehensive offering of systems solutions with its leading-edge portfolio of intellectual property cores and development tools. The new organizational structure reinforces Xilinx's commitment to the increasingly diverse, changing needs of FPGA designers throughout the world.

A solid cash position coupled with consistently high cash flow generation enabled Xilinx to launch the PLD industry's first dividend program in the June quarter of fiscal 2005.   Xilinx recently raised its quarterly dividend and increased its stock repurchase program.  With over $1.6 billion in cash and investments, Xilinx remains the industry's only investment grade PLD company.

For the fourth year in a row, Xilinx placed in the top ten of FORTUNE Magazine's annual listing of "100 Best Places to Work For," ranking highest among all technology electronics companies.  A culture of innovation was cited by the magazine as a key reason for the number five ranking this year.
