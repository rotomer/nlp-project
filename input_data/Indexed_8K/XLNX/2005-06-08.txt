XILINX UPDATES GUIDANCE FOR JUNE QUARTER FY06
 
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today released its business update for the June quarter of fiscal 2006.
SAN JOSE, CA, JUNE 8, 2005
 
June quarter guidance is unchanged.  Prior guidance called for sales growth to be flat to up 4% sequentially.
 - 
                 
 
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 61%, unchanged from the March quarter's gross margin, due to the higher than anticipated ramp of 90nm product revenues.
 - 
                 
 
Combined inventory levels at Xilinx and worldwide distributors are expected to trend down to approximately 130 days, consistent with prior guidance.
 - 
                 
 
No conference call will be held in conjunction with this guidance revision.  Additional commentary pertaining to the quarter will be available when the company reports its first quarter financial results on July 21, 2005.
