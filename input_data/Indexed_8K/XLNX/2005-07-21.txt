New product sales were strong during the quarter increasing 22% sequentially with all products in this category posting growth.  Sales of Xilinx's 90nm products, Spartan-3and Virtex-4, were exceptionally strong during the quarter, increasing nearly 90% sequentially as a result of robust design win activity across a broad base of end market segments.  "Design win momentum is rapidly shifting to 90nm technology.  With a substantial revenue lead over the competition and capacity from two of the world's leading foundries, Xilinx has a substantial competitive lead in this process technology," said Wim Roelandts, Chairman and CEO.
 
Continued expense controls and a decline in mask costs resulted in June quarter operating margin increasing to 22% of revenues, up from 21% last quarter.  Inventory days decreased six days during the quarter to 105 days.
