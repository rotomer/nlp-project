XILINX UPDATES GUIDANCE FOR SEPTEMBER QUARTER
 
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today released its business update for the September quarter of fiscal 2006.
SAN JOSE, CA, SEPTEMBER 7, 2005
 
September quarter sales guidance is unchanged.  Prior guidance called for sales growth to be flat to up 4% sequentially.
 - 
                 
 
Gross margin guidance of 61% to 62% is unchanged.
 - 
                 
 
Sales from 90nm products are expected to approach 10% of total revenues.
 - 
                 
 
The September quarter tax rate will decline to approximately 15% from our prior guidance of 24%, primarily due to the recent favorable tax court decision pertaining to cost sharing and the release of related reserves.
 - 
                 
 
No conference call will be held in conjunction with this guidance revision.  Additional commentary pertaining to the quarter will be available when the company reports its second quarter financial results on October 21, 2005.
