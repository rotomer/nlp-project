Turns business, which are orders that are booked and shipped within the quarter, were weaker than anticipated in the month of September.  Most of this weakness was concentrated among large communications and storage companies that have manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific.  Combined sales from Xilinx's 90-nanometer products, Virtex-4 and Spartan-3, doubled sequentially, meeting expectations and representing 10% of total revenues.
 
"The September quarter was a challenging quarter.  I am pleased, however, with the growth of our 90nm products.  Additionally, significant yield improvements on these products during the quarter positively impacted gross margin which increased to 61.4%, up from 60.9% in the prior quarter," said Wim Roelandts, Chairman and CEO.
