XILINX RAISES DECEMBER QUARTER SALES GUIDANCE
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today released its business update for the December quarter of fiscal 2006.
SAN JOSE, CA, DECEMBER 7, 2005
 
December quarter sales are now expected to increase 4% to 8% sequentially as a result of better than expected sales from customers in North America and Asia Pacific.  This is up from prior guidance of up 1% to 5% sequentially.
 - 
                 
 
Gross margin guidance of 62% to 63% is unchanged.
 - 
                 
 
Pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the company has elected to repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings.  As a consequence, the company will record a tax charge of approximately $27 million in the December quarter related to the extraordinary dividend.
 - 
                 
 
The effective tax rate for the year, excluding the repatriation, is expected to increase to 23%, up from previous guidance of 21% - 22%.  This is due to greater forecasted profits in the United States than originally expected.
 - 
                 
 
No conference call will be held in conjunction with this guidance revision.  Additional commentary pertaining to the quarter will be available when the company reports its third quarter financial results on January 19, 2006.
