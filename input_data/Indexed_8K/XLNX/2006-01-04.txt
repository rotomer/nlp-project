XILINX RAISES DECEMBER QUARTER SALES GUIDANCE
 
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today raised its sales guidance for the December quarter of fiscal 2006.

December quarter sales are expected to increase approximately 11%-12% sequentially driven by broad based end market strength and strong sales growth in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe.  This is an increase from prior guidance of up 4% to 8% sequentially, which was provided during the company's business update on December 7.
