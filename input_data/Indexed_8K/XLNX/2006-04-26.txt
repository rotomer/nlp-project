SAN JOSE, CA, APRIL 26, 2006

The tax provision for the fourth quarter includes an $8.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, benefit related to prior year adjustments driven primarily by an over provision of state income taxes. This is compared to net income of $81.0 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the prior quarter.

Highlights  Fiscal Year 2006:
 
Introduced in September 2004, the Virtex-4 family of FPGAs now generates more in 90nm sales than any other PLD family. Strong design win activity from broad-based end markets drove significant sales growth from all three domain-optimized platforms in fiscal 2006. Virtex-4 FPGAs were named Ultimate Product of the Year at the Annual Creativity in Electronics (ACE) 2006 Award Gala, which recognized the electronics engineering industry's most innovative companies and breakthrough technologies.

EE Times
 
For the 8th consecutive year, sales from the Xilinx Spartan Series increased as a percentage of total sales representing a record 24% of total net revenues in fiscal year 2006, up from 21% last year and up from 8% five years ago. The success of the Spartan series is reflected in increased sales exposure to high-volume applications such as consumer, automotive and high-volume networking as well as in the total number of Spartan customers which has increased by almost 60% over the last five years. While

the Virtex-4 family claims 90nm FPGA sales leadership, the Spartan-3 family maintains leadership in number of 90nm units shipped.
 
Fiscal 2006 marked the 5th consecutive year of market segment share gains for Xilinx CPLDs. Currently, Xilinx estimates its share of the CPLD segment to be over 28%, up from 12% five years ago. Market segment share gains and record CPLD sales are primarily due to the success of the Xilinx low-power CoolRunner Series, which has made significant advances into the portable applications space, most notably handheld devices.

In March 2006, Xilinx demonstrated first silicon of its new 65nm generation Virtex FPGA family and has started delivering software and engineering samples to early access customers.

Xilinx unveiled a strategy and set of product roadmaps to address the $2 billion high-performance DSP market, including XtremeDSP solutions that accelerate the development of multimedia, video and imaging systems. Additionally, Xilinx strengthened its commitment to FPGA-based DSP system design with the acquisition of AccelChip, Inc., a provider of DSP design tools.

In December 2005, Xilinx announced the 8.1i release of its popular Integrated Software Environment (ISE) design tool suite with enhanced physical synthesis capabilities to improve performance and timing closure for both the Virtex-4 and Spartan-3 architectures. Earlier in the year, Xilinx introduced version 4.00 of its MicroBlaze soft processor, which enables embedded developers to accelerate system performance by as much as 120 times over software emulation.
