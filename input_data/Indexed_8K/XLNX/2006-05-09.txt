Item 5.03(a) Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.
 
On May 3, 2006, the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") amended its bylaws as follows:
 
Section 2.14, Prior Notice for Inclusion on Agenda, was amended and restated to provide for a process for proposals to be brought by stockholders or nominations for directors to be made by stockholders at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders or at a meeting called expressly for the election of directors.  Previously, the bylaws required that written notice of a nomination for diretor or other stockholder proposal be provided no less than ninety (90) days prior to the stockholder meeting at which the nomination or other matter is intended to be raised.
 
Section 3.2 was amended to change the size of the Board of Directors from a fixed number of 10 directors to a range of seven to eleven directors, with the exact number to be fixed by the Board of Diretors.  This range shall not be altered without prior stockholder approval.
 
Section 3.4 of the bylaws was amended to change the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections.  A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director.  In contested elections, where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast.
 
In addition, if a nominee who already serves as director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors (the "Board").  Within 120 days of the certification of election results, the Board will publicly disclose its decision regarding whether to accept or reject the resignation and the rationale behind it.  The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.  If the failure of a nominee to be elected at the annual meeting results in a vacancy on the Board, that vacancy can be filled by action of the Board.
 
The resolution of the Board of Directors amending the bylaws is effective as of May 3, 2006 and is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

promulgated thereunder.  Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.

and;
 
, that Section 3.2 of the Bylaws, , is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER
NUMBERS OF DIRECTORS
 
The number of directors that shall constitute the whole board of directors shall be not less than seven (7) nor more than eleven (11), the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time within such range by a duly adopted resolution of the board of directors.  This range shall not be altered without stockholder approval.
 
and;
 
, that Section 3.3 of the Bylaws is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER
 
"Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to such director at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting; that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.  Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified, or until death, resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided, or until he or she shall cease to qualify.  For the purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for' a director must exceed the number of shares voted against' that director.  If a director is not elected, such director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the board of directors.  The board of directors will decide whether to accept or reject such resignation, or whether other action shall be taken.  The board of directors will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it promptly but no later than 120 days following the date of the certification of the election results.  In reaching its decision, the board of directors may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to the corporation, the overall composition of the board of directors, the underlying reasons for the outcome of the stockholders' vote with respect to the director (if ascertainable) and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the corporation to fail to meet any applicable rule or regulation.  No director who so offers to tender his or her resignation shall participate in the board of directors' decision or in the nominating and governance
provided
committee's recommendation.  If a majority of the members of the nominating and governance committee fail to receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to each such director at the same meeting of stockholders, then the independent directors who did receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to each such director will appoint a committee of the board of directors amongst themselves for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and making a recommendation to the board of directors with respect to such tendered resignations.  If no directors receive the requisite majority vote at an annual or special meeting held for the purpose of electing directors where the election is uncontested, the incumbent board of directors will nominate a new slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees within 180 days after the certification of the stockholder vote.  In this circumstance, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.3, the incumbent board of directors will continue to serve until new directors are elected and qualified."
 
APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS this 3rd day of May, 2006.
