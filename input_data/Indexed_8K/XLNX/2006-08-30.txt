Item 8.01  Other Events
On August 25, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a Notice of Appeal (Appeal) that it appeals to the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit the August 30, 2005 decision of the U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court). In its 2005 decision, the Tax Court decided in favor of the Company and rejected the IRS's position that the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the Company's cost sharing agreement with its Irish affiliate.
The Company intends to oppose this Appeal as it believes that the Tax Court decided the case correctly, although there can be no assurances with respect to the outcome at this time. Furthermore, the Company expects that the Appeal will not have a material impact on its financial statements.
