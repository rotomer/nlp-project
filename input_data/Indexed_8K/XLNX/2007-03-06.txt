XILINX UPDATES MARCH QUARTER GUIDANCE
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today released its business update for the March quarter of fiscal 2007.
SAN JOSE, CA, MARCH 5, 2007
March quarter sales guidance range has been narrowed to flat to down 4% sequentially.  This is a change from flat to down 5% sequentially.
                 
Gross margin guidance is unchanged and expected to be approximately 61%, including $2 million of stock-based compensation.
                 
As a result of the convertible debt offering and concurrent share buyback, Xilinx expects the share count reduction to have a minimal impact to fourth quarter 2007 results. Other Income will be approximately $19 million. For fiscal year 2008, the Company expects a fully diluted share count of approximately 300 million based on the current stock price. Other Income will decline by approximately $31-32 million per year. All the repurchases of common stock are conditioned upon the closing of the offering of the debentures.
                 
No conference call will be held in conjunction with this guidance revision. Additional commentary pertaining to the quarter will be available when the company reports its fourth quarter financial results on April 25, 2007.
