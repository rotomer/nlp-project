SAN JOSE, CA, FEBRUARY 25, 2008
-- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced that its Board of Directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 from $0.12 per common share. Stockholders of record on May 7, 2008 will receive $0.14 per common share, payable on May 28, 2008.
The Board also approved an additional stock repurchase program whereby Xilinx is authorized to repurchase up to $800 million of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing of repurchases and the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased is dependent upon prevailing market conditions, share price and other factors.

The increased dividend and share repurchase program demonstrates our commitment to returning value to our stockholders," stated Moshe Gavrielov, chief executive officer.
