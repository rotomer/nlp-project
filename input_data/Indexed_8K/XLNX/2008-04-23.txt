Fiscal 2008 Highlights:
Ongoing efforts to improve operating margin and capital structure paid off in fiscal 2008. Operating margin was 23% in fiscal 2008, up from 19% in the prior fiscal year as a result of gross margin expansion coupled with expense reduction efforts. Annual return on equity was 22% in fiscal 2008, up from 16% in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to improved operating efficiency and capital structure. During the fiscal year, Xilinx repurchased 24 million shares of common stock and announced an increase in its dividend to $0.14 per diluted share, resulting in a dividend yield of 2.4%, higher than the dividend yield of the S&P 500.
  
Xilinx improved its 65nm sales leadership with strong growth from its Virtex-5 FPGA family. Shipping over a year before competing products, sales from the
  
Virtex-5 family increased more than 70% sequentially in the March quarter. Recently, Xilinx introduced Virtex-5 FXT devices which deliver in system integration for designs that demand high-performance processing and high-speed serial I/Os, enabling designers to reduce system costs, board space and component count. Xilinx estimates that it currently supplies over 90% of the PLD industry's 65nm sales.
Xilinx delivered the ISE Design Suite10.1, a single unified release providing FPGA logic, embedded and DSP designers with immediate access to the Company's entire line of design tools with full interoperability. The ISE Design Suite offers significantly faster implementations with an average of 2X faster run-times and up to 38% faster performance.
  
Xilinx realized record sales in the Consumer & Automotive and Industrial and Other end markets in fiscal 2008. These combined categories represented 49% of sales in fiscal 2008, up from 45% in the prior fiscal year and up from 36% three years ago. Growth in these end markets was primarily driven by strength in defense and automotive applications and validates the Company's focused end market diversification efforts.
