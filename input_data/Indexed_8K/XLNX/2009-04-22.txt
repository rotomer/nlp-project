March quarter sales declined 14% sequentially with sales from all geographies and end markets declining as expected. Xilinx operating expenses declined 4% sequentially, which was more than expected as a result of continued expense controls.
"Current economic conditions remain challenging for the semiconductor industry and Xilinx is no exception." said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. "However, strong 65-nm design win activity coupled with increased participation in end markets such as next generation wireless communications and defense have enabled Xilinx to outperform the semiconductor industry throughout the recent economic downturn."
