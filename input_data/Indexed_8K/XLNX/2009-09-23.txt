SAN JOSE, CA, SEPTEMBER 23, 2009
-- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today provided updated sales guidance for the September quarter of fiscal 2010.
September quarter sales are expected to be up approximately 10% sequentially. This is a revision from previous sales guidance of up approximately 2% to 6% sequentially. The increased sales guidance is primarily due to broad based strength across nearly all end markets and geographies.  
Virtex-5 sales are expected to increase significantly in the September quarter, surpassing 20% of total sales.  
We expect to ship the majority of last quarter's delinquencies in the September quarter.  
Gross margin guidance of approximately 61% and operating expense guidance of approximately $175 million, including $5 million in restructuring charges, remain unchanged.
No conference call will be held in conjunction with this guidance revision. Additional commentary pertaining to the quarter will be available when the company reports its second quarter financial results on October 14, 2009.
