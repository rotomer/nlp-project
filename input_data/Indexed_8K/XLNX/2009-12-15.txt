ITEM: Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers: Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Under the terms of the Plan, each of the three plan components, the share of revenue component, the operating profit component and the strategic component are eligible for payment on a semi-annual basis. For the first half of fiscal 2010, there was no payment under the share of revenue component. The payments above were made under the operating profit component and the strategic component only. All payments above were consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan with the exception of the strategic component payments made to Messrs. Gavrielov, Peng and Ratford. The deviation from the terms and conditions of the Plan related solely to the number of goals and relative weighting of the goals under the strategic component of the Plan and had no impact on the dollar amounts of any payments. The Plan provides that the strategic component will consist of a maximum of five goals, each with a minimum weighting of 20%. For the first half of fiscal 2010, Mr. Gavrielov was paid on the basis of six goals, four of which had a weighting under 20%; Mr. Peng was paid on the basis of five goals, two of which had a weighting below 20%; and Mr. Ratford was paid on the basis of five goals, three of which had a weighting below 20%.
The Compensation Committee approved all payments to the named executive officers with the exception of Mr. Gavrielov, whose payment was approved by the independent members of the Board of Directors.
