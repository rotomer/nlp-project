    On March 22, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the Appeals Court) affirmed the August 30, 2005 tax court decision that the value of compensatory stock options are not required to be included in the cost sharing agreement between Xilinx, Inc. (the Company) and its Irish affiliate, Xilinx Ireland (the March 2010 Decision).
 
     As previously disclosed, the Company had filed a suit against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
(Commissioner) in tax court disputing the Commissioners finding that the value of compensatory stock options were costs that were to be shared between Xilinx and its affiliate, Xilinx Ireland, under their cost sharing agreement. The tax court initially decided in favor of the Company and rejected the Commissioners position that the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the Companys cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. On August 25, 2006, the Commissioner appealed the tax court decision to the Appeals Court. On May 27, 2009, the Company received a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the tax court decision and holding that the Company should include stock option amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Company did not agree with the Appeals Court decision and filed a motion for rehearing on August 12, 2009. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009, and subsequently affirmed the tax court decision in the March 2010 Decision.
 
    
As a direct result of the March 2010 Decision, the Company would expect to receive a refund from the IRS of approximately $24.3 million and interest of approximately $9.4 million for the tax years 1997, 1998 and 1999. The Company is in the process of reviewing the potential impact the March 2010 Decision would have for all years open to IRS audit.
