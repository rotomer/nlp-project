ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure As previously disclosed, an ExxonMobil affiliate completed the sale of its copper mining business in Chile in November 2002. This sale followed the divestment of Colombian coal operations in the first quarter of 2002 and Australian coal operations in prior years. These businesses have historically been reported as other operations in our financial statements. In addition, management responsibility for certain continuing operations included in the other operations segment has been reassigned. Specifically, responsibility for electric power generation operations, primarily in Hong Kong, has been assigned to the newly-renamed ExxonMobil Gas & Power Marketing Company (part of our non-U.S. upstream business). Our remaining U.S. coal operations are now managed as part of the U.S. upstream. As a result of these changes, we will be changing the presentation of certain segment information in future financial reports in accordance with the accounting requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (FAS 131), "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (FAS 144), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". Specifically, our annual report for 2002 will show earnings for the divested coal and minerals businesses as discontinued operations. Also, earnings from electric power will be moved from other operations to the non-U.S. upstream and earnings from residual U.S. coal operations will be moved from other operations to the U.S. upstream. The remaining activities in the other operations segment, primarily involving captive insurance and global services, will be shown in the corporate and financing segment. Our earnings press release for the fourth quarter of 2002 and other future financial publications will be consistent with this new segmentation. In order to help investors become familiar with this new segment format in advance of our fourth quarter earnings release and 2002 annual report, we are furnishing below resegmented functional earnings, along with resegmented capital and exploration expenditures, for the full years 1998, 1999 and 2000, and for the quarterly periods in 2001 and year-to-date 2002. These changes in the presentation of segment information do not alter our total net income, net income per share, or capital and exploration expenditures for any period.
