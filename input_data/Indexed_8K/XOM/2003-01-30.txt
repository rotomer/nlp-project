Exhibit 99 News Release ExxonMobil Exxon Mobil Corporation 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard Irving, TX 75039-2298 972 444 1107 Telephone 972 444 1138 Facsimile FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 2003 EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES ESTIMATED ___________________________________________ FOURTH QUARTER AND 2002 RESULTS _______________________________ IRVING, TX, January 30 -- Exxon Mobil Corporation today reported fourth quarter results. Net income was $4,090 million ($0.60 per share), an increase of $1,410 million (53%) from the fourth quarter of 2001 and an increase of $1,450 million (55%) from the third quarter of 2002. Excluding merger effects, discontinued operations and other special items, fourth quarter 2002 earnings were $3,790 million ($0.56 per share), an increase of $921 million from the fourth quarter of 2001, and an increase of $861 million from the third quarter of 2002.
2 Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2002 totaled $56,211 million compared with $47,744 million in 2001. Capital and exploration expenditures of $4,025 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 were up $162 million compared with last year and were 13% higher than in this year's third quarter. ExxonMobil's Chairman Lee R. Raymond commented as follows: "ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2002 net income of $4,090 million was up $1,450 million or 55% from third quarter 2002 and represents the corporation's highest net income since the second quarter of 2001. Earnings excluding merger effects, discontinued operations and other special items were up $861 million at $3,790 million and continued the upward trend in results for each quarter in 2002. "Upstream earnings improved $510 million from the third quarter, reflecting higher natural gas prices and seasonally higher volumes. "Downstream earnings increased $696 million primarily due to improvements in worldwide refining and marketing margins from a weak third quarter. Earnings also benefited from a reduction in inventories. "Chemicals earnings fell by $277 million compared with the third quarter due to weaker worldwide margins. "Corporate and financing expenses of $109 million increased $68 million mainly due to the absence of favorable foreign exchange impacts. "Fourth quarter net income included after-tax merger expenses of $100 million and discontinued operations earnings of $400 million reflecting the gain on the sale of
3 Chilean copper operations. Net income in the fourth quarter 2001 included after-tax merger expenses of $200 million and discontinued operations earnings of $11 million. "Compared with last year's fourth quarter, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2002 net income of $4,090 million was up $1,410 million. Earnings excluding merger effects, discontinued operations and other special items were $3,790 million, up $921 million. "Upstream earnings were $3,002 million, an increase of $1,267 million from fourth quarter 2001 results. These upstream results reflect higher realizations on sales of crude oil and natural gas. On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 1% excluding the effect of OPEC quota restrictions. Liquids production, excluding the impact of OPEC quota restrictions, was flat as new production in Canada, Angola and Equatorial Guinea was offset by natural field decline. Natural gas volumes were up 3%, reflecting higher European demand and the return to full production levels at Arun in Indonesia. Plans for long-term capacity increases remain on track as reflected by higher capital spending. "Downstream earnings were $821 million, down $198 million from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting weaker industry-wide conditions. Marketing margins were weaker, with improvements in the U.S. more than offset by declines elsewhere. Refining margins were also lower in most areas worldwide. "Chemicals earnings of $76 million were down $133 million from last year's fourth quarter. Worldwide margins were lower as a result of higher feedstock costs in the fourth quarter of 2002.
4 "In the fourth quarter, ExxonMobil continued its active investment program, spending $4,025 million on capital and exploration projects, compared with $3,863 million last year, reflecting continued growth in upstream spending. "During the quarter, the corporation acquired 34 million shares at a gross cost of $1,181 million to offset the dilution associated with benefit plans and to reduce common stock outstanding. "ExxonMobil's full year 2002 net income of $11,460 million decreased $3,860 million from 2001 reflecting lower natural gas realizations and the poor market conditions in the downstream. "Capital and exploration expenditures of $13,955 million in 2002 were up $1,644 million, or 13%, compared with $12,311 million last year. Upstream capital spending was 18% higher, consistent with long term investment plans to sustain base capacity and expand profitable production. "Operating expenses for 2002 declined $300 million versus 2001. The decline was related to lower energy prices and additional efficiencies captured in all business lines. In 2002, these cost efficiencies exceeded one billion dollars and have cumulatively reached five billion dollars compared with pre-merger operations. "Cash flow from operations and asset sales for 2002 was $24 billion, equal to last year's level mainly due to increased asset sales. Cash flows were large enough to exceed requirements to fund the corporation's growing capital expenditure program, shareholder dividends and continuing share purchases."
5 Additional comments on earnings for the major operating segments follow: Fourth Quarter 2002 vs. Fourth Quarter 2001 ___________________________________________ Upstream earnings were $3,002 million, up $1,267 million from the fourth quarter 2001 reflecting higher crude oil and natural gas realizations. Oil-equivalent production was up 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year, excluding the impact of OPEC quota restrictions. Total actual oil-equivalent production was flat as contributions from new projects and work programs were offset by natural field declines and OPEC quota restrictions. Liquids production of 2,497 kbd (thousands of barrels per day) decreased from 2,527 kbd in the fourth quarter of 2001. Higher production in Canada, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea was more than offset by OPEC quota restrictions and natural field declines in mature areas. Liquids production was flat in the fourth quarter versus last year, excluding OPEC quota restrictions. Fourth quarter natural gas production increased to 11,667 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), compared with 11,373 mcfd last year. Higher European demand and the return to full production levels at Arun more than offset natural field decline in mature areas. Earnings from U.S. upstream operations were $757 million, up $339 million. Non-U.S. upstream earnings of $2,245 million were $928 million higher than last year's fourth quarter. Downstream earnings of $821 million decreased $198 million from the fourth quarter of last year. Marketing margins were weaker with improvements in the U.S. more than offset by declines elsewhere. Worldwide refining margins, although improved against prior quarters in 2002, were on average weaker than the fourth quarter of 2001. Earnings in both quarters benefited from planned reductions in
6 inventory levels. Petroleum product sales were 8,017 kbd, flat with last year's fourth quarter. U.S. downstream earnings were $403 million, up $122 million. Non-U.S. downstream earnings of $418 million were $320 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. Chemicals earnings of $76 million were down $133 million from the same quarter a year ago as weaker margins, and adverse tax impacts in Singapore, were partially offset by higher volumes. Prime product sales of 6,709 kt (thousands of metric tons) were up 337 kt, reflecting higher demand in key commodity businesses across most regions and supported by capacity additions in Singapore. During the period, the company continued to benefit from the favorable resolution of tax related issues. Fourth quarter net income also included $100 million of after-tax merger expenses, including costs for rationalization of facilities and systems. Reflecting the completion of merger-related activities, the segment for reporting merger expenses will not be used in 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 34 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1,181 million. These purchases were to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to reduce the number of shares outstanding. Shares outstanding were reduced from 6,729 million at the end of the third quarter of 2002 to 6,700 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be discontinued at any time.
7 Full Year 2002 vs. Full Year 2001 _________________________________ Net income of $11,460 million ($1.68 per share) decreased $3,860 million from 2001. Excluding merger effects, discontinued operations and other special items, earnings of $11,501 million decreased $4,027 million from 2001. Upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower natural gas realizations, particularly in North America, where prices reached historical highs at the beginning of 2001. Higher crude oil realizations partly offset declines in natural gas prices. Oil-equivalent production was up 1% versus 2001 excluding the impact of OPEC quota restrictions. Total actual oil-equivalent production was flat as the resumption of full production at Arun and contributions from new projects and work programs offset natural field declines and OPEC quota restrictions. Liquids production of 2,496 kbd decreased 46 kbd from 2001. Production increases from new projects in Angola, Canada, Malaysia and Venezuela offset natural field declines in mature areas. OPEC quota restrictions increased in 2002. Excluding the effect of these restrictions, liquids production was flat with 2001. Worldwide natural gas production of 10,452 mcfd in 2002 compared with 10,279 mcfd in 2001. Improvements in Asia-Pacific volumes, mainly from the return to full production levels at the Arun field in Indonesia following last year's curtailments due to security concerns, more than offset lower weather- related demand in Europe and natural field decline in the U.S. Weather-related demand in Europe reduced total gas volumes by about 1%. Earnings from U.S. upstream operations for 2002 were $2,524 million, a decrease of $1,409 million. Excluding the $215 million special charge relating to the
8 U.K. tax rate change reported in 2002, earnings outside the U.S. were $7,289 million, $486 million higher than last year. Downstream earnings decreased substantially from 2001, reflecting significantly lower refining margins in most geographical areas, and further weakness in marketing margins. Improved refining operations and lower operating expenses provided a partial offset to the margin decline. Petroleum product sales of 7,757 kbd decreased 214 kbd from 2001, largely related to reduced refinery runs due to weak margins and lower demand for distillates and aviation fuels. U.S. downstream earnings were $693 million, down $1,231 million. Earnings outside the U.S. of $607 million were $1,696 million lower than last year. Excluding special items of $175 million recorded in 2001, chemicals earnings of $830 million for 2002 were $123 million higher than last year reflecting increased prime product sales across all regions. Record sales volumes of 26,925 kt were 4% above last year's level. Corporate and financing expenses increased $300 million to $442 million, mainly reflecting higher pension expense and lower interest income. The effective tax rate in 2002 was 40%, up 1% from 2001. During 2002, the company continued to benefit from the favorable resolution of tax related issues. During 2002, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 127 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $4,798 million. These purchases were to offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans and programs and to reduce the number of shares outstanding.
9 Estimates of key financial and operating data follow. Financial data, except per share amounts, are expressed in millions of dollars. Consistent with previous practice, the fourth quarter press release includes both net income and earnings excluding merger expenses, discontinued operations and other special items. Earnings that exclude the aforementioned segments are a non-GAAP financial measure and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods. In November 2002, ExxonMobil completed the successful divestment of its copper business in Chile. Earnings associated with the copper business, and the Colombian coal operations which were sold in the first quarter of 2002, are reported as discontinued operations. Power generation activities, primarily in Hong Kong, and remaining U.S. coal operations are now included in the upstream segment. Further details on the reporting realignment are contained in the Form 8-K filed on December 20, 2002 which can be accessed on the ExxonMobil website. ExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters on a webcast at 10 a.m. central time on January 30, 2002.
