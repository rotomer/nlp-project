Exhibit 99.1 News Release ExxonMobil Exxon Mobil Corporation 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard Irving, TX 75039-2298 972 444 1107 Telephone 972 444 1138 Facsimile FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE THURSDAY, MAY 1, 2003 EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES ESTIMATED ___________________________________________ FIRST QUARTER 2003 RESULTS __________________________ IRVING, TX, May 1 -- Exxon Mobil Corporation today reported first quarter results. Net income was $7,040 million ($1.05 per share), an increase of $4,950 million from the first quarter of 2002. Excluding a required accounting change, a special item, merger effects and discontinued operations, first quarter 2003 earnings were $4,790 million ($0.71 per share), an increase of $2,667 million from the first quarter of 2002.
2 Revenue for the first quarter of 2003 totaled $63,780 million compared with $43,393 million in 2002. Capital and exploration expenditures of $3,496 million in the first quarter of 2003 were up $522 million compared with last year. ExxonMobil's Chairman Lee R. Raymond commented as follows: "First quarter earnings were strong and improved in all parts of the business. Capex continued to grow consistent with our long-term investment plans. Asset management steps continued to produce positive results. "Compared with last year's first quarter, ExxonMobil's first quarter 2003 net income of $7,040 million was up $4,950 million. Earnings excluding a required accounting change, a special item, merger effects and discontinued operations were $4,790 million, up $2,667 million. "First quarter net income included a $550 million positive impact from the required adoption of FAS 143 relating to accounting for asset retirement obligations. Net income also included a one-time gain of $1,700 million from the transfer of shares in Ruhrgas AG, a German gas transmission company. The Ruhrgas shares were acquired by E.ON AG in March 2003. "Upstream earnings, excluding the Ruhrgas gain, were a record $3,993 million, an increase of $1,904 million from first quarter 2002 results reflecting higher realizations on sales of crude oil and natural gas. Average crude prices for the quarter were at historical highs reflecting the temporary effects of the national strike in Venezuela and civil unrest in Nigeria as well as market speculation on the impacts from war in Iraq. Natural gas prices were higher primarily due to cold weather in the United States. Both
3 crude and natural gas prices fell during March and are significantly lower thus far in the second quarter. "On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 2% excluding the effects of the national strike in Venezuela, lower entitlements caused by higher prices and changes in OPEC quotas. Actual oil-equivalent production, including these impacts, was flat. Plans for long-term capacity increases remain on track as reflected by higher capital spending. "Downstream earnings were $723 million, an increase of $751 million from last year's very weak first quarter, reflecting improved industry-wide conditions. Refining and marketing margins were higher in most areas worldwide. "Chemicals earnings of $287 million were up $155 million from last year's first quarter. Earnings benefited from record volumes, which were up 4% from last year. Favorable foreign exchange effects and improvements in non-U.S. margins were partly offset by margin declines in the U.S. "Income and other taxes for the first quarter of $18,684 million were up $4,121 million compared to last year. "In the first quarter, ExxonMobil continued its active investment program, spending $3,496 million on capital and exploration projects, compared with $2,974 million last year, reflecting continued growth in upstream spending. "During the quarter, the corporation acquired 35 million shares at a gross cost of $1,191 million to offset the dilution associated with benefit plans and to reduce common stock outstanding."
4 Additional comments on earnings for the major operating segments follow: First Quarter 2003 vs. First Quarter 2002 _________________________________________ Upstream earnings were a record $3,993 million, up $1,904 million from the first quarter 2002 reflecting higher crude oil and natural gas realizations. Oil-equivalent production was up 2% versus the first quarter of last year, excluding the impact of the national strike in Venezuela, lower entitlements caused by higher prices and changes in OPEC quotas. Total actual oil-equivalent production was flat as contributions from new projects and work programs were offset by natural field declines, reduced production in Venezuela and entitlement/quota impacts. Liquids production of 2,506 kbd (thousands of barrels per day) decreased from 2,541 kbd in the first quarter of 2002. Higher production in Nigeria and Canada, and reduced OPEC quota restrictions in Abu Dhabi, were more than offset by supply disruptions in Venezuela, lower entitlements and natural field declines in mature areas. Excluding the strike-related effects in Venezuela and entitlement/quota impacts, liquids production was flat in the first quarter versus last year. First quarter natural gas production increased to 12,048 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), compared with 11,740 mcfd last year. Higher weather- related demand in Europe more than offset natural field decline in mature areas. Earnings from U.S. upstream operations were $1,259 million, up $811 million. Non-U.S. upstream earnings of $2,734 million were $1,093 million higher than last year's first quarter excluding the $1,700 million Ruhrgas gain.
5 Downstream earnings of $723 million, representing about 2 cents per gallon, increased $751 million from the first quarter of last year reflecting the recovery in worldwide refining and marketing margins from very weak conditions. Petroleum product sales were 7,861 kbd, 186 kbd higher than last year's first quarter. U.S. downstream earnings were $174 million, up $160 million due to higher refining and marketing margins. Non-U.S. downstream earnings of $549 million were $591 million higher than last year's first quarter. In addition to margin effects, non-U.S. downstream results benefited from the absence of negative foreign exchange effects in Argentina in the first quarter of 2002. Chemicals earnings of $287 million were up $155 million from the same quarter a year ago due to higher volumes, improved non-U.S. margins and favorable foreign exchange effects. Prime product sales of 7,000 kt (thousands of metric tons) were up 280 kt, reflecting higher demand in key commodity businesses across most regions. Corporate and financing expenses of $213 million increased $143 million mainly due to higher U.S. pension costs. During the first quarter of 2003, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 35 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1,191 million. These purchases were to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to reduce the number of shares outstanding. Shares outstanding were reduced from 6,700 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2002 to 6,679 million at the end of the first quarter. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be discontinued at any time.

Actual results, including production growth and capital spending, could differ materially due to changes in market conditions affecting the oil and gas industry; political events or disturbances; changes in OPEC quotas; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors including those discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on our website and in Item 1 of ExxonMobil's 2002 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date. Consistent with previous practice, the first quarter press release includes both net income and earnings excluding a required accounting change, a special item, merger expenses and discontinued operations. Earnings that exclude the aforementioned segments are a non-GAAP financial measure and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods. A reconciliation to net income is shown in Attachment II. Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures is contained on pages 26 and 27 in the 2002 Form 10-K and is also available through our website at www.exxonmobil.com.
