Exhibit 99.1 News Release ExxonMobil Exxon Mobil Corporation 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard Irving, TX 75039-2298 972 444 1107 Telephone 972 444 1138 Facsimile FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE THURSDAY, July 31, 2003 EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES ESTIMATED ___________________________________________ SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS ___________________________ IRVING, TX, July 31 -- Exxon Mobil Corporation today reported second quarter results. Net income was $4,170 million ($0.62 per share), an increase of $1,530 million from the second quarter of 2002. Excluding merger effects and discontinued operations, earnings increased $1,511 million from the second quarter of 2002.
2 Revenue for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $57,165 million compared with $50,804 million in 2002. Capital and exploration expenditures of $3,831 million in the second quarter of 2003 were up $438 million compared with last year. ExxonMobil's Chairman Lee R. Raymond commented as follows: "Second quarter earnings remained strong and improved in all parts of the business versus last year. Chemicals earnings were at their highest level since 1998. Capex continued to grow consistent with our long-term investment plans. "Compared with last year's second quarter, ExxonMobil's net income of $4,170 million was up $1,530 million. "Upstream earnings were $2,838 million, an increase of $608 million from second quarter 2002 results reflecting higher average crude and natural gas prices. "On an oil-equivalent basis, actual production in the second quarter was flat with increased European gas demand and contributions from new projects offset by natural field decline and the impacts of operational outages in the North Sea and West Africa. The majority of the operational problems were resolved by the end of the second quarter. "Excluding the impacts of the national strike in Venezuela and the second quarter operational outages, total oil and natural gas producible volumes increased 2% versus the first half of last year. Plans for long-term capacity increases remain on track as reflected by higher capital spending.
3 "Downstream earnings were $1,146 million, an increase of $764 million from last year's second quarter reflecting improved industry-wide conditions. Margins were particularly strong at the beginning of the quarter but have since weakened significantly. "Chemicals earnings of $439 million, were up $170 million from last year's second quarter. Earnings benefited from higher worldwide margins early in the quarter and favorable foreign exchange effects. "ExxonMobil's net income for the first half of 2003 was $11,210 million, up $6,480 million from the first half of 2002 reflecting improved results in all areas of the business. "In the second quarter, ExxonMobil continued its active investment program, spending $3,831 million on capital and exploration projects, compared with $3,393 million last year, reflecting continued growth in upstream spending. "During the quarter, the corporation acquired 33 million shares at a gross cost of $1,194 million to offset the dilution associated with benefit plans and to reduce common stock outstanding. Due to the strong earnings through the first half of the year and the resulting significant cash flow, the corporation has increased its rate of share purchases in July." Additional comments on earnings for the major operating segments follow: Second Quarter 2003 vs. Second Quarter 2002 ___________________________________________ Upstream earnings were $2,838 million, up $608 million from the second quarter 2002 reflecting higher crude oil and natural gas realizations.
4 Oil-equivalent production was flat versus the second quarter of last year. Higher European gas demand and contributions from new projects and work programs were offset by natural field declines and operational issues in the North Sea and West Africa. Operational problems were largely resolved by the end of the quarter. Liquids production of 2,478 kbd (thousands of barrels per day) decreased from 2,495 kbd in the second quarter of 2002. Higher production in Nigeria and Canada, and reduced OPEC quota restrictions in Abu Dhabi, were more than offset by natural field declines in mature areas and by the operational outages in the North Sea and West Africa. Second quarter natural gas production increased to 9,259 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), compared with 9,192 mcfd last year. Higher demand in Europe and contributions from new projects and work programs more than offset natural field decline in mature areas and the impacts of operational problems in the North Sea. Earnings from U.S. upstream operations were $907 million, up $230 million. Non-U.S. upstream earnings of $1,931 million were $378 million higher than last year's second quarter. Downstream earnings of $1,146 million increased $764 million from the second quarter of last year reflecting stronger worldwide refining and marketing margins. Petroleum product sales were 7,800 kbd, 231 kbd higher than last year's second quarter.
5 U.S. downstream earnings were $419 million, up $185 million. Non-U.S. downstream earnings of $727 million were $579 million higher than last year's second quarter. Chemicals earnings of $439 million were up $170 million from the same quarter a year ago due to improved margins during the first part of the period and favorable foreign exchange effects. Prime product sales of 6,369 kt (thousands of metric tons) were down 333 kt, reflecting lower industry demand. Corporate and financing expenses of $253 million increased by $31 million mainly due to higher U.S. pension costs. During the second quarter of 2003, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 33 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1,194 million. In addition, from July 1 through July 30, the corporation purchased 14 million shares for the treasury at a gross cost of $513 million. These purchases were to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to reduce the number of shares outstanding. Shares outstanding were reduced from 6,679 million at the end of the first quarter of 2003 to 6,652 million at the end of the second quarter. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions. Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. First Half 2003 vs. First Half 2002 ___________________________________ Net income of $11,210 million ($1.67 per share) for the first half of 2003 increased $6,480 million from the first half of 2002. Excluding a required accounting change, a special item, merger effects and discontinued operations, first half 2003
6 earnings of $8,960 million ($1.33 per share) were $4,178 million higher than 2002. Net income for the first half 2003 included a $550 million positive impact for the required adoption of FAS 143 relating to accounting for asset retirement obligations. First half net income in 2003 also included a one-time gain of $1,700 million from the transfer of shares in Ruhrgas AG, a German gas transmission company. First half net income in 2002 included $90 million of after-tax merger expenses and $38 million in earnings from discontinued operations. Upstream earnings, excluding the Ruhrgas gain, of $6,831 million increased $2,512 million due to higher liquids and natural gas realizations. Total oil and natural gas producible volumes increased 2% versus the first half of last year as higher European gas demand and contributions from new projects and work programs more than offset natural field decline. Taking into account the effects of the national strike in Venezuela, and the operational outages in the second quarter, actual oil-equivalent production was flat. Liquids production of 2,491 kbd decreased 27 kbd from 2002. Higher production in Nigeria and Canada, and lower OPEC-driven quota constraints, were offset by natural field decline and the impact of operational problems in the North Sea and West Africa. First half 2003 natural gas production of 10,652 mcfd increased 193 mcfd from 2002. Higher demand in Europe and contributions from new projects and work programs more than offset natural field decline and the operational outages in the North Sea.
7 Earnings from U.S. upstream operations for the first half of 2003 were $2,166 million, an increase of $1,041 million. Earnings outside the U.S. were $4,665 million, $1,471 million higher than last year. Downstream earnings of $1,869 million increased by $1,515 million from a weak first half of 2002 reflecting higher worldwide refining and marketing margins. Petroleum product sales of 7,830 kbd compared with 7,622 kbd in the first half of 2002. U.S. downstream earnings were $593 million, up $345 million. Non-U.S. downstream earnings of $1,276 million were $1,170 million higher than last year. Chemicals earnings of $726 million were up $325 million from the first half of 2002 due to improved margins and favorable foreign exchange effects. Prime product sales of 13,260 kt were down 76 kt, reflecting lower demand. Corporate and financing expenses of $466 million increased by $174 million mainly due to higher U.S. pension costs. During the first half of 2003, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 68 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $2,385 million. These purchases were to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to reduce the number of shares outstanding. Estimates of key financial and operating data follow. Financial data, except per share amounts, are expressed in millions of dollars.

Actual results, including production and capacity growth and capital spending, could differ materially due to changes in market conditions affecting the oil and gas industry; political events or disturbances; changes in OPEC quotas; changes in technical or operating conditions or rates of natural field decline; and other factors including those discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on our website and in Item 1 of ExxonMobil's 2002 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date. Consistent with previous practice, the second quarter press release includes both net income and earnings excluding a required accounting change, a special item, merger expenses and discontinued operations. Earnings that exclude the aforementioned items are a non-GAAP financial measure and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods. A reconciliation to net income is shown in Attachment II.
