On November 14, 2003, a state district court jury in Montgomery, Alabama returned a verdict against Exxon Mobil Corporation in a case involving the interpretation of the royalty provisions in state leases in Mobile Bay.  The verdict included $63.5 million in compensatory damages and $11.8 billion in punitive damages on a finding that ExxonMobil had committed fraud.  ExxonMobil believes the verdict is not justified by the evidence and that the amount of the award is grossly excessive and unconstitutional.  ExxonMobil will appeal the decision.
