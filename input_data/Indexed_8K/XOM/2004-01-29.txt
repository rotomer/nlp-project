On January 28, 2004, the United States District Court for the District of Alaska revised the punitive damages awarded in connection with the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident from $4 billion to $4.5 billion plus interest.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has twice vacated the punitive damage awards entered by the District Court. On November 7, 2001, the Ninth Circuit vacated the original punitive damage award of $5 billion entered by the District Court after trial in 1996 as being excessive under the Constitution and remanded the case to the District Court for it to determine the amount of the punitive damage award consistent with the Ninth Circuit's holding.  On December 6, 2002, the District Court reduced the punitive damages award from $5 billion to $4 billion.  Both ExxonMobil and the plaintiffs appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit, which vacated the judgment on August 18, 2003, and ordered the District Court to reconsider in light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in .
