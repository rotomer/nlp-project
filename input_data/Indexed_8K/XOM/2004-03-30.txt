On March 29, 2004, the Circuit Court in Montgomery, Alabama reduced an $11.8 billion punitive damages award, returned in a state district court verdict on November 14, 2003 against ExxonMobil Corporation, to $3.5 billion. The original verdict also included $63.5 million in compensatory damages. ExxonMobil believes the current ruling is not justified by the evidence and that the amount is grossly excessive and unconstitutional. ExxonMobil will appeal the decision.
