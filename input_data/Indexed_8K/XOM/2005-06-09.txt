Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Under the registrant's Short-Term Incentive Program and 2003 Incentive Program, as well as prior incentive plans and programs of Exxon Corporation and Mobil Corporation, certain bonuses and other incentive awards were originally granted under terms providing for settlement of the award to be deferred in one or more installments of cash or shares.  In light of recent tax law changes and for the purpose of achieving consistent treatment of all grantees (whether their awards were originally granted by Exxon, Mobil, or ExxonMobil), on June 3, 2005, the registrant's Compensation Committee determined that all outstanding deferred incentive awards would become payable together with accumulated interest or dividend equivalents in a single installment on August 1, 2005.  This change affects approximately 180 holders of deferred awards, including active employees and retirees, of whom six grantees are current executive offic ers of the registrant.  The total value of deferred compensation to become payable on August 1 is currently estimated to be approximately $69 million, of which approximately $9 million is estimated to be payable to current executive officers.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
