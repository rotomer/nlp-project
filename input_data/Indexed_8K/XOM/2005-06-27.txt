FAIRFAX, VA, June 24 -- In light of the Supreme Court's 5 to 4 decision Thursday to grant a lower Federal court the right to hear the claims of several thousand Exxon service station dealers who challenged a discount for cash program, Exxon Mobil Corporation announced today that it has determined to take an after-tax charge of $200 million which will be reflected in the Corporation's second quarter results.  This charge is in addition to an after-tax charge of $550 million that ExxonMobil took in the third quarter of 2004.
