Mr. Lee R. Raymond, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation, has announced his intention to retire at the end of 2005.
It is anticipated that the board of directors will elect Mr. Rex W. Tillerson, currently president and a director of the registrant, to succeed Mr. Raymond as chairman of the board and chief executive officer effective upon Mr. Raymond's retirement.
As noted in the registrant's most recent proxy statement dated April 13, 2005, the registrant's Compensation Committee believes that all executives should be "at will" employees of the company.  Accordingly, senior executives do not have employment contracts.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
