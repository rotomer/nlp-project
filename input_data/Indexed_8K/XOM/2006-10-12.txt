Exhibit No.
Description
10(iii)(c.1)
ExxonMobil Supplemental Savings Plan.
10(iii)(c.2)
ExxonMobil Supplemental Pension Plan.
10(iii)(c.3)
ExxonMobil Additional Payments Plan.

Exhibit 10(iii)(c.1)
The purpose of this Plan is to provide a payment of approximately equivalent value from the general assets of Exxon Mobil Corporation ("Corporation") to a person participating in the ExxonMobil Savings Plan ("Savings Plan") who, because of the application of United States Internal Revenue Code ("Code") sections 415 and 401(a)(17) is precluded from receiving employer contributions to the person's Savings Plan account to which the person would otherwise be entitled.
2.1
Benefit Formula
As to any specific Savings Plan participant the total amount of payment under this Plan is an amount that is in general determined by notionally crediting on a monthly basis the amount of employer contributions that cannot be made to the Savings Plan for that person as a result of application to that person of Code sections 415 and 401(a)(17); except that, for those persons who, as of December 31, 1993, are classified at level 36 and are age 50 and above, only notional employer contributions made after such date are taken into account.  This amount is enhanced in each instance by the Citibank Prime Lending Rate as of the last business day of each calendar quarter, and is then reduced, but not below zero, by the amount, if any, of the actuarial lump-sum value of the amount payable to the participant under the ExxonMobil Key Employee Additional Payments Plan that is not applied as an offset against the participan t's benefit under the ExxonMobil Additional Payments Plan or the ExxonMobil Supplemental Pension Plan.  For this purpose, the actuarial lump-sum value shall be determined using the mortality and interest rate assumptions set out in the ExxonMobil Pension Accounts Instrument.
2.2
Calculation Methodology
The exact methodology used in determining such monthly credits and interest thereon will be established from time to time by the Plan Administrator.  General guidelines to be followed are:
(A)
Required Participant Contributions
To the extent determined by those administering this Plan, a person is required to make regular employee contributions to the person's Savings Plan account up to the maximum permitted by the Code to receive credits under this Plan.
(B)
Discretionary Employee Contributions
Prior to July 1, 2002, a person may not enhance the amounts credited under this Plan by making discretionary employee contributions to the person's Savings Plan account.
(C)
Additional Contributions under Stock Match Account
No amount is credited under this Plan because of a person's inability to obtain the enhanced portion of the employer match for employer matches directed to the Stock Match Account in the Savings Plan.
Payment of the benefit determined under article 2 above shall be made in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the latest of the following times:
(A)
the person's termination of employment or retirement from ExxonMobil;
(B)
in the case of a person who, immediately prior to his or her termination or retirement, has a Classification Level of 37 or above ("Key Employee"), the six-month anniversary of the person's termination of employment or retirement; or
(C)
In the case of a participant whose Savings Plan account is transferred to a savings plan sponsored by Infineum USA Inc. or any of its affiliates ("Infineum"), the participant's termination of employment from Infineum.
4.1

Exhibit 10(iii)(c.2)
The purpose of this Plan is to provide payments of equivalent value from the general assets of Exxon Mobil Corporation ("Corporation") to those participants in the ExxonMobil Pension Plan ("Pension Plan") who, because of the application of United States Internal Revenue Code ("Code") sections 415 and 401(a)(17), are precluded from receiving from Pension Plan funded assets all the payments to which they would otherwise be entitled under the Pension Plan's formula.  
2.1
Benefit Formula
(A)
In General
Except as provided in paragraph (B) below with respect to former Mobil employees, as defined in the ExxonMobil Common Provisions, ("Former Mobil Employees"), as to any Pension Plan participant eligible for payment under this Plan, the value of the payments under this Plan is an amount that when added to the normal form amount that can be paid to the participant from the Pension Plan's qualified funded assets, produces a sum equal to the total normal form amount to which the participant would be entitled computed under the Pension Plan formula applicable to that participant disregarding any reductions, restrictions, or limitations brought about by the application of Code sections 415 and 401(a)(17), reduced, but not below zero, by the following amounts:
(1)
the amount, if any, payable to the participant under the ExxonMobil Key Employee Supplemental Pension Plan, and
(2)
the amount, if any, payable to the participant under the ExxonMobil Key Employee Additional Payments Plan that is not applied as an offset against the participant's benefit under the ExxonMobil Additional Payments Plan.
Where relevant, this computation is performed after taking into account any entitlement the participant may have under the Overseas Contributory Annuity Plan.  The resulting benefit is expressed in the form of a monthly five-year-certain and life annuity for the life of the participant commencing at the participant's age 65 ("Normal Retirement Age").
(B)
Benefit Formula for Former Mobil Employee
The payments under this Plan for Former Mobil Employees who retire with eligibility for Incentive Pension Benefits under the ExxonMobil Additional Payments Plan shall be the amounts determined under paragraph (1) below and, if applicable, paragraph (2) below.

In General
The amount benefit determined under this paragraph (1) shall be the lesser of:
(a)
the amount of the person's benefit otherwise determined under paragraph (A) above, or
(b)
the excess if any of the person's Overall Benefit Objective as described in section 2.3(B) of the ExxonMobil Additional Payments Plan, over the sum of the person's benefit under the ExxonMobil Pension Plan (including any Pre-Social Security Benefit) and the person's Incentive Pension Benefit and Nonqualified PSSP Benefit, if any, as determined under the ExxonMobil Additional Payments Plan,
expressed in the form of a monthly five-year-certain and life annuity for the life of the participant commencing at the participant's Normal Retirement Age.
(2)
Nonqualified PSSP Benefits
The amount of a person's benefit determined under this paragraph (2) shall be the amount, if any, of any Nonqualified PSSP Benefit determined for such person under the terms of the ExxonMobil Additional Payments Plan.
2.2
Offsets for Other Pension Benefits
A person's benefit determined under section 2.1 shall be offset, but not below zero, by any benefit payable to the person under (A) an offsetting pension that is not qualified under the terms of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, (B) a separation payment offset, or (C) a non-U.S. governmental pension offset, as such terms are defined under the ExxonMobil Pension Plan.

Exhibit 10(iii)(c.3)
The purpose of this Plan is to provide additional payments from the general assets of Exxon Mobil Corporation (the "Corporation") to certain persons.  The benefits payable under this Plan consist of two types of pension benefits and a disability benefit.  The first pension benefit is a benefit based upon the person's final average incentive compensation ("Incentive Pension Benefit").  The second pension benefit restores certain benefits that are accrued under a pension plan sponsored by a non-U.S. affiliate of the Corporation but which are not paid ("Overseas Makeup Benefit").  The disability benefit is based on incentive compensation and is paid in the event of a long-term disability ("Disability Benefit").
2.1
Eligibility
A person is eligible to receive Incentive Pension Benefits only if the person satisfies at either of the following requirements:
(A)
the person becomes a retiree within the meaning of the ExxonMobil Common Provisions ("retiree"); or
(B)
in the case of an individual who after terminating employment from the Corporation or any of its affiliates continues employment with Infineum USA Inc. or one of its affiliates (collectively, "Infineum"), becomes a qualified plans retiree within the meaning of the ExxonMobil Common Provisions ("qualified plans retiree").
2.2
Benefit Formula
(A)
in General
Except as provided in section 2.3 below with respect to former Mobil employees, as defined in the ExxonMobil Common Provisions ("Former Mobil Employees"), the amount of a person's Incentive Pension Benefit is determined by multiplying 1.6% of the person's final average incentive compensation by the person's years of pensionable service as determined under the ExxonMobil Pension Plan (reduced, but not below zero, by the equivalent amount, if any, determined with respect to the person under the ExxonMobil Key Employee Additional Payments Plan), and dividing the amount so derived by twelve.  The amount so derived is expressed in the form of a monthly five-year certain and life annuity for the life of the person commencing at the person's age 65 ("Normal Retirement Age").

Calculation
(a)
In General
If a person's eligibility for Incentive Pension Benefits arises from section 2.1(A) above, the person's final average incentive compensation is the average of the person's three highest annual bonus awards (including awards of zero, if any) under the Corporation's Incentive Programs awarded on any of the five most recent annual award dates immediately preceding the person's termination of employment.

its affiliates in connection with a corporate acquisition, incentive compensation paid by the person's former employer that is the equivalent of bonus awards payable under the Corporation's Incentive Program may be taken into account as determined by the management of the Corporation in its sole discretion.  Management shall have the discretion to exclude any and all prior employer compensation for purposes of this paragraph (b).
(2)
Infineum Participants
If a person's eligibility for Incentive Pension Benefits arises from Section 2.1(B) above, the person's final average incentive compensation is the sum of the three highest annual bonus awards under the Corporation's Incentive Programs, if any, during the five-year period immediately prior to the person's termination of employment from Infineum, divided by three.
(3)
Annual Bonus Award
(a)
Items Used in Calculation

(c)
Calculation of Annual Bonus Award
If an annual bonus award is granted as bonus units, the maximum settlement value obtainable at the time of the grant shall be used in calculating the value of the award.

2.4
Offset for Similar Benefits
If a participant under this Plan is also entitled to payments comparable to the Incentive Pension Benefit for any portion of the same years of pensionable service under a plan of a service-oriented employer, as defined in the ExxonMobil Common Provisions, other than the Corporation, the amount of the Incentive Pension Benefit is reduced by the respective amount of such comparable payments.

4.4
Adjustment for Key Employees
If payment of a Key Employee's Incentive Pension Benefit and/or Overseas Makeup Benefit is delayed for six months following retirement because of the requirement set out in section 4.1(A)(2) above, then instead of the lump-sum benefit calculated under section 4.3 above, the person shall receive a lump-sum benefit equal to the greater of the following:
(A)
The lump-sum payment that would otherwise have been calculated for the person under section 4.3 above as if he were not a Key Employee, based on the payment date that would have applied to the individual if he were not a Key employee and on the actuarial factors applicable as of such date under the ExxonMobil Pension Plan, plus interest for the period of delayed payment; or
(B)
A lump-sum that is the actuarial equivalent of the person's five-year-certain and life annuity calculated as of the delayed payment date and using the actuarial factors applicable as of such date under the ExxonMobil Pension Plan.

6.1
Nature of Disability Benefits
The benefits provided under this article 6 ("Disability Benefits") are in the nature of long-term disability benefits, payable on account of and for the duration of a person's incapacity on account of disability.  These Disability Benefits are intended to qualify as employee welfare benefits under ERISA and as "disability pay" under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and its supporting regulations, thereby being exempt from the scope and application of section 409A.
6.2
Payment of Disability Benefit
If a person who becomes a retiree also becomes entitled to long-term disability benefits under the ExxonMobil Disability Plan, the person shall receive monthly Disability Benefits under this Plan.  Such Disability Benefits shall commence at the time the person commences long-term disability benefits under the ExxonMobil Disability Plan and shall continue as long as entitlement to long-term disability or transition benefits under such plan continues.  
6.3
Benefit Formula
(A)
In General
The amount of each monthly Disability Benefit payable to a person is determined by dividing one-half of the person's final average incentive compensation, determined under section 2.2(B) above, by 12 and deducting therefrom the offset described in paragraph (B) below.
(B)
Offset
Commencing with the month in which a person's Incentive Pension Benefit is paid, the amount of the person's monthly Disability Benefit shall be reduced by the monthly amount of the person's Incentive Pension Benefit and/or Overseas Makeup Benefit (expressed as a five-year-certain and life annuity).  In the case of a Key Employee, the offset provided under this paragraph (B) shall be applied beginning with the month his or her Incentive Pension Benefit would have been paid if he or she were not a Key Employee.
6.4
Offset for Similar Benefit
If a person receiving Disability Benefits hereunder is also entitled to comparable payments under a plan of a service-oriented employer (as defined in the ExxonMobil Common Provisions) other than the Corporation under circumstances where the Plan Administrator determines that such benefits are duplicative of the Disability Benefits payable hereunder, then such Disability Benefits shall be reduced by the amount of such comparable payment.  In any given case, the Plan Administrator may determine the precise amount of this
offset and if a conversion of currency computation is required, may follow the process established under the ExxonMobil Pension Plan.
6.5
Disability Death Benefit
(A)
Death During Employment
If a person dies as an active employee with 15 or more years of Benefit Plan Service, as determined under the ExxonMobil Common Provisions, then the person's beneficiary (as determined under section 5.2 above) shall receive a disability death benefit equal to the present value of 60 monthly installments of the person's Disability Benefit, calculated as if the person had become eligible for Disability Benefit payments on the day prior to death.  For purposes of this paragraph (A), the value of the person's Disability Benefit installments shall be determined by applying the offset under section 6.3(B) above as if the person's Incentive Pension Benefit and/or Overseas Makeup Benefit were payable at the time of death.
(B)
Death After Commencement of Disability Retirement Payments
If a person dies while receiving Disability Benefits under this article 6 but before the receipt of 60 monthly installments, the person's beneficiary (as determined under section 5.2 above) shall receive the lump-sum equivalent value of the remaining 60 monthly installments.  If at the time of death the person's Incentive Pension Benefit had not been paid, then the value of the person's remaining Disability Benefit installments shall be determined by applying the offset under section 6.3(B) above as if the person's Incentive Pension Benefit and/or Overseas Makeup Benefit were paid at the time of death.
