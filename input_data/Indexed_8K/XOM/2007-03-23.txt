ExxonMobil's Core Objective  Long-Term Growth in Shareholder Value
Over the past five years, ExxonMobil has distributed over $92 billion to shareholders including $34 billion through dividend payments and $58 billion via share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. In 2006 we distributed $25 billion to reduce shares outstanding and almost $8 billion in dividend payments.
The Corporation has paid a dividend every year for over a century and has increased its annual dividend every year since 1983. Since the beginning of 2002, quarterly dividends have grown 39 percent from $0.23 to $0.32 per share.
ExxonMobil has used its flexible share purchase program to reduce the number of shares outstanding by 16 percent since the beginning of 2002. Reducing shares outstanding increases the ownership percentage of the company that each remaining share represents and contributes to increased earnings and cash flow per share.

Energy Outlook  A View to 2030
At ExxonMobil, our greatest challenge lies in helping meet the world's rising energy needs.
The Energy Outlook summarizes our view of the fundamentals that underpin world energy supply and demand through 2030. It provides a strategic foundation, aiding our evaluation and selection of business opportunities that hold the most promise. We continuously update our outlook to ensure that new technologies and information are considered in addition to past experience.
GROWING POPULATIONS AND IMPROVING LIVING STANDARDS
Progress for billions of people around the world is driving a growing need for reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy. We are working to help meet this need.
OECD  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
We project the global population of 6.5 billion people today will grow to 8 billion by 2030. Close to 95 percent of this growth will occur in developing countries, where securing energy to support basic living standards is often difficult.
For progress to occur, access to modern energy supplies and technologies is critical. This requires disciplined investments in energy as well as basic infrastructure. At the same time, continuing to develop and adopt efficient energy practices and technologies is important and prudent.
We expect the global economy will approximately double by 2030, driven by the non-OECD nations including the rapidly expanding economies of China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia. The strong economic growth in the developing countries, along with significant population growth, will drive global energy demand and trade patterns.
DEMAND FOR LIQUIDS
As the world's population grows, and as incomes increase, so does the global demand for liquid energy supplies (e.g., oil, biofuels). This demand growth is driven primarily by the transportation sector, reflecting the unique advantages of liquid fuels for those applications. Even with anticipated efficiency increases, demand will increase at a rate of 1.4 percent per year.
Total transportation demand in 2030 will be about 50 percent higher than today. This includes light-duty vehicles (cars, SUVs) and heavy-duty vehicles (trucks, buses), along with aviation, marine, and rail. Light- and heavy-duty vehicles will represent the majority of this demand.
A key factor driving demand is the growth in ownership of personal vehicles. This is most evident with the emergence of rapidly expanding non-OECD economies, which we expect will approach half a billion personal vehicles by 2030.
Working to offset demand growth will be continuing improvements in conventional engines and deployment of emerging technologies, such as hybrid vehicles. These advances should enable significant gains in vehicle fuel economy.
Technology has reached the point where liquid fuels can be derived from coal, natural gas, and crops. But even under the most optimistic scenarios, these alternatives will supply only a small fraction of the fuel needed on a global basis. Oil is the world's transportation fuel of choice, and will remain so for decades.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
OIL SUPPLY
By 2030, we expect total liquids demand to be about 115 million barrels per day. The world is endowed with huge oil resources (see sidebar), which are adequate to meet rising demand through 2030. However, access to these resources, huge investments, and the ongoing development and application of technology are essential to developing new supplies.
Technology advances are critical to increasing future oil supplies by enabling more effective resource recovery while minimizing costs and environmental effects. Gains continue in the areas of advanced reservoir imaging, extended-reach drilling, fast drill processes, and enhanced recovery technologies.
Emerging technologies promise to further advance our capability to extend recoverable resources worldwide. New technology will promote economic development of frontier resources such as heavy oil and shale oil to help ensure adequate supplies well past 2030.
THE NEED FOR POWER
Economic growth and improvements in living standards are reflected in the demand for electricity. Those across the world without access to reliable electricity lack a basic ingredient that would allow them to not only improve their lives, but also compete in today's global economy.
A variety of fuel sources exist for generating power  e.g., coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar. Which power generation sources are used will be a function of cost and scale, as well as resource availability.
In developed economies, natural gas will be the primary fuel source for growth in power generation. These countries have access to gas supplies and an existing infrastructure. At the same time, gas has the advantage of higher-efficiency combined-cycle plants and low emissions versus other fuels.
Emerging economies will generally continue to prefer coal. This is especially true in China and India, where coal is abundant, provides supply security, and offers the lowest-cost option for huge populations with surging demand for electricity.
While natural gas and coal demand will grow the most in absolute terms, nuclear and renewable fuels will also see significant growth.
GLOBAL ENERGY IN PERSPECTIVE
Our outlook indicates that overall global energy demand will grow about 1.6 percent annually to 2030.
As has been the case for the past century, the majority of this need will be met by fossil fuels. We expect oil, gas, and coal will remain about 80 percent of global energy in 2030.
Liquids comprise the largest share and are expected to grow about 1.4 percent per year. Most of this demand will be met by crude oil and condensate. Biofuels will also contribute, but even with aggressive growth assumptions, biofuels will reach only about 1 percent of total energy by 2030.
Driven largely by increasing demand for electricity, we expect natural gas demand to grow about 1.7 percent and coal by about 1.6 percent annually.
"Other" energy includes a variety of fuel types that in total will grow about 1.5 percent annually. Biomass  primarily wood and dung  is the largest component and is likely to grow about 1 percent per year. Nuclear is expected to grow on average about 1.4 percent annually, led by Asia Pacific. Hydroelectric growth of about 2 percent per year is also centered in Asia Pacific. We expect wind and solar combined to grow about 10 percent per year, supported by subsidies and mandates. At this high growth rate, wind and solar will reach about 1 percent of total energy in 2030.

EMISSIONS
As the world's energy consumption continues to grow, we must be mindful of the implications.
First, large timely investments are necessary to develop the resources required to meet the world's energy needs. These investments can be made only if industry is allowed access to the resources.
Second, continuing development and application of technology is essential, both in stretching supplies and dampening demand increases.
Third, rising consumption of oil, gas, and coal means that CO emissions will also increase. Rising CO emissions pose risks for society and ecosystems, which could prove to be significant. Therefore, it is wise to identify the best options to mitigate global CO emissions.
2
2
2
In weighing mitigation options, scale and cost are critical elements. While all areas bear scrutiny, the most significant opportunities and the lowest cost options to reduce CO emissions are likely to be in the power generation sector, where emissions are associated with large plants.
2
Another area of focus is the transport sector, where CO emissions are generated by huge numbers of dispersed sources (e.g., cars, trucks). This is a smaller target than power generation and presents more expensive alternatives.
2
Clearly a variety of options exist to mitigate CO emissions, but they each come at a cost, ultimately borne by consumers. Effectively addressing this issue requires understanding the potential scale, cost, and tradeoffs involved.
2
CONCLUSIONS
Key conclusions of our outlook include:
Our outlook is focused on the world's rising energy needs and how we expect these needs to be met, considering scale and cost issues.
Providing this energy is not easy or automatic. The challenges reflect the global magnitude of the task, as well as often competing objectives related to economic development, energy security, and the environment.
Our approach is to address global energy challenges in a pragmatic fashion, recognizing that proposed solutions that are not feasible on a broad-based, commercial scale are not solutions at all.
With our leading resource base, financial and technological strength, disciplined investment approach, and project portfolio, we are well-positioned to help meet the global needs for substantial new energy supplies. These assets provide us with a sustainable competitive advantage and help us remain at the forefront in meeting the energy challenges and capitalizing on the opportunities ahead.

Optimum Drilling and Completions
The need to drill and complete more challenging wells has led ExxonMobil to develop differentiating technology based on improved knowledge of physics limits in drilling and completion processes. This knowledge has been built into proprietary drilling software, called , and is used to create optimal drilling designs. A physics-limit approach is also used in ExxonMobil's Fast Drill Process (FDP), which has resulted in rate-of-penetration improvement of up to 100 percent. The combined result of using software and the FDP is an unparalleled ability to drill complex wells at lower costs. In addition, knowing the physics limits for well completions has extended well operability guidelines and led to development of patented completion equipment and techniques. As a result, in West Africa deepwater completions, ExxonMobil's technology has yielded 18-percent cost savings while increasing initial well flow efficiencies 75 percent over the industry average using conventional methods. Our worldwide record of no deepwater well completion failures in the last five years is unmatched in industry

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
Enhanced Oil Recovery
ExxonMobil's leading position in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) stems from its extensive R&D commitment, operational capabilities, and worldwide field experience. For the last 35 years, we have maintained one of the largest EOR research programs in the industry, developing new gas injection, chemical, and thermal recovery methods. ExxonMobil's proven approach is to integrate research on fundamental recovery processes with special laboratory measurements and simulation studies to design, pilot test, and conduct commercial projects. The development and application of recovery processes that are tailored to the reservoir allow full recovery potential to be realized. This successful approach has led to our current involvement in one-third of the world's gas injection EOR production and our operation of the world's largest thermal bitumen recovery project.
Advanced Reservoir Simulation
ExxonMobil continues to develop and add advanced capabilities to its next-generation reservoir simulator, to maintain its industry-leading position in reservoir flow modeling. In particular, we have improved the accuracy of reservoir simulation for heavy oil assets with the addition of several new thermal modeling features. These capabilities represent more fully the physical and chemical processes involved in thermal simulation and heavy oil recovery, thereby allowing better depletion planning and improved recovery. Continued commitment to major enhancements to the simulator ensures that ExxonMobil will maintain a superior simulation capability to support its investment decisions.

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY
Our development and utilization of technology in the Downstream and Chemical businesses provides a competitive advantage. ExxonMobil scientists and engineers utilize the most advanced equipment and techniques to conduct research that delivers process and product improvements. Each year we invest millions of dollars in laboratory and computing tools to grow our technical capabilities, develop our people, and enable our researchers to obtain faster and more precise and accurate results.
To ensure steady delivery of new technology, we manage our research and development portfolio as a technology pipeline consisting of three sections:
, in which a new idea is born and tested; , in which the technology is advanced into technical readiness; and , in which the technology is brought to commercial manufacturing or the market.
Discovery
Development
Deployment
In 2006 we had over 200 programs in various stages of technology development. Each is fully aligned with one or more of our strategic business initiatives: lower cost processes, advantaged feeds, and higher-value products.
Lower- Cost Processes
Our Downstream and Chemical manufacturing facilities strive to lower processing costs by delivering improved efficiency, greater reliability, and better asset utilization.
Discovery of new, improved catalysts  substances that accelerate chemical reactions without themselves being consumed  is one way to lower processing costs. ExxonMobil is a recognized leader in zeolite synthesis and hydroprocessing catalysis, and we continue to develop and deploy new technology in these areas.
For example, over the past several years, our investment in technology provided us with a competitive advantage in meeting new, more stringent sulfur specifications in gasoline and diesel. We have commissioned numerous units to produce low-sulfur gasoline, and have successfully licensed this technology. We have also commissioned more than 10 new or upgraded hydrotreating units for ultra-low sulfur diesel production. To keep this technology pipeline full, we continually search for new and improved catalysts. Our new capabilities in high throughput experimentation have identified several next generation catalysts with potential for step-out improvements in the efficient production of low-sulfur fuels.
SCANfining
The commercialization of the new technology in 2006 is another example of successful low-cost process technology development. The technology enables more effective removal of olefins from aromatics streams and can offer significant benefits in terms of operating and capital costs, solid waste reduction, and operations improvement. The catalyst also provides improved environmental performance as it is regenerable, unlike the traditional clay it replaces.

Advantaged Feeds
Developing new technology to process challenging feeds provides greater flexibility in meeting marketing demands and lowering raw material costs. In this area, our Molecule Management program continues to yield tremendous benefits.
One of the core components is our ability to characterize  at the molecular level  feed and product streams. In 2006 we further advanced our analytical capabilities for identifying the heaviest molecules in crudes and refinery streams. This information is combined with sophisticated modeling and other tools to optimize crude slates, process-unit conditions, and product distributions, thereby enabling greater quantities of higher-value products to be extracted from cheaper feedstocks.
Similarly, we continue to work on new hydroprocessing technology to upgrade the "bottom of the barrel" to higher-value chemical feeds. An added benefit is that by enabling our refineries and chemical plants to process heavier and more challenging feeds, we increase our supply reliability, as reflected in the continued increase in the number of crudes and feed streams our facilities can handle.
Higher-Value Products
Technology also plays an important role in developing new products of benefit to consumers, such as advanced lubricants or polymers with superior properties.
In the lubricants area, we have developed a premium, heavy-duty diesel engine oil product line to meet the new stringent emission control regulations. The oils protect the engines through superior viscosity control, reduced deposit formation, and increased wear protection, while meeting strict chemical limits to protect sensitive emissions control equipment. ExxonMobil's engine oils were one of the first oils on the market and provide customers with an excellent solution for maintaining engine cleanliness and performance.
Delvac 1300 Super
In 2006 ExxonMobil introduced a global portfolio of custom-compounded polyolefins to automotive customers based on ongoing investment in technology and compounding expertise. These products complement the company's neat polymer and impact copolymer product lines, providing a complete line of products for automotive interior, exterior, and under hood applications.
A milestone in the development of improved tire inner liners that combines the elasticity of a rubber with the low-air permeability of a plastic was also announced by ExxonMobil and The Yokohama Rubber Co., Ltd (YRC). The new technology is based on proprietary polymers and polymer alloys developed by ExxonMobil, as well as alloys and application technology developed by YRC. Advantages include improved durability and lower rolling resistance.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
Identify and Pursue All Attractive Exploration Opportunities
ExxonMobil's Exploration Company is organized to identify, evaluate, pursue, and capture all high-quality opportunities that span the full range of resource lifecycle and type:
ExxonMobil's gross undeveloped exploration acreage totaled 105 million acres in 31 countries at year-end 2006. This geographically and geologically diverse, high-quality portfolio balances risk and reward to deliver both near-term production and long-term resource growth.
By taking a long-term approach, ExxonMobil is optimally positioned to capture a balanced portfolio of new high-quality opportunities, including conventional, discovered undeveloped, and unconventional resources. Opportunities are prioritized on a global basis and tested to ensure viability across a broad range of future business environments.
This approach resulted in the successful capture of 15 opportunities in 2006, ranging from new, untested exploration plays to already-discovered, but undeveloped resources and unconventional resources. In total, 4.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels were added to the resource base in 2006, from both the acquisition of discovered resources captured in 2006 and from exploratory drilling on acreage acquired in and prior to 2006.
Identification and Pursuit Process
ExxonMobil continually works to identify new quality opportunities around the world. Our global organization evaluates potential opportunities from the world's hydrocarbon endowment, whether the opportunities are in unexplored basins in remote areas, discovered fields in established areas, or unconventional resources such as heavy oil and tight gas. The resulting robust portfolio includes a diverse range of resource types located in many different regions.
Once identified, each opportunity undergoes a gated evaluation process in which it is screened on a globally consistent basis for quality and materiality. Opportunities that pass the initial screening are tested for technical achievability and commercial viability. Only the best, most robust opportunities are progressed. Other opportunities continue to be evaluated for improvement potential with additional data and new insights.
When the technology to effectively develop a high-quality resource does not exist, our industry-leading research and development teams are engaged to develop the necessary technology. This disciplined process delivers cost-effective quality resources and ensures long-term production growth.

Resources and Reserves*
The size, quality, and diversity of ExxonMobil's inventory of discovered oil and gas resources are major strengths of the Corporation. ExxonMobil's resource base now stands at 74 billion oil-equivalent barrels, of which 31 percent is proved.
At year-end 2006, the resource base included 22.7 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved oil and gas reserves. ExxonMobil added 2.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels to proved reserves in 2006, while producing 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels. ExxonMobil replaced 122 percent of reserves produced, including asset sales (129 percent, excluding asset sales). We have also stated our 2006 proved reserves to reflect the impact of using December 31, 2006, prices. Including the impact of asset sales and year-end prices/ costs, we replaced 128 percent of reserves produced.
RESOURCE BASE
The resource base is updated annually to add new discoveries and resource acquisitions, and to reflect changes in estimates of existing resources. Revisions to existing resources include changes in recovery expectations resulting from new technologies, drilling, and ongoing evaluations. Volumes produced or sold during the year are removed from the resource base at year end.
The success of ExxonMobil's strategy of identifying and pursuing all attractive exploration opportunities is demonstrated by our five-year average of 3.2 billion oil-equivalent barrels per year of resource additions/acquisitions.
Effective use of ExxonMobil proprietary systems, processes, and best practices has resulted in continued low finding and resource-acquisition costs. In 2006 finding and resource-acquisition costs were $0.53 per oil-equivalent barrel. Given timing considerations of capital outlays and resource base additions for large projects and resources, a longer time frame is appropriate for this performance measure. The five-year average finding and resource-acquisition cost is $0.51 per oil-equivalent barrel.
Resource additions/acquisitions over the past five years are balanced geographically and represent a wide range of resource types. Gas that we anticipate will be utilized for LNG projects constitutes approximately 28 percent of the additions. Approximately 13 percent of added resources are located in deep water, and 24 percent are conventional.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO PROVED RESERVES
Resources are classified as either proved or non-proved. The process to move non-proved resources to proved reserves begins once technical and commercial confidence supports a development decision.
The annual reporting of proved reserves is the product of ExxonMobil's long-standing process, which ensures consistency and management accountability with respect to all reserves bookings. All reserves additions and revisions follow a rigorous and structured management review process that is stewarded by a team of experienced reserves experts with global responsibilities. ExxonMobil has always taken this approach to booking proved reserves in accordance with a standard of reasonable certainty for recovery.
ExxonMobil has consistently added new proved reserves through large development projects worldwide. Significant additions to proved reserves have also been achieved through upward revisions for existing assets by the application of in-depth technical analysis as production and reservoir data are obtained and assessed.
ExxonMobil calculates its reserves using the same price basis used in making investment decisions and manages its business using the reserves calculated in this manner. Beginning in 2004, ExxonMobil has also been required to calculate proved reserves using year-end prices and costs. However, the use of prices from a single date is not relevant to investment decisions made by the Corporation, and annual variations in reserves based on such year-end prices are of no consequence in how the business is actually managed.
PROVED RESERVES
ExxonMobil has added over 18 billion oil-equivalent barrels to proved reserves over the last 10 years, more than replacing production. The 10-year reserve replacement has been 115 percent.
The development of new fields discovered through exploration and extensions of existing fields have added an average of 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels per year to proved reserves over the last five years. These include proved additions in 2006 in Qatar, Angola, Nigeria, Norway, the United States, and Canada.
Revisions have averaged about 0.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels per year over the last five years, resulting from effective reservoir management and the application of new technology.
ExxonMobil's proved reserves of 22.7 billion oil-equivalent barrels equates to a reserves life at current production rates of 14.2 years. At year-end 2006, approximately 64 percent of the company's proved reserves were classified as developed.

Invest in Projects that Deliver Superior Returns
ExxonMobil continues to demonstrate an ability to deliver superior returns from Upstream projects through disciplined investment and industry-leading project execution.
Across the industry, the challenge of bringing new energy supplies to market on-budget and on-schedule is increasing, which plays to ExxonMobil's strengths. Our competitive advantage in project execution is multifaceted. The experience of our project management professionals, developed through working on a wide variety of global projects, provides ExxonMobil with the capacity to effectively execute today's mega-projects. Our functional organization facilitates a disciplined approach to project management as well as the swift transfer of lessons learned and best practices. Our commitment to and investment in technology bring lower costs and higher reliability through innovative solutions to today's complex challenges.
ExxonMobil has an industry-leading portfolio of diverse opportunities that includes conventional, heavy oil, tight gas, shale gas, deepwater, LNG, arctic, and acid/sour gas projects. This portfolio of over 110 projects is expected to ultimately develop over 24 billion oil-equivalent barrels (net). While we work to progress all these opportunities, the size of our portfolio provides the ability to grow the business while selectively funding only those projects that will be robust in a wide range of economic conditions.
Project Execution Excellence
The professionalism, organization, and experience of ExxonMobil's workforce result in the delivery of on-time and on-budget projects. Our 2006 performance was consistent with that of the last five years. Over this time period, the average facilities cost of 47 ExxonMobil-operated projects came in at the level projected at funding. On average, these projects were brought onstream within 5 percent of the timing projected at funding. This represents industry-leading performance.
Project Execution
The ExxonMobil Capital Project System, or EMCAPS, is the process used globally to manage our capital investment across the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses. It utilizes "best practice" work processes and tools with clearly conveyed expectations and decision points that are well understood by our project management teams.
Once a resource has been acquired and a commercial opportunity identified, EMCAPS is the process that governs project development and through which all our projects flow. Each project starts in the Planning for Development phase. The most optimal development concept is then selected, followed by a detailed definition and design phase that must be mature prior to execution. Finally, the project is transitioned to operations. At each stage in this process, the project is subjected to scrutiny by management and peer groups of experienced professionals to ensure all risks have been identified and mitigated. Comprehensive contractor oversight is applied throughout the project.
Successful application of this project management system requires the interplay of several key components, including a strong opportunity base, experienced professionals, a long history of project execution excellence, discipline and consistency in all that we do, focused organizations, and the capacity for effective technology development and deployment.

DRILLING AND COMPLETIONS
Drilling and completing wells are critical components of development projects and become more critical as we take on ever more complex drilling challenges. ExxonMobil's global drilling organization is embedded in the Development Company to ensure our activity on all our wells worldwide reflects best practices derived from our global experience.
ExxonMobil utilizes a standardized global well planning process to ensure that all wells are optimally designed. This disciplined approach guides multifunctional teams to balance cost optimization and wellbore functionality.
During the design phase, all relevant information is incorporated to determine the optimum well path and completion. The well is designed using standards established by our Global Drilling Organization. Coincident with this, the Global Procurement Organization is engaged to acquire third-party services and materials, using strategic sourcing to reduce total system cost.
During the execution phase, on-site ExxonMobil personnel and third-party contractors continually analyze well data to reduce time and cost through utilization of our Fast Drill Process. As a result, drilling efficiency, as measured by average feet drilled per day, has improved significantly.
Since 2002, drilling complexity has increased approximately 20 percent, and completion complexity has increased nearly 60 percent, based on a consistent index applied to all wells.
Application of our Fast Drill Process has resulted in significant rate-of-penetration gains around the world.
Global Knowledge Transfer
A distinguishing feature of ExxonMobil's drilling organization is its ability to rapidly disseminate new technology and incorporate knowledge gained on a global basis. From the Houston office, a team of technical experts provides expertise to local drilling groups on subjects that include well control, drilling fluids, extended-reach drilling, deepwater drilling, and new completions technology. This team also ensures real-time assimilation and rapid sharing of lessons learned and best practices on a worldwide scale. For example, industry-leading quality control practices developed for deepwater exploration well testing operations offshore Angola were successfully shared and implemented offshore Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Australia. Advances in deepwater tree installation and gravel pack completion learnings in the Gulf of Mexico were transferred to Angola, resulting in lower well costs, Extended reach drilling practices developed offshore California were transferred to eastern Canada and eventually enabled industry record-setting performance at Sakhalin-1.

PROJECT TECHNOLOGY, EXPERIENCE, AND EXECUTION
ExxonMobil applies a suite of proprietary technologies and project execution expertise to successfully develop challenging resources on-time and on-budget.
A History of LNG Leadership
ExxonMobil has been involved in the development of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects for over 35 years. We have consistently delivered performance and technology step-outs that have enabled LNG to be a vital part of today's global energy supply. Highlights of ExxonMobil's leadership include:
Superior Execution Performance
In November 2006 Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company II, a joint venture with Qatar Petroleum, started up Train 5, the third of the world-scale 4.7-million-tons-per-year LNG trains. The offshore facilities that produce the feed gas to the train came onstream in January 2007. These milestones highlight the benefits of our "design one, build multiple" strategy. In a difficult contracting market environment, Train 5 started up just 29 months after the major engineering/construction contract award and was completed 6 percent under budget. This strategy is being extended to the next generation of 7.8-million-tons-per-year liquefaction trains with plans for starting up all four trains within an 18-month period beginning in 2008.
The next-generation trains will be supported by a fleet of LNG ships with capacities up to 80 percent greater than those commonly in use today. The new ships will incorporate the most efficient propulsion and cargo boil-off handling systems in the industry. With the use of common ship designs to optimize construction and maximize purchasing leverage, the massive acquisition program of 41 ships by 2009 provides significant savings. This integrated approach that improves the economies of scale of LNG production and shipping extends the global reach and competitiveness of Qatar LNG.
Tight Gas Completion Technology
Worldwide, enormous quantities of natural gas are locked up in "tight" reservoirs that are characterized by low flow rates and are not commercially robust with standard completion methods. In the Piceance Basin of western Colorado, where ExxonMobil holds a large position of nearly 300,000 acres, we are employing our patented Multi-Zone Stimulation Technology (MZST) to rapidly create numerous fractures in the reservoir rock so that gas can flow more easily to the wellbore. Compared to conventional approaches, MZST provides a material improvement in our ability to quickly generate many high-quality fractures. This technological advance and operational experience provide us with the means to pursue this challenging resource type elsewhere around the globe.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
Arctic
The Arctic is a large, lightly explored region with significant hydrocarbon potential. However, exploration in this region holds a broad range of technical and commercial challenges. With our experience operating in arctic conditions, ExxonMobil is prepared to pursue this potential and to address these challenges.
ExxonMobil's arctic experience began in 1933, with the first commercial oil field at Norman Wells in northern Canada. Since then, ExxonMobil has produced almost 3.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels from fields located in arctic regions. Today, ExxonMobil has more than 7 billion oil-equivalent barrels of recoverable resources in arctic environments.
Cost-effective and environmentally safe development of arctic resources requires innovative technology. Offshore platforms must be designed to withstand ice loading, icebergs, and severe arctic storms. Transportation of hydrocarbons may require ice-breaking tankers and terminals capable of year-round operation in severe weather conditions. Subsea pipelines must be buried below the seafloor to avoid damage due to ice scour. Onshore pipelines must be designed to withstand the strain of frost heave and thaw settlement in areas of discontinuous permafrost, while minimizing the impact on the environment.
With a strong focus on technology and upstream research and development, ExxonMobil remains at the forefront of arctic technology, and is well-positioned to take on the challenges of these significant opportunities.
NAFPac Completion Technology
ExxonMobil is a leader in developing and applying innovative technology that delivers best-in-class completions. One example is the Non-Aqueous Fluid Pack (NAFPac) completion technology developed and first used in the deepwater Angola Kizomba Project. This ExxonMobil patent-pending technology minimizes wellbore contact with water-based completion fluids that often results in wellbore instability and operational downtime.
When combined with our patented technology, NAFPac delivers 100 percent gravel placement to the completion, preventing sand production and maximizing production for the life of the field. The end result is installation of a superior completion with reliable sand control and maximized production at low cost.

Maximize Profitability of Existing Oil and Gas Production
We accomplish this strategy by applying the most cost-effective technology and operations management systems to each and every asset to maximize the commercial recovery of hydrocarbons.
ExxonMobil's asset base is robust in a range of economic environments and strengthened by its diversity. In addition to being geographically diverse, the production base consists of both mature fields and fields that are early in their producing life.
ExxonMobil places significant emphasis on managing underlying base performance and generating opportunities to maximize the value of our assets. Our high-quality reservoir management and rigorous depletion planning enhance the long-term performance of each field. We continually invest in the existing asset base to increase resource recovery, maximize profitability, and extend field life. New production volumes are generated through implementing projects, drilling new wells, and working over existing wells. Some assets may have characteristics favorable for enhanced oil recovery, a technology in which ExxonMobil is a recognized industry leader.
All of these activities are performed with a structured focus on cost management and capital discipline. A commitment to excellence in operations ensures operations integrity and maximum production uptime. In addition, our asset base is continuously under review. In some cases, the greatest value is created through divestment.
As with other functional areas, ExxonMobil employs a global organization to manage existing oil and gas assets. With this structure, we are able to leverage the transfer of technology and best practices across our global portfolio and to implement the systems and processes needed to consistently ensure operational excellence. We establish priorities on a global basis and deploy the people with the right skills when and where they are needed. ExxonMobil has an experienced, dedicated, and diverse workforce of exceptional quality.
Our Upstream business consistently captures more earnings per barrel than our competitors. This is a reflection of our investment discipline and commitment to superior execution.
 
Focus on Operations Integrity
Operations integrity is fundamental to our success and is a top priority. Under the umbrella of the Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS), our integrity management processes address all aspects of our business and define our global standards for safe and environmentally sound operations. For example, our Facility Integrity Management System (FIMS) ensures that critical equipment is proactively inspected and maintained throughout its lifecycle.
With FIMS, we have globally deployed integrity guidelines specifying minimum standards for testing, monitoring, inspection, and maintenance for 250 classes of equipment used in our operations. We have implemented management processes to ensure that integrity programs are carried out, results are reported, and corrective action taken when necessary. We monitor the status of our facility integrity on a global basis to ensure compliance and direct resources to priority areas. Our objective is to reduce incidents by pre-empting equipment failure, which translates into better safety performance, higher production reliability, and lower cost.

PRODUCTION VOLUMES
In 2006 total liquids production was 2.7 million barrels per day. Natural gas production available for sale totaled 9.3 billion cubic feet per day. New projects and work programs more than offset declines in existing fields. Additionally, ExxonMobil was awarded a 28-percent working interest in the Upper Zakum field in Abu Dhabi effective January 2006, which added 147 thousand barrels per day of oil production. In total, 2006 production was 4 percent higher than 2005.
Near-term growth in production capacity is expected to be led by key liquids projects offshore West Africa, Russia, and the Caspian, and from gas project activities in Qatar. Production from North America and Europe is expected to continue to provide a strong, profitable base underpinning our growth.
Timing of individual project start-ups could have a material impact on the production outlook. While the outlook reflects our best assumptions on project timing, projects will be funded and executed only when they have achieved a level of maturity that provides adequate confidence of robust performance in a wide range of economic conditions.
Other factors impacting year-to-year production volumes include operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, asset sales, severe weather events, and price effects under production sharing contracts.
OPTIMIZATION OF EXISTING-FIELD PRODUCTION
ExxonMobil employs many systems and processes to ensure maximum profitable production from existing assets.
A key component to optimizing base volumes is our focus on improving production uptime. This is managed through reliability improvement activities, rigorous shutdown planning, and disciplined root-cause analysis of downtime events.
Reservoir surveillance and well maintenance programs are designed to enhance production from existing wells. Global processes, such as asset development and depletion, and reservoir management best practices, are leveraged to ensure every asset is optimized. Additional drilling, workovers, and secondary or tertiary recovery projects are implemented to access and develop resources not captured during initial development.
Minor projects are developed for field extensions, for additional reservoirs identified during a field's initial development, and for infrastructure changes (e.g., compression and low pressure operations) necessary to deplete a field's reserves.
Enhanced oil recovery (EOR)/Improved oil recovery (IOR) activity includes using water or gas injection, heavy-oil steam flooding, or sour-gas injection techniques to increase reservoir recovery.

Capitalize on Growing Natural Gas and Power Markets
Global reach is a key competitive advantage of the ExxonMobil natural gas business. We have employees dedicated to sales and market development in almost all major and developing markets. ExxonMobil markets 11.2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas in 28 countries to a wide variety of customers, including power companies, industrial users, and distributors. Additionally, we manage over 1 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids and significant production of power and helium.
A major strength is our ability to integrate our Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses, allowing us to maximize value for our gas, natural gas liquids, and power.
NORTH AMERICAN GAS MARKET
With North America gas demand likely to grow about 0.5 percent per year on average to 2030, and domestic supply from existing wells declining, continued investments in existing fields and new discoveries are required. ExxonMobil is expanding development of tight gas in the Piceance Basin in Colorado, and plans to initiate production from the Barnett Shale near Dallas in 2007. The company has a leading position in arctic gas resources in the Mackenzie Delta region of northern Canada and on the North Slope of Alaska.
LNG imports are forecast to play an increasingly important role in the North American market. ExxonMobil is participating in a joint venture constructing the Golden Pass regasification terminal along the U.S. Gulf Coast, with a planned capacity of 2 billion cubic feet per day.
ExxonMobil has extensive experience in the North American gas market. This market understanding underpins our straightforward business model of continually optimizing our sales into the best available market. As in all other regional gas markets, we do not trade speculatively in any gas futures.
EUROPEAN GAS MARKET
European gas demand is expected to grow at about 1.5 percent per year through 2030, while regional production of natural gas is anticipated to begin declining in the next several years. This growing gap between demand and local production will result in a rapid increase in the need for imported gas supplies from new LNG and pipeline projects.
ExxonMobil has a significant existing production, infrastructure, and marketing asset base in Europe. In addition, the company's recent European gas business restructuring and its participation in the development of new gas supplies and infrastructure have strategically positioned ExxonMobil to help meet Europe's growing demand for natural gas.
The company is involved in multiple field developments in the North Sea, including the Ormen Lange and Statfjord Late Life projects. ExxonMobil holds capacity in the new Langeled pipeline from Norway to the United Kingdom, and the company's joint venture in the Netherlands, GasTerra, holds capacity in the BBL pipeline from the Netherlands to the U.K. Both pipelines started commercial operations in 2006 and provide additional gas import capacity to the U.K. To meet the growing demand for LNG in Europe, ExxonMobil and its partners are constructing the South Hook LNG Terminal in Milford Haven, U.K., and the offshore Adriatic LNG Terminal in Italy.

QATAR
ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum, with other joint-venture partners, are further developing the giant North Field, the largest non-associated gas field in the world. Resources exceeding 25 billion oil-equivalent barrels (gross) will be developed through existing and planned LNG trains and pipeline sales projects with ExxonMobil interest. Natural gas from the North Field is cost competitive for supplying LNG to the Asia Pacific region, Europe, and North America.
In 2006 three existing LNG trains at the Qatargas joint venture produced 9.8 million tons (gross) (ExxonMobil interest, 10 percent). The RasGas joint ventures (ExxonMobil interest, 25 to 34 percent) produced 15.1 million tons of LNG in 2006 (gross).
Work is progressing on the Qatargas II and Ras Laffan LNG 3 projects (ExxonMobil interest, 18 to 30 percent), which together include a total of four LNG trains with capacity of 7.8 million tons per year each. Deliveries from Qatargas II are planned primarily into the United Kingdom gas market via the South Hook LNG terminal. Deliveries from Ras Laffan LNG 3 are targeted for the U.S. gas market via the Golden Pass LNG terminal currently under construction, as well as to the Asian market. Also included in the supply-chain development are newly designed Q-Flex and Q-Max large LNG ships that will realize significant benefits from economies of scale. Associated condensate and natural gas liquids are being exported to markets worldwide.
Following the successful start-up of Phase I of the Al Khaleej domestic gas project in 2005 (ExxonMobil interest, 100 percent), major engineering and construction contracts for a second phase were awarded in 2006.
In early 2007, it was announced that ExxonMobil will participate with Qatar Petroleum in the initial phase of the Barzan Project, expected to deliver about 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of sales gas to domestic markets to support the State of Qatar's infrastructure and industry growth. Additionally, Qatar Petroleum has offered ExxonMobil participation in future phases of the Barzan Project. In parallel with this participation, ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum have agreed not to progress the Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) project that was the subject of a Heads of Agreement signed in 2004.
Upper Zakum Project
In March 2006, ExxonMobil and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) signed agreements through which ExxonMobil received a 28-percent interest in the Upper Zakum field effective January 1, 2006. This is one of the world's largest oil fields, with approximately 50 billion barrels originally in place, and less than 10 percent of the resource has been produced to date. ExxonMobil's industry-leading capabilities to improve oil recovery, efficiently build production capacity, transfer technology, and develop ADNOC staff were key considerations in our selection. As part of this agreement, an ExxonMobil Technology Center will be established in Abu Dhabi to apply industry's most advanced technology to Upper Zakum in areas of reservoir management, well management, and production operations. ExxonMobil will provide support for training and personnel development, and is advising in the establishment of a specialized research and development facility at the Petroleum Institute, the leading technical university in Abu Dhabi.

Refining & Supply
ExxonMobil's network of reliable and efficient manufacturing plants, transportation systems and distribution centers provides clean fuels, lubricants, and other high-value products and feedstocks to customers around the world. Our global supply organization optimizes our system  the supply of raw materials to our refineries, products supplied to our customers, and Upstream equity crude placement. Our proven business model is founded on continuous operations improvement, leveraging our global scale and integration to improve margins and deliver cost efficiencies, and a disciplined capital investment program to meet growing demand for high-quality products.
LARGEST GLOBAL REFINER
PURSUING OPERATIONS EXCELLENCE
Our goal is flawless operations. We continuously strive to improve personnel and operations safety, security, operations reliability, environmental performance, and business controls. We rely on the commitment of our people, global management systems, networks, and business planning processes to continually improve performance. For example, our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) framework establishes common worldwide expectations for mitigating operations integrity risks that are inherent in our business. Our processes and efficient execution have established us as an industry leader in operations excellence.
 
LEVERAGING GLOBAL SCALE & INTEGRATION
We are the world's largest global refining company, with the most distillation, conversion and lube basestock production capacity. On average, our refineries are over 60 percent larger than the industry average and are more integrated with chemical and lubes operations. This provides us greater flexibility to optimize operations and to produce higher-value products with lower feedstock and operating costs.
 
Table of Contents
      67
EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
Besides our scale and integration, our global functional organization, established networks, and research programs ensure rapid and efficient development and deployment of best practices and technology. We continue to leverage these structural advantages to generate more than a billion dollars before tax each year in refining "self-help" margin improvements and operating efficiencies.
These structural advantages are difficult for competitors to duplicate.
INCREASING MARGIN
We improve margin by maximizing utilization of refining capacity, economically growing capacity, reducing the cost of raw materials, and improving yields of high-value products.
 ExxonMobil increases refinery utilization and throughput by improving reliability, eliminating constraints, shortening the time required to complete turnarounds, optimizing intervals between downtimes, and expanding market outlets. Our improvements are driven by the disciplined application of management systems such as our Global Reliability System and our Molecule Management Program.
Utilization/Capacity
We also economically increase the capacity of our refineries through low-cost debottlenecks that are resilient even in low margin environments. For example, last year we expanded distillation capacity at our Antwerp, Belgium, refinery by over 20 thousand barrels per day via low-cost debottlenecking steps. In total, we have effectively added the equivalent capacity of a new industry-average-size refinery to our portfolio every three years, and an average-size conversion unit every year, at a fraction of grassroots cost.
 We continue to find new, innovative methods to reduce raw material costs. We have expanded the application of advanced molecular fingerprinting and modeling technologies that improve our understanding of the behavior and characteristics of materials moving through our refineries. This technology enables us to more precisely select and blend crudes with properties that will maximize margins through our operating facilities.
Raw Materials
We are also an industry leader in utilizing challenged crudes that are typically discounted in the marketplace because they have properties that make them difficult to process. Since 2003, we have increased our processing of acidic, synthetic, and other challenged crudes by 40 percent.
PIPELINE REVERSAL
In 2006 we completed a pipeline reversal from Patoka, Illinois, to Port Arthur, Texas, allowing up to 60 thousand barrels per day of advantaged Canadian crude to be processed at our Beaumont and Baytown refineries.
 In addition to benefiting raw material selection, our Molecule Management technology also enables us to optimize the yields and blending of high-value products on a real-time basis. The approach is built on ExxonMobil's proprietary technology and petroleum knowledge base, something our competitors cannot easily duplicate. Overall, our Molecule Management Program is currently delivering about $750 million per year in benefits, and we are in the process of extending optimization technologies into our transportation systems. We expect the overall prize to grow to $1 billion per year before the end of the decade.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
IMPROVING OPERATING EFFICIENCY
Our worldwide cash operating costs at our refineries are substantially below the industry average, as confirmed by external benchmarking with Solomon Associates, Inc. We achieve this by leveraging our scale and integration as well as our leading-edge technology to produce efficiencies. We have been successful in developing energy and cost efficiencies that largely offset inflation pressures and increased expenses for operations improvements, new process units, and production growth.
 Improved energy efficiency is a key contributor to our cost performance. In 2006 we sustained our improvement trend, and have been improving our energy efficiency at a rate about twice that of industry. ExxonMobil's proprietary Global Energy Management System (GEMS) focuses on opportunities that reduce the energy consumed at our refineries and chemical complexes. Approximately $1.5 billion of annual pretax savings has been identified to date, equal to 15 to 20 percent of the energy consumed at our refining and chemical facilities. As of year-end 2006, we have captured over 50 percent of these savings.
Energy Initiatives
We continue to make significant investments in cogeneration facilities, which require substantially less energy and result in lower emissions versus separate conventional steam and power generation. In addition to the large facility we recently started up at Beaumont, Texas, we have several cogeneration facilities being progressed for start-up in future years. Besides reducing energy consumption, our GEMS system and cogeneration also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 In addition to energy efficiency, we are capturing other cost efficiencies. We have merged support organizations at our integrated sites to capture economies of scale and rolled out a global training initiative to improve productivity. We have also lowered repair costs through improved equipment health monitoring and the use of advanced erosion-resistant materials.
Cost Efficiencies
      
MAINTAINING CAPITAL DISCIPLINE
Refining & Supply capital expenditures are focused on selective and resilient investments that yield competitive advantage. These investments meet product quality requirements, reduce environmental impact, further upgrade safety systems, lower operating costs, and produce higher-value products and chemical feedstocks using lower-cost raw materials. We also continue to implement projects that enhance refinery capacity and yield at much less than grassroots cost and generate an attractive return, even at bottom-of-cycle market conditions.

DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE PROVIDES GLOBAL OUTLET
Fuels Marketing provides a ratable and secure outlet for our refineries and continues to be well-positioned to successfully compete in a dynamic and competitive marketplace by maintaining focus on key business fundamentals: superior safety and environmental performance, operating efficiencies from our global scale and integration, disciplined capital management, and customer focused marketing initiatives.
OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND INTEGRATION
We continue to leverage integration between our marketing and refining businesses. Downstream cross-functional teams focus on optimizing product placement across the broad spectrum of customer segments to capture the highest value for our refined molecules. Highgrading sales to higher-value channels increased fuels income by over $100 million in 2006.
Operating efficiencies continue to be captured from the global application of innovative technologies, centralization of support activities, and simplification and automation of work processes. In 2006, the combined impact of our efficiency initiatives reduced ongoing operating expenses by $150 million. In addition, improved category management in our convenience stores, car wash operations, and strategic alliances with leading food and grocery marketers have together resulted in nonfuels income growth of $75 million in 2006. The combined benefit of these improvements enhance the resiliency of our retail outlets by further reducing the fuels margin we require for our service stations to break-even.

CAPTURE FULL BENEFITS OF INTEGRATION ACROSS EXXONMOBIL OPERATIONS
ExxonMobil Chemical's manufacturing network is distributed across the globe. Over 90 percent of the chemical capacity that we own and operate is integrated with our large refining complexes or natural gas processing plants.
Integration benefits continue to be one of the key differentiating factors of our company. In addition to the flexibility and cost savings that physical integration of sites affords, optimization of feedstock and production plans through sophisticated models provides sustained advantages. At these joint sites, maintenance, laboratory, engineering and other services are shared. More broadly, best practices in areas such as safety, reliability, and training are transferred globally across all organizations.
ExxonMobil's breadth of experience and commitment across the upstream, downstream and petrochemical businesses are demonstrated sources of competitive advantage. In addition, our petrochemical technology, market understanding and applications expertise enable the Corporation to offer potential partners and host governments a comprehensive, integrated approach to major project development.
CONSISTENTLY DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS PERFORMANCE
The company maintains a consistent and relentless focus on operational excellence. Through many years of effort, business practices and systems have been developed to ensure the uncompromised integrity of our operations and delivery of industry-leading performance.
The company's disciplined approach to safety, productivity, reliability, and quality improvement has continually increased the contribution of existing assets. Over the last five years, improved reliability, elimination of constraints, and technology advances have added the equivalent capacity of about one-and-a-half steam crackers at significantly less than grassroots cost.
Energy efficiencies are being identified and captured at ExxonMobil facilities through the extensive use of our Global Energy Management System, a corporate-wide set of best practices and technologies. The energy consumed per unit of product output has decreased by more than 9 percent over the last four years  an improvement pace twice that of competition.
The company also benefits from marketing excellence initiatives aimed at continuously improving areas such as transactional excellence, optimization of supply chain networks, growth of premium products in target markets, working capital management, and continuous enhancement of enabling technology.
BUILD PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY POSITIONS
Technology is a major source of competitive advantage and differentiation. Our goal is to provide value to our customers by better understanding their needs and meeting their expectations through focused product innovation and application support. We also focus significant research toward the development of leading process technology and utilization of lower-cost, advantaged feedstocks.

Frequently Used Terms
Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil's key business and financial performance measures and other terms. These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation. In the case of financial measures that we believe constitute "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, we provide a reconciliation to the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure and other information required by that rule.
EARNINGS EXCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, ACCOUNTING CHANGE, AND OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS
In addition to reporting U.S. GAAP defined net income, ExxonMobil also presents a measure of earnings that excludes earnings from discontinued operations, a required accounting change, and other special items quantified and described in our quarterly and annual earnings press releases. Earnings excluding the aforementioned items is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is included to facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods. A reconciliation to net income is shown on page 16. We also refer to earnings excluding discontinued operations, accounting changes, and other special items as normalized earnings. Earnings per share amounts use the same average common shares outstanding as used for the calculation of net income per common share and net income per common share - assuming dilution.
Operating costs are the combined total of production, manufacturing, selling, general, administrative, exploration, depreciation, and depletion expenses from the Consolidated Statement of Income and ExxonMobil's share of similar costs for equity companies. Operating costs are the costs during the period to produce, manufacture, and otherwise prepare the company's products for sale - including energy costs, staffing, maintenance, and other costs to explore for and produce oil and gas, and operate refining and chemical plants. Distribution and marketing expenses are also included. Operating costs exclude the cost of raw materials, taxes, discontinued operations, and interest expense. These expenses are on a before-tax basis. While ExxonMobil's management is responsible for all revenue and expense elements of net income, operating costs, as defined below, represent the expenses most directly under management's control. Information regarding these costs is therefore useful for investors and ExxonMobil management in evaluating management's performance.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
CAPITAL EMPLOYED
Capital employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil's net share of property, plant, and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes ExxonMobil's share of total debt and shareholders' equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil's share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.
RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE)
Return on average capital employed is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning- and end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil's share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with the Corporation's definition of capital employed and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation's total ROCE is net income excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry, both to evaluate management's performance and to demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long term. Additional measures, which tend to be more cash-flow based, are used to make investment decisions.
Return on Average Capital Employed
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
Shareholder return measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. We calculate shareholder return over a particular measurement period by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period. For this purpose, we assume dividends are reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the same time actual dividends are paid. Shareholder return is usually quoted on an annualized basis.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES (Capex)
Capital and exploration expenditures are the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant, and equipment and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the Consolidated Statement of Income. ExxonMobil's Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant, and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil's management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.
FINDING AND RESOURCE-ACQUISITION COSTS
Finding and resource-acquisition costs per oil-equivalent barrel is a performance measure that is calculated using the Exploration portion of Upstream capital and exploration expenditures and proved property acquisition costs divided by resource additions (in oil-equivalent barrels). ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries and acquisitions of discovered resources as resource additions. In addition to proved reserves, resource additions include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but which ExxonMobil believes will likely be moved into the proved reserves category and produced in the future.
LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES
In this report, we use the term "proved reserves" to mean quantities of oil and gas that ExxonMobil has determined to be reasonably certain of recovery under existing economic and operating conditions on the basis of our long-standing, rigorous management review process. We only book proved reserves when we have made significant funding commitments for the related projects. In this report, we aggregate proved reserves of consolidated and equity companies, excluding royalties and quantities due others, since ExxonMobil does not view these reserves differently from a management perspective. To reflect management's view of ExxonMobil's total liquids reserves, proved reserves in this report also include oil-sands reserves from Canadian Syncrude operations, which are reported separately as mining reserves in our Form 10-K and proxy statement. Oil-sands reserves included in this report totaled 718 million barrels in 2006, 738 million barrels at year-end 2005, 757 million barrels at year-end 2004, 781 million barrels at year-end 2003, and 800 million barrels at year-end 2002. For our own management purposes and as discussed in this report, we determine proved reserves based on price and cost assumptions that are consistent with those used to make investment decisions. Therefore, the proved reserves in this report are not directly comparable to the data reported in our Form 10-K and proxy statement. Based on regulatory guidance, ExxonMobil began in 2004 to state our results in the Form 10-K and proxy statement to reflect the impacts on proved reserves of utilizing December 31 liquids and natural gas prices ("year-end price/cost effects"). On this basis, year-end proved reserves, including year-end price/cost effects, totaled 22.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels in 2006, 22.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in 2005, and 21.7 billion oil-equivalent barrels in 2004. Excluding year-end price/cost effects, 2006 proved reserves totaled 22.7 billion oil-equivalent barrels, 2005 proved reserves totaled 22.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels, while 2004 proved reserves totaled 22.2 billion oil-equivalent barrels.
RESOURCES, RESOURCE BASE, AND RECOVERABLE RESOURCES
Resources, resource base, recoverable oil, recoverable hydrocarbons, recoverable resources, and similar terms used in this report are the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. In addition to proved reserves, the resource base includes quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but which ExxonMobil believes will likely be moved into the proved reserves category and produced in the future.
PROVED RESERVES REPLACEMENT RATIO
Proved reserves replacement ratio is a performance measure that is calculated using proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided by oil-equivalent production. Both proved reserves additions and production include amounts applicable to equity companies. The ratio usually reported by ExxonMobil excludes sales and year-end price/cost effects, and includes Canadian oil-sands mining operations in both additions and production volumes. See the definition of "liquids and natural gas proved reserves" above and the listing of inclusions and exclusions on pages 60 and 61.
Table of Contents
  91
EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2006 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
PROVED RESERVES REPLACEMENT COSTS
Proved reserves replacement costs per oil-equivalent barrel is a performance measure ratio. Proved reserves replacement costs per barrel are costs incurred in property acquisition and exploration, plus costs incurred in development activities divided by proved oil-equivalent reserves additions, excluding sales. Both the costs incurred and the proved reserves additions include amounts applicable to equity companies as well as Canadian oil-sands operations and exclude year-end price/cost effects. See the definition of "liquids and natural gas proved reserves" on the preceding page.
HEAVY OIL
Heavy oil, for the purpose of this report, includes heavy oil, extra heavy oil, and bitumen, as defined by the World Petroleum Congress in 1987 based on API gravity and viscosity at reservoir conditions. Heavy oil has an API gravity between 10 and 22.3 degrees. The API gravity of extra heavy oil and bitumen is less than 10 degrees. Extra heavy oil has a viscosity less than 10 thousand centipoise, whereas the viscosity of bitumen is greater than 10 thousand centipoise. The term "oil sands" is used to indicate heavy oil (generally bitumen) that is recovered in a mining operation.
CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES
Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant, and equipment from the Summary Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow is the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation's assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation's strategic and financial objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives, or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
The Corporation distributed cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share purchases. Shares are purchased both to reduce shares outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs. For purposes of calculating distributions to shareholders, the Corporation only includes the cost of those shares purchased to reduce shares outstanding.
