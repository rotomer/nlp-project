Exxon Mobil Corporation News Release, dated November 1, 2007, announcing third quarter 2007 results.

3Q07 Investor Relations Data Summary.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
:
EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED
"ExxonMobil's third quarter net income was $9,410 million ($1.70 per share), down 10% from the third quarter of 2006, while earnings per share were down 4% for the same period.  The decrease reflected lower downstream and chemical margins partly offset by higher crude oil realizations.  Net income of $28,950 million for the first nine months of 2007 was $300 million lower than the record first nine months of 2006.  Earnings per share increased 6% during the same period, reflecting the positive impact of the continuing share purchase program.
ExxonMobil continued to actively invest in the third quarter, spending $5.4 billion on capital and exploration projects, an increase of 8% over 2006.  For the first nine months of 2007, spending on capital and exploration projects was $14.7 billion.    
The Corporation distributed a total of $8.9 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends of $1.9 billion and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding of $7.0 billion."
THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
Net income was $9,410 million.  
Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately $15.8 billion, including asset sales of $700 million.
Spending on capital and exploration projects was $5.4 billion.
Excluding the impact of entitlements, divestments, OPEC quota effects and Venezuela, production on an oil-equivalent basis increased by 3%.
ExxonMobil announced plans to construct a second world-scale steam cracker complex in Singapore.  In addition to the one million tons-per-year ethylene steam cracker, the new complex will include polyethylene, polypropylene, specialty elastomers and aromatics extraction units.  The project, which will be integrated with our existing facilities, will employ ExxonMobil's latest proprietary technologies and enhance our ability to meet increasing demand in the region.  Start-up is expected in early 2011.  
Third Quarter 2007 vs. Third Quarter 2006
Upstream earnings were $6,299 million, down $194 million from the third quarter of 2006 primarily reflecting lower natural gas realizations and higher operating expenses, mostly offset by higher crude oil realizations.
On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased by 2% from the third quarter of 2006.  Excluding the impact of entitlements, divestments, OPEC quota effects and Venezuela, production was up 3%.
Liquids production of 2,536 kbd (thousands of barrels per day) was 111 kbd lower.  Mature field decline and reduced entitlements were partly offset by increased production from projects in Africa and Russia.  Excluding the impact of entitlements, divestments, OPEC quota effects and Venezuela, liquids production was up 3%.
Third quarter natural gas production was 8,302 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), up 163 mcfd from 2006.   Increased volume from projects in Qatar was partly offset by the impact of mature field decline.  Excluding entitlement and divestment effects, natural gas production increased by 3%.
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,196 million, $4 million higher than the third quarter of 2006.  Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $5,103 million, down $198 million from 2006.
Downstream earnings were $2,001 million, down $737 million from the third quarter of 2006, driven by lower refining and fuels marketing margins.  Petroleum product sales were 7,101 kbd, 201 kbd lower than last year's third quarter.
U.S. Downstream earnings were $914 million, down $358 million from the third quarter of 2006.  Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $1,087 million were $379 million lower.
Chemical earnings were $1,202 million, down $149 million from the third quarter of 2006 due to lower margins partly offset by favorable tax items.  Prime product sales of 6,729 kt (thousands of metric tons) in the third quarter of 2007 were down 23 kt from the prior year.
Corporate and financing expenses of $92 million were flat with 2006.
During the third quarter of 2007, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 90 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $7.8 billion.  These purchases included $7.0 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans and programs.  Shares outstanding were reduced from 5,546 million at the end of the second quarter to 5,464 million at the end of the third quarter.  Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
First Nine Months 2007 vs. First Nine Months 2006
FIRST NINE MONTHS HIGHLIGHTS
Net income was $28,950 million.
Earnings per share of $5.15 reflected strong earnings and increased by 6% due to the reduction in the number of shares outstanding.

Liquids production of 2,649 kbd decreased by 33 kbd from 2006.  Higher production from projects in Africa and Russia was offset by mature field decline and reduced entitlements.  Excluding the impact of entitlements, divestments, OPEC quota effects and Venezuela, liquids production increased 5%.
Natural gas production of 9,043 mcfd decreased 302 mcfd from 2006.  Lower volume from mature field decline was partly offset by projects in Qatar, Europe, Canada and Malaysia.

Downstream earnings were a record $7,306 million, an increase of $812 million from 2006 reflecting stronger marketing margins, refinery optimization activities and the sale of the Ingolstadt refinery, partly offset by lower refining margins.

Estimates of key financial and operating data follow.  
ExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters on a webcast at 10 a.m. Central time on November 1, 2007.  To listen to the event live or in archive, go to our website at "exxonmobil.com".
Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking statements.  Actual results, including project plans and related expenditures, resource recoveries, timing and capacities, could differ materially due to changes in long-term oil or gas prices or other market conditions affecting the oil and gas industry; political events or disturbances; reservoir performance; the outcome of commercial negotiations; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2006 Form 10-K.  We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.
Consistent with previous practice this press release includes both earnings and earnings per share excluding special items.  Earnings and earnings per share that exclude special items are non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods.  A reconciliation to net income is shown in Attachment II.  The release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales.  Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities.  A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II.  Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures i s contained on pages 32 and 33 in the 2006 Form 10-K and is also available through the Investor Information section of our website at "exxonmobil.com".
