Item 5.02
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
(e)  On November 28, 2007, the Compensation Committee of Exxon Mobil Corporation (the "Corporation" or "ExxonMobil") established a total ceiling of $214 million in respect of 2007 under the Corporation's Short Term Incentive Program, of which bonuses were granted to certain officers as follows:
R. W. Tillerson:
$3,360,000
J. S. Simon:
$2,150,000
D. D. Humphreys:
$1,859,000
H. R. Cramer:
$1,586,000
S. R. McGill:
$1,260,000
Approximately 50 percent of the bonus will be paid to the executive in cash by year-end and the remaining 50 percent of the bonus will be paid on a deferred basis through the use of earnings bonus units ("EBUs").  Each EBU entitles the executive to receive an amount in cash equal to ExxonMobil's cumulative net income per common share as announced each quarter beginning after the grant.  Payout occurs on the third anniversary of the date of grant or when the maximum settlement value of $5.00 per unit is reached, if earlier.  The form of EBU instrument used for settlement of 2007 bonuses is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The Committee also established a total ceiling of 11 million shares in respect of 2007 to be granted as restricted stock or restricted stock units under the Corporation's 2003 Incentive Program, of which restricted stock awards were granted to certain officers as follows:
R. W. Tillerson:
185,000
shares
J. S. Simon:
107,000
shares
D. D. Humphreys:
90,800
shares
H. R. Cramer:
77,000
shares
These restricted shares may not be sold (i) for half the shares, until five years after grant, and (ii) for the balance of the shares, until 10 years after grant or until retirement, whichever occurs later. These restricted periods may not be accelerated except in case of death.  During the restricted period, shares may not be transferred and are subject to forfeiture.  Potential events of forfeiture include early termination of employment or detrimental activity.  Examples of detrimental activity could include violating ExxonMobil's ethics policies or going to work for a competitor.  During the restricted period the holder of restricted stock is otherwise generally treated as a registered shareholder with the right to receive dividends and vote the shares.  The form of terms of the 2007 restricted stock agreements with executive officers is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this report.
Effective December 1, 2007, the annual salary of H. R. Cramer will increase to $840,000.
Effective January 1, 2008, the annual salary of R. W. Tillerson will increase to $1,870,000.
All ExxonMobil executive officers are "at will" employees of the Corporation and do not have employment contracts.

This is granted in Dallas County, Texas by Exxon Mobil Corporation (the "Corporation") effective November 28, 2007 (the "date of grant"), pursuant to the Short Term Incentive Program adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on October 27, 1993, as amended (the "Program").  This award is subject to the provisions of this instrument and the Program and to such regulations and requirements as may be stipulated from time to time by the administrative authority defined in the Program and is granted on the condition that Grantee accepts such provisions, regulations and requirements.  This instrument incorporates by reference the provisions of the Program, as it may be amended from time to time, including without limitation the definitions of terms used in this instrument and defined in the Program.
EARNINGS BONUS UNIT AWARD
1.
.  The Corporation has granted to Grantee the number of earnings bonus units ("EBUs") set forth above, with each EBU having the maximum settlement value set forth above.  Subject to the other terms of this award, Grantee has the right, for each of these EBUs, to receive from the Corporation, promptly after the settlement date defined below, an amount of cash equal to the Corporation's cumulative net income per common share (basic) as reflected in its quarterly earnings statements as initially published commencing with earnings for the first full quarter following the date of grant to and including the last full quarter preceding the settlement date; provided, however, that the amount of such settlement will not exceed the maximum settlement value specified above.
Award
2.
.  The settlement date of these EBUs will be the earlier of the third anniversary of the date of grant, or the date of publication of the Corporation's quarterly earnings statement which brings the cumulative net income per common share (basic) as initially published commencing with the first full quarter following the date of grant to an amount at least equal to the maximum settlement value per EBU specified above.  
Settlement Date
3.
.  This award is provisional until the Corporation actually pays cash in settlement of the award.
Annulment
(a) If, before the Corporation pays such cash, Grantee terminates (other than by death) before standard retirement time within the meaning of the Program, this award will automatically expire as of the date of termination, except to the extent the administrative authority determines Grantee may retain this award.
(b) If, before the Corporation pays such cash, Grantee is determined to have engaged in detrimental activity within the meaning of the Program, this award will automatically expire as of the date of such determination.
4.
.  The number of EBUs covered by this award and the meaning of the term "common share" will be adjusted by the administrative authority as it deems appropriate to give effect to any stock split, stock dividend or other relevant change in capitalization of the Corporation after the date of grant and prior to the settlement date.

After this Agreement becomes effective, the Corporation will, subject to paragraph 5, issue to Grantee, on a restricted basis as explained below, the number of shares of the Corporation's common stock specified on the signature page.
.
Effective Date and Issuance of Restricted Stock
 2.
 If issued, the shares of restricted stock will be subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and to such regulations and requirements as the administrative authority of the Program may establish from time to time.  The shares will be issued only on the condition that Grantee accepts such provisions, regulations, and requirements.
.
Conditions
 3.
 During the applicable restricted periods specified in paragraph 4 of this Agreement,
.
Restrictions and Risk of Forfeiture
(a)  the shares under restriction may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise disposed of or encumbered, and any attempt to do so will be null and void; and
(b)  the shares under restriction may be forfeited as provided in paragraph 6.
 4.
 The restricted periods will commence at issuance and, unless the shares have been forfeited earlier under paragraph 6, will expire as follows, whether or not Grantee is still an employee:
.
Restricted Periods
(a)  with respect to 50% of the shares, on November 28, 2012; and
(b)  with respect to the remaining shares, on the later to occur of
(i)   November 28, 2017, or
(ii)  the first day of the calendar year immediately following the year in which Grantee terminates;
except that
(c)  the restricted periods will automatically expire with respect to all shares on the death of Grantee.
   5.  
The Corporation will have no obligation to issue the restricted stock and will have no other obligation to Grantee with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement if Grantee fails to complete, sign, and return the signature page of this Agreement on or before March 9, 2008.  In addition, whether or not Grantee has completed, signed, and returned the signature page, the Corporation will have no obligation to issue the restricted stock and will have no other obligation to Grantee with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement if, before the shares are actually issued:
.
No Obligation to Issue Restricted Stock
(a)
Grantee terminates (other than by death) before standard retirement time within the meaning of the Program, except to the extent the administrative authority of the Program determines Grantee may receive restricted stock under this Agreement; or
(b)
Grantee is determined to have engaged in detrimental activity within the meaning of the Program; or
(c)
Grantee fails to provide the Corporation with cash for any required taxes due at issuance of the shares, if Grantee is required to do so under paragraph 7.  
  6.  
 Until the applicable restricted period specified in paragraph 4 has expired, the shares under restriction will be forfeited or subject to forfeiture in the following circumstances:
.
Forfeiture of Shares After Issuance
(a)    If Grantee terminates (other than by death) before standard retirement time within the meaning of the Program, all shares for which the applicable restricted periods have not expired will be automatically forfeited and reacquired by the Corporation as of the date of termination, except to the extent the administrative authority determines Grantee may retain restricted stock issued under this Agreement.  
.
Termination
(b)    If Grantee is determined to have engaged in detrimental activity within the meaning of the Program, either before or after termination, all shares for which the applicable restricted periods have not expired will be automatically forfeited and reacquired by the Corporation as of the date of such determination.
.
Detrimental activity
(c)    The shares are subject to forfeiture in the discretion of the administrative authority if Grantee attempts to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose of or encumber them during the applicable restricted periods.
.
Attempted transfer
  7.  
 Notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer that otherwise apply, the Corporation in its sole discretion may withhold shares, either at the time of issuance, at the time the applicable restricted periods expire, or at any other time in order to satisfy any required withholding, social security, and similar taxes and contributions (collectively, "required taxes").  Withheld shares may be retained by the Corporation or sold on behalf of Grantee.  If the Corporation does not withhold shares to satisfy required taxes, in the alternative the Corporation may require Grantee to deposit with the Corporation cash in an amount determined by the Corporation to be necessary to satisfy required taxes.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Corporation will be under no obligation to issue or deliver shares to Grantee if Grantee fails timely to deposit such amount with the Corporation.  The Corporation in its sole discretion may also withhold any required taxes from dividends paid on the restricted stock.
.
Taxes
  8.  
 The shares will, upon issuance, be registered in the name of Grantee.  During the applicable restricted periods, however, the shares will be held by or on behalf of the Corporation. Shares under restriction may be held in certificated or book-entry form as the administrative authority determines.  Grantee agrees that the Corporation may give stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect to shares subject to restriction and that, during the applicable restricted period, any restricted shares issued in certificated form may bear an appropriate legend noting the restrictions, risk of forfeiture, and requirements regarding withholding taxes.  If and when the applicable restricted period expires with respect to any issued shares, subject to paragraph 7, the Corporation will deliver those shares promptly after such expiration to or for the account of Grantee free of restriction, either in certi ficated form or by book-entry transfer in accordance with the procedures of the administrative authority in effect at the time.
.
Form of Shares
  9.
During the applicable restricted periods, Grantee will have customary rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares registered in Grantee's name, including the rights to vote and to receive dividends on the shares, subject to the restrictions on transfer, possible events of forfeiture, and potential dividend reinvestment provided in this Agreement.  However, before the shares are registered in Grantee's name, Grantee will not be a shareholder of the Corporation and will not be entitled to dividends with respect to those shares.
.
Shareholder Status
10.
 If a stock split, stock dividend, or other relevant change in capitalization of the Corporation occurs, any resulting new shares or securities issued with respect to previously issued shares that are still restricted under this Agreement will be delivered to and held by or on behalf of the Corporation and will be subject to the same provisions, restrictions, and requirements as those previously issued shares.
.
Change in Capitalization
11.
 Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, under no circumstances will the Corporation be required to issue or deliver any shares if doing so would violate any law or listing requirement that the administrative authority determines to be applicable, or if Grantee has failed to provide for required taxes pursuant to paragraph 7.
.
Limits on the Corporation's Obligations
12.
 Grantee acknowledges receipt of or access to the full text of the Program.
.
Receipt or Access to Program
     
13.
 Grantee appoints the Corporation to be Grantee's agent to receive for Grantee dividends on shares based on record dates that occur while the shares are subject to restriction under this Agreement.  The Corporation will transmit such dividends, net of required taxes pursuant to paragraph 7, to or for the account of Grantee in such manner as the administrative authority determines.  Alternatively, the administrative authority may determine to reinvest such net dividends in additional shares which will be held subject to all the terms and conditions otherwise applicable to shares of restricted stock under this Agreement.
.
Appointment of Agent for Dividends
14.
 The Corporation's proxy statement, annual report, and other shareholder materials deliverable to Grantee with respect to shares issued under this Agreement may be delivered to Grantee electronically, unless Grantee specifically requests delivery in paper format.  Such electronic delivery may be accomplished by email transmission of the materials, or by email notification to Grantee that the materials are available at a specified website to which Grantee has access.  
.
Electronic Delivery of Shareholder Communications
15.
 To facilitate communications regarding this Agreement and electronic delivery of shareholder communications as provided in paragraph 14, Grantee will provide Grantee's current mailing and email addresses on the signature page of this Agreement and agrees to notify the Corporation promptly of changes in such information in the future.  Communications to the Corporation in connection with this Agreement should be directed to the Incentive Processing Office at the address given on the signature page of this Agreement, or to such other address as the Corporation may designate by further notice to Grantee.
.
Addresses for Communications
16.
The administration of the Program and this Agreement involves the transfer of personal data about Grantee between and among the Corporation, selected affiliates of the Corporation, and third-party service providers.  That data includes Grantee's age, contact information, work location, employment status, tax status, and related information.  Grantee authorizes the transfer of that data.
.  
Transfer of Personal Data
17.
 This Agreement, the Corporation's incentive programs, and Grantee's selection for incentive awards do not imply or form a part of any contract or assurance of employment, and they do not in any way limit or restrict the ability of Grantee's employer to terminate Grantee's employment.  Grantee acknowledges that the Corporation maintains and administers its incentive programs entirely in its discretion and that Grantee is not entitled to any other or future incentive awards of any kind in addition to those that have already been granted.

No Employment Contract or Entitlement to Other or Future Awards
