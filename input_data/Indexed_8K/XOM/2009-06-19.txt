Other Events
On June 15, 2009, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit awarded plaintiffs in the Valdez litigation interest on the $507.5 million punitive damages award from the date of the original trial court judgment in 1996.  The Court also denied the Corporation's claims to recover up to $70 million in appeal costs.  The Corporation recorded an after-tax charge of $290 million in the second quarter of 2008 with respect to the punitive damages, and recorded an after-tax charge of $170 million in the third quarter of 2008, reflecting estimated resolution of the interest and cost issues.  An additional after-tax charge of about $150 million will be recorded in the second quarter of 2009 to reflect the Court's decision.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
