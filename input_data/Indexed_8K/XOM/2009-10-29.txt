3Q09 Investor Relations Data Summary.

EXHIBIT 99.1
:
EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED
"Despite ongoing global economic weakness and reduced demand for products, we continued our robust investment program and delivered strong results.
Our third quarter earnings, excluding special items, were $4.7 billion.  While continuing to be impacted by lower commodity prices and weak product margins, we maintained our focus on operational excellence and invested $19 billion through the first three quarters of the year to develop new energy supplies.
Oil-equivalent production increased by 3% over the third quarter of 2008 with contributions from major start-ups of world-class assets including Qatargas 2, Train 5 and Ras Laffan 3, Train 6 in Qatar.
We are well-positioned for continued production growth with projects such as QatarGas, RasGas and Gorgon LNG which will contribute additional long plateau production for decades and provide ExxonMobil with a strong foundation.
ExxonMobil's industry leading financial strength has allowed us to continue to invest across the economic cycle focusing on world class opportunities.
Our commitment to a disciplined and long term focused investment strategy sets ExxonMobil apart from its competitors.  
In addition to funding our capital and operating programs, we distributed $2.0 billion in dividends and purchased $4.0 billion of ExxonMobil common stock to reduce shares outstanding during the third quarter."
THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
Earnings excluding special items were $4,730 million, a decrease of 65% or $8,650 million from the third quarter of 2008.
Earnings per share excluding special items were $0.98, a decrease of 62%.
Earnings were down 68% from the third quarter of 2008 which included a special gain of $1,620 million from the sale of a natural gas transportation business in Germany and a special charge of $170 million related to the Valdez punitive damages award. Earnings for the third quarter of 2009 did not include any special items.
Capital and exploration expenditures were $6.5 billion, down 5% from the third quarter of 2008, reflecting the impacts of a stronger U.S. dollar.
Oil-equivalent production increased nearly 3% from the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up about 5%.
Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately $9.0 billion, including asset sales of $0.2 billion.
Share purchases of $4.0 billion reduced shares outstanding by 1.2%.
Two major liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities in Qatar  Qatargas 2, Train 5 and Ras Laffan 3, Train 6  commenced production. With annual production capacity of 7.8 million tons each, both trains join Qatargas 2, Train 4 as the largest operating LNG production facilities in the world.
Participants in the Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project approved a development plan that will include three LNG processing trains with a capacity of 5 million tons per year each. The development decision followed execution of LNG sales and purchase agreements with PetroChina International Company Limited and Petronet LNG Limited of India for ExxonMobil's equity share of LNG in the project.
Fujian Refining and Petrochemical Company Limited announced the startup of new chemical units  including an ethylene steam cracker, a polyethylene unit, a polypropylene unit and aromatics facilities  in its new fully integrated refining and petrochemical complex in Fujian Province, China.  
ExxonMobil announced an alliance with leading biotech company, Synthetic Genomics Inc., to research and develop next generation biofuels from photosynthetic algae. If research and development milestones are met, ExxonMobil expects to spend more than $600 million under the program.
 
Third Quarter 2009 vs. Third Quarter 2008
Upstream earnings, excluding special items, were $4,012 million down $5,339 million from the third quarter of 2008.  Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations accounted for the majority of the decline, reducing earnings approximately $4.9 billion while higher operating costs reduced earnings approximately $300 million.  
On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased nearly 3% from the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up about 5%.
Liquids production totaled 2,335 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), up 45 kbd from the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was up over 5%, as increased production from projects in the United States and Kazakhstan was partly offset by field decline.
Third quarter natural gas production was 8,129 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), up 309 mcfd from 2008.New production volumes from project additions in Qatar and the United States were partly offset by maintenance in Europe.
 
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $709 million, $1,170 million lower than the third quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings, excluding special items, were $3,303 million, down $4,169 million from last year.
Downstream earnings of $325 million were down $2,688 million from the third quarter of 2008. Lower refining margins drove the decline, reducing earnings $2.6 billion. Petroleum product sales of 6,301 kbd were 387 kbd lower than last year's third quarter, mainly reflecting asset sales and lower demand.
The U.S. Downstream recorded a loss of $203 million, down $1,181 million from the third quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $528 million were $1,507 million lower than last year.
Chemical earnings of $876 million were $211 million lower than the third quarter of 2008.  Weaker margins drove the decline, reducing earnings $170 million. Third quarter
prime product sales of 6,356 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 296 kt higher than the prior year primarily due to the absence of last year's hurricane impacts.
Corporate and financing expenses excluding special items were $483 million, up $412 million due mainly to lower interest income.
During the third quarter of 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 61 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $4.2 billion. These purchases included $4.0 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans and programs.  Shares outstanding were reduced from 4,806 million at the end of the second quarter to 4,747 million at the end of the third quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
First Nine Months 2009 vs. First Nine Months 2008
Earnings of $13,230 million ($2.71 per share) decreased $24,170 million from 2008.  Excluding special items, earnings for the first nine months of 2009 were $13,370 million, a decrease of $22,870 million from 2008.

Cautionary statement
Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking statements.  Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in long-term oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas industry; completion of repair projects as planned; unforeseen technical difficulties; political events or disturbances; reservoir performance; the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2008 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date. References to qua ntities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as "proved reserves" under SEC definitions.
Frequently used terms
Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.  Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods.  Reconciliation to net income attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.  The release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales.  Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II.  Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other t erms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available through the Investors section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
Accounting guidance adopted in first quarter 2009
Effective January 1, 2009, ExxonMobil adopted the authoritative guidance on consolidation as it relates to noncontrolling interests.  The guidance changed the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which were recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity.  The guidance required retrospective adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests.  All other requirements will be applied prospectively.  The adoption of the accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Corporation's financial statements.
References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.  Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, special items, earnings excluding special items, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Effective January 1, 2009, ExxonMobil adopted the authoritative guidance for earnings per share as it relates to determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities.  The guidance required that all unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends should be included in the basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) calculation.  Prior-year EPS numbers have been adjusted retrospectively on a consistent basis with 2009 reporting.  This guidance did not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations.
