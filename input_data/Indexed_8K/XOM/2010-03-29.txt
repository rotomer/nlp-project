Safety, Security, Health & Environment
ExxonMobil remains steadfast in our commitment to excellence in safety, security, health, and environmental (SSH&E) performance. We continue to deliver results that demonstrate that commitment.
2009 HIGHLIGHTS
Guiding Principles
ExxonMobil is committed to conducting business in a manner that protects the safety, security, and health of our employees, those involved with our operations, our customers, and the public. We are committed to conducting business in a manner that is compatible with the environmental and economic needs of the communities in which we operate. These commitments are documented in our safety, health, environmental, and product safety policies that are put into practice through a disciplined management framework called the Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).
All operating organizations are required to maintain the systems and practices needed to conform to the expectations described in the OIMS framework. To drive continuous improvement, the framework is periodically updated. The latest revision, completed in 2009, strengthens framework expectations with respect to leadership, process safety, environmental performance, and the assessment of OIMS effectiveness. With this revision, we seek to:
Since the inception of OIMS, our SSH&E performance has improved substantially. We continue to lead the industry with our low incident rates for work-related injuries and illnesses. Risks to the environment have been reduced, with a significant decline in marine spills and continuing reductions in emissions. We are proud of these achievements and remain committed to maintaining and improving these high levels of performance.
We have been cited by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance (LRQA) for "being among the leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into our ongoing business practices." We are
pleased that in 2009, LRQA recognized OIMS as meeting all requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series for health and safety management systems (OHSAS 18001:1999) and the International Organization for Standardization's specification for environmental management systems (ISO 14001:2004).
Working Toward an Incident-Free Workplace
At ExxonMobil, excellence in safety and health in the workplace is a core value. Our approach to safety and health management is yielding good results. Since 2000, we have reduced our workforce lost-time incidents by an average of over 14 percent per year and achieved best-ever performance for combined employee and contractor workforce incident rates in 2009. However, we are saddened to report that in 2009 we had eight workforce fatalities. We will not be satisfied until we have achieved a workplace in which .
Nobody Gets Hurt
ExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to the protection of our people, facilities, information, and other assets leading each business to reinforce the importance of security. Through the initiative, we continue to stress awareness of security-related issues, from site security to cyber security.
Security is Everybody's Business
We believe that a successful business relies on a healthy workforce  and we take seriously those health issues that impact our workforce  whether work-related or not. By providing voluntary health promotion programs designed to enhance employees' well-being, productivity, and personal safety, we aim to improve the health of our workforce.
We also maintain an active commitment to the communities in which we work. We believe that self-sustaining improvements in public health are a key enabler for broader economic and social gains.

Managing Risk
Operational excellence, enduring business controls, and high standards for the conduct of our business are hallmarks of ExxonMobil and fundamental to our approach to risk management.
Many of our operations and products present potential risks to people and to the environment, and we recognize that these risks are inherent in our business. We believe the best way to effectively manage these risks is through clearly defined policies, standards, and practices embedded in rigorously applied management systems designed to deliver results.
Business continuity planning and emergency preparedness are two elements that help us address risk. We place great emphasis on preparedness to help ensure an effective response to incidents. Response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus was coordinated across ExxonMobil businesses utilizing business continuity plans developed in prior years.
Reducing Environmental Impact
ExxonMobil recognizes that by reducing the environmental impact of today's energy, we are taking an important step toward a more sustainable future. It is our objective to operate responsibly everywhere we do business by implementing scientifically sound, practical solutions that consider the needs of the communities in which we operate. Our goal is to eliminate incidents with real environmental impact.
To that end, our environmental management processes are guided by our initiative, which outlines our expectations for being an industry leader in environmental protection.
Protect Tomorrow. Today.
Balancing Energy Production with Water Scarcity
Natural gas is expected to be the fastest-growing major fuel source, driven largely by its increased use to generate electricity. ExxonMobil's leases in the Piceance Basin in Colorado hold a potential recoverable resource of more than 45 trillion cubic feet of gas. This major resource will take years to produce, and ExxonMobil is committed to increasing natural gas production more efficiently and with less environmental impact.
Producing natural gas from the Piceance Basin has a number of challenges. This gas is trapped within rock much tighter than concrete and requires the injection of a high-pressure mixture of sand and water to allow the gas to flow. In some areas of the western United States, water availability can be limited and is a strategic issue that the oil and gas industry is addressing.
Water conservation is a top priority for our operations, and we are actively engaged in managing water use. Our approaches include technological and operational innovations to enhance water use efficiency and improve water quality. For example, formation water produced with gas can be treated and reused elsewhere for other processes. As we continue to improve our use of produced water in our operations, we expect to reduce our freshwater usage by about 70 to 80 percent over the next few years in our Piceance Basin operations.
We have also significantly reduced the amount of water required for the production of oil at our Cold Lake operations in Canada. Through efforts to recover and treat water, we are now able to recycle 95 percent of the water at this in situ heavy oil project.

Through this initiative, we set goals to improve performance and drive incidents with real environmental impact to zero. Progress toward these goals is managed through Environmental Business Planning, which integrates environmental improvement efforts with other business plans.
Through strong environmental management, our businesses have made major improvements in environmental performance. For example, since 2004, we have reduced total oil spills greater than one barrel by about 50 percent. In 2009, we had zero spills from company-owned and
performance throughout our facilities worldwide. Since 2004, we have invested $1.9 billion in activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency in our operations. In addition, we are spending more than $5 billion in gas utilization and commercialization projects to reduce routine natural gas flaring.
We are also investing in cogeneration, which provides significant environmental benefits because it uses less fuel and produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional power generation. ExxonMobil has interests in about 4.9 gigawatts of cogeneration capacity in
operated marine vessels in ExxonMobil's service.
Managing Climate Change Risks
No discussion of environmental performance would be complete without talking about the risks of climate change. We have the same concerns as people everywhere  and that is how to provide the world with the energy it needs while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
more than 30 locations worldwide. These operations have the capacity to produce enough electricity to supply the needs of more than 2 million U.S. homes.
Since the launch of our Global Energy Management System in 2000, we have identified opportunities to improve energy efficiency by 15 to 20 percent at our refineries and chemical plants and have already implemented over 60
We take the issue of climate change seriously and the risks warrant action. Our strategy to achieve reductions in GHG emissions is focused on increasing our own energy efficiency and reducing flaring in the short term; advancing current proven emissions-reducing technologies in the medium term; and developing breakthrough, game-changing technologies for long-term emissions reduction. These initiatives will reduce emissions generated both internally by our own operations and externally by our customers.
Internally, new energy efficiency technologies and day-to-day operational efficiency activities generate significant energy savings and reduce GHG emissions. ExxonMobil has systematically worked to improve efficiency and environmental
percent of these. Across our operations, we are working to reduce flaring of gas. In 2009, we reduced Upstream hydrocarbon flaring by about 23 percent.
Steps taken in these programs since 2005 have resulted in reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of more than 8 million tonnes in 2009, the equivalent of removing 1.7 million cars from U.S. roads.
Researching Technologies to Reduce Emissions
We also believe that it is critically important  and ultimately most effective  to invest in research for fundamentally new technologies and innovative approaches that will be efficient in reducing future emissions. Technology is the single element that is common to all efforts to attain our energy and environmental goals. ExxonMobil is a world leader in carbon management technologies, and has researched and developed carbon-handling technologies for more than 30 years.
We have an active portfolio of research in a wide range of future technologies, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen production, biomass conversion, and algae.
We launched a biofuels program with leading genomics innovator, Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI) to research and develop next-generation biofuels from photosynthetic algae. We believe that biofuel produced by algae has the potential to be an economically viable transportation fuel with low net emissions of greenhouse gases.
We are also a founding sponsor of the Global Climate and Energy Project (GCEP) at Stanford University, a pioneering research effort to identify potentially game-changing, breakthrough science to reduce GHG emissions.

Developing Potential Breakthrough Technologies
Meeting the world's long-term energy needs while also protecting the environment will require integrated solutions that include developing all economic energy sources. In the years to come, oil and natural gas will continue supplying the majority of our energy because they are scalable, affordable, and versatile. But alternatives and next-generation fuels  like those made from algae  could also play important roles.
ExxonMobil has entered into a research and development alliance with Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI), founded by genome pioneer, J. Craig Venter, Ph.D., to develop advanced biofuels from photosynthetic algae that are compatible with today's gasoline and diesel fuels.
The potential advantages and benefits of biofuels from algae could be significant. One advantage is that growing algae does not rely on fresh water and farmable land that could be used for food production. In addition, algae offer the potential to yield greater quantities of biofuels per acre of production than food crop-based biofuel sources. Since photosynthetic algae consume carbon dioxide as they grow, algae-based biofuels could provide greenhouse gas mitigation benefits versus conventional fuels. In addition, algae have the potential to produce large volumes of oils that can be processed in existing refineries to manufacture fuels that are compatible with existing transportation systems and infrastructure.
The alliance between SGI and ExxonMobil will bring together the complementary capabilities and expertise of both companies to develop innovative solutions that could lead to the large-scale production of biofuels from algae.
While significant work and years of research and development still must be completed, if successful, algae-based fuels could help meet the world's growing demand for transportation fuel without increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Under the program, if research and development milestones are successfully met, ExxonMobil expects to spend more than $600 million.
The algae biofuels program is one of several ExxonMobil efforts to advance breakthrough technologies. This program complements ExxonMobil's ongoing efforts to reduce emissions from our operations and from consumer use of our products, through both efficiency improvements and technology breakthroughs.

The Outlook for Energy  A View to 2030
In our , we see significant opportunities for economic growth, improved living standards, and exciting new energy technologies. But we also see tremendous challenges: how to meet the world's growing energy needs to support and expand prosperity for people, while also reducing the impact of energy use on the environment.
Outlook for Energy  A View to 2030
In considering these challenges, our takes a comprehensive look at long-term trends in energy demand, supply, emissions, and technology. ExxonMobil uses the to guide our long-term investment decisions. We also share it publicly to encourage a better understanding of the scale and nature of global energy challenges.
Outlook for Energy
Outlook
Meeting Key Energy Challenges
Our energy future is about people improving their daily lives and countries advancing through different stages of economic development and progress. Expanding access to energy  and the opportunities it affords  is a common goal around the world.
Meeting this challenge with reliable, affordable energy will not be easy, recognizing that increasing populations and economic prosperity will push global energy demand almost 35 percent higher by 2030 versus 2005. This means the industry will need to invest and operate on a scale even larger than today.
At the same time, we need to manage risks to our environment and take sensible steps to curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We also need to utilize local resources and promote trade to help maintain secure supplies.
Solutions to these challenges require a variety of approaches to expand supplies, improve efficiency, and mitigate emissions. These solutions will require trillions of dollars in new energy investment, a long-term focus, and constant technological innovation.
Prosperity and Energy Remain Linked
The evolution of energy and technology has enabled people in many countries to achieve a modern lifestyle in which access to energy is largely taken for granted. But in many parts of the world, the challenge is far more basic, as billions of people still lack access to electricity and modern fuels for cooking and heating.
Our begins with an assessment of how, where, and to what extent energy is used today to support people and their economic activities. Looking ahead, despite the recent recession, the long-term economic trend is encouraging. We expect global gross domestic product (GDP)  will expand at an average annual rate of 2.7 percent from 2005 through 2030.
Outlook
In non-OECD countries  even with significant gains in energy efficiency  we expect rapid economic growth to produce a steep climb in energy demand. In fact, between 2005 and 2030, non-OECD energy demand will grow about 65 percent.
By contrast, in OECD countries, energy demand will be essentially flat through 2030 even though economic output will increase more than 50 percent on average. This demand profile will be driven by substantial improvements in efficiency.
In fact, one of the most important "fuels" of all is energy efficiency. The energy saved by improved efficiency will be larger in 2030 than from any other single source, including oil.
Transportation Demand Reflects Efficiency and Prosperity
Transportation is one of the most visible activities requiring energy today. Moving people and goods across cities, across regions, and around the world will continue to require substantial energy.
At the same time, we anticipate many shifts will occur within the transportation sector. For example, trends within the largest sub-sector  light-duty vehicles (cars, SUVs, and light pickup trucks)  will change dramatically. Through 2030, global energy demand from light-duty vehicles is expected to flatten as more efficient vehicles enter the market.

In contrast, energy for heavy-duty vehicles (trucks and buses) will grow significantly, reflecting economic growth and the increased shipment of goods. By 2030, heavy-duty vehicles will become the largest transportation demand segment. Over the outlook period, aviation and marine transport also will grow significantly, reflecting expanding prosperity and trade.
We classify transportation into two categories  personal transport (such as cars) and commercial transport. Over the outlook period, we see significant shifts in personal transport as OECD demand is expected to drop by 25 percent by 2030, while non-OECD demand more than doubles. Why is this? In OECD economies, where vehicles-per-capita is already high, better fuel economy over time will more than offset additional demand created by a growing fleet. However, in non-OECD countries, rapid growth in personal vehicle ownership will cause personal transport energy demand to rise dramatically.
Commercial transportation demand will grow significantly in all regions, but far more rapidly in non-OECD countries. Between 2005 and 2030, these fast-developing nations will have overtaken the OECD as the largest source of commercial transportation demand and will account for all of the growth in global transportation demand.
Rising Electricity Demand Drives Power Generation
Growing demand for electricity and the fuels used for power generation will continue to be a major trend. By 2030, global electricity demand will be about four times higher than in 1980. As a result, power generation will remain not only the largest energy-demand sector, but will also be the fastest-growing sector. Over the outlook period, this sector alone will contribute about 55 percent of the total growth in energy demand.
This remarkable increase in energy demand for power generation will be driven not only by the high-tech demands of the developed world, but also by the basic needs and

12
rapid economic growth of the developing world. From 2005 to 2030, non-OECD nations will account for nearly 80 percent of worldwide growth in electricity demand.
We also anticipate there will be a shift away from coal toward less carbon-intensive fuels including natural gas, nuclear, and renewable fuels. This shift will be driven by economics and national policies, including those that seek to reduce emissions by establishing a direct cost on GHG emissions. By 2030, we expect 40 percent of the world's electricity will be generated by nuclear and renewable fuels.
Global Energy Demand and Supply Increasing
Through 2030, the global energy demand picture will be shaped by economic expansion and progress, particularly in non-OECD countries. Even with dramatic gains in efficiency, we expect global energy demand will rise 1.2 percent a year on average.
Fossil fuels  oil, natural gas, and coal  will continue to meet most of the world's needs  accounting for nearly 80 percent of demand. No other energy sources can match their availability, versatility, affordability, and scale.
Oil will still account for the largest share, but natural gas will move into second place on very strong growth, driven by increasing power generation needs and the ability of natural gas to serve as a reliable, affordable, and clean-burning energy source. From 2005 to 2030, global demand for natural gas will increase about 55 percent. Nuclear power will also grow significantly to help meet rising electricity demand.
Wind, solar, and biofuels will grow most rapidly through 2030, at nearly 10 percent a year on average. However, starting from a small base, their contribution by 2030 will remain relatively small at about 2.5 percent of total energy.
In total, we expect global energy demand will rise by almost 35 percent from 2005 to 2030, with essentially all this growth occurring in non-OECD countries. Energy saved through efficiency gains will reach about twice the growth in global energy demand through 2030.
Meeting the Growing Worldwide Need for Liquid Fuels
The world's liquid fuels supply comprises mostly crude oil, but also includes condensate, natural gas liquids, and biofuels. Liquid fuels will remain especially important for meeting projected strong growth in transportation demand. Nearly all the world's transportation runs on liquid fuels because they provide a large quantity of energy in small volumes, making them easy to transport and widely available.
Meeting this demand has important implications for potential sources of supply. Supplies of all liquids excluding OPEC crude are projected to reach about 67 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2030, including about 3 million barrels per day from biofuels. The gap between these supplies and total liquids demand  known as the "call on OPEC crude"  is expected to expand to about 37 million oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2030.
Overall, the increase in liquids supply needed in 2030 will be met by non-OPEC and OPEC liquids in nearly equal share. Meeting this demand in an economic and environmentally sound manner is an ongoing priority of the industry. It will require large investments to maximize yields from mature fields as they naturally decline, and to develop new sources of supplies in existing development areas as well as promising new regions.

Natural Gas to Meet a Rising Share of Energy Needs
Natural gas will meet a growing share of the world's energy needs through 2030. Given its abundance and properties as a clean-burning fuel, expanded use of natural gas can serve economic progress and help advance environmental goals.
Total natural gas demand in the United States and Europe will follow a similar pattern, with modest growth through 2030. In contrast, Asia Pacific demand will grow much more rapidly, at almost 4 percent per year on average.
An important supply development has been the expansion of unconventional natural gas  the result of recent improvements in technologies used to tap these hard-to-produce resources. This is particularly the case in the United States, where unconventional sources are expected to satisfy more than 50 percent of gas demand in 2030. In Europe, local natural gas production continues to decline, driving imports from about 45 percent of total supply in 2005 to about 70 percent in 2030. In Asia Pacific, domestic natural gas production continues to climb, but at a slower pace than demand. As a result, Asia Pacific will need to rely more heavily on gas imports. Common to all these areas will be the need for liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports to meet growing demand through 2030.
Growing Global Energy Demand and CO Emissions
2
The outlook for energy-related carbon dioxide (CO) emissions is linked directly to the types and amounts of energy required globally. In our view, global CO emissions are likely to rise about 25 percent from 2005 to 2030. While significant, that increase is substantially lower than the projected growth in energy demand. This outlook reflects substantial efficiency gains, as well as a shift over time to a significantly less carbon-intensive energy mix.
2
2
Importantly, because countries are at different stages in their economic development, the outlook for CO emissions varies greatly between OECD and non-OECD countries.
2
Non-OECD emissions surpassed OECD emissions in 2004. By 2030, non-OECD countries will account for two-thirds of the global total.
This outcome reflects our view that CO emissions in the OECD have already peaked and will decline by about 15 percent by 2030, reaching a level similar to that in 1980. This will be a noteworthy achievement considering that OECD economic output will have tripled from 1980 to 2030 and population will have grown by about 30 percent.
2
Providing Integrated Solutions
The scale of our economic, energy, and environmental challenges is huge and growing. To achieve significant scale, solutions to these challenges must make sense for investors and consumers. Further, to satisfy broad and diverse needs around the world, solutions must also be affordable, versatile, and efficient.
As an integrated set of solutions, we must pursue three key elements related to energy:

Technology
Technology is vital to meeting the world's growing demand for energy. ExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to fundamental research to develop and grow our technological capabilities and to deliver advantaged technologies for all of our businesses.
UPSTREAM TECHNOLOGY
ExxonMobil is committed to investing in a broad range of proprietary technologies that provide a competitive advantage in exploration, project development, oil and gas recovery, and production operations. Application of these technologies maximizes the value of the resource and results in safer operations, reduced exploration risks, improved drilling and well performance, greater hydrocarbon recovery, and lower costs.
Satellite Mapping for Carbonate Reservoir Modeling
ExxonMobil's innovative approach to mapping environments where carbonate rocks are being formed today is contributing to better models of carbonate reservoirs. We are applying spectral-analysis techniques to satellite images to produce high-resolution maps of modern carbonate sediments around the globe. This approach provides extensive, detailed information for use in predicting carbonate rock types in the subsurface, especially in areas where well and seismic data provide insufficient information for modeling. The knowledge gained from satellite-image analysis contributes to better predictions of reservoir performance, which in turn, enhance our ability to target exploration opportunities and to optimize development and production strategies in carbonate settings.
Satellite-image analysis of modern carbonate environments helps guide the distribution of different rock types (colored layers) in 3D models used to predict reservoir performance.
High-Resolution Imaging of Shale Pore Networks
ExxonMobil is using state-of-the-art electron microscopy to understand pore networks in shale gas reservoirs, which are an important and growing source of new natural gas supplies. High-resolution imaging of specially prepared rock samples has resolved shale pores as small as a billionth of a meter in size. The resulting images enable geologists and engineers to investigate how gas is stored in shales and how it flows in rocks previously regarded only as seals or source rocks. The high-resolution images serve as the basis for quantifying the porosity, permeability, and physical properties of shales, and provide critical calibration for how shale gas reservoirs will produce. This technology will enhance ExxonMobil's ability to effectively explore and develop these challenging new resources.
High-resolution electron microscope imaging is used to study the structure of shale gas reservoirs, an increasingly important source of natural gas production. Shale pores can be as small as one-billionth of a meter in size.

Advanced Seismic Imaging
Advances in seismic imaging are critical to finding and producing the world's remaining hydrocarbon reserves. ExxonMobil's leading-edge seismic imaging technologies are providing more accurate representations of the subsurface in structurally complex areas, such as below salt or in highly folded and faulted regions. These sophisticated imaging approaches utilize algorithms that incorporate a realistic simulation of the way seismic waves propagate through the subsurface. The resulting high-fidelity images will play a key role in enhancing decisions as our exploration, development, and production efforts progress into more challenging geologic settings.
ExxonMobil's leading-edge seismic processing technology provides a more accurate image of the subsurface below salt bodies.
High-Performance Computing
ExxonMobil's new high-performance computing system is enabling the development of leading-edge technology for geophysical imaging. ExxonMobil worked with IBM to install this system of 24,000 processors for the Upstream Research Company during 2009. This computing capability is a critical requirement for using all of the energy recorded in seismic surveys and creating much more accurate images of the subsurface. These images will be used to reduce risk in our exploration, development, and production operations.
A new, high-performance computing system has been installed to provide the computational power for leading-edge geophysical technology.
New Trace Element Analytical Capabilities
ExxonMobil's state-of-the-art trace element laboratory provides high-resolution analyses that impact business decisions in many aspects of our Upstream operations.
ExxonMobil has installed a new, state-of-the-art laboratory for the measurement of trace elements in oil, water, and rocks. The laboratory's high-resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) can resolve the concentration of a wide variety of trace elements, such as vanadium, nickel, and cobalt, at the parts-per-trillion level. Trace element signatures in oil and water assist in determining connectivity between individual reservoir compartments, which helps guide the optimal placement of development wells. In addition, the trace element content of oil, water, and rocks can play a key role in predicting how reservoirs will produce over time.

"Inside the Well" Experimental Capabilities
ExxonMobil uses state-of-the-art experimental capabilities at our new Well Performance Laboratory to optimize the long-term productivity and reliability of our wells. A unique Polyaxial Rock Stress Cell and advanced fluid-flow simulators put researchers "inside the well" to gain insights into the dynamic interactions between rocks, fluids, and pipes. Large-scale rock samples are exposed to realistic down-hole stresses to investigate rock failure and its effect on well performance, and a laser assembly continuously maps the interior surface of simulated wellbores in the samples. This improved fundamental understanding will contribute to more reliable and productive wells, enabling ExxonMobil to successfully manage hydrocarbon production in increasingly complex operating environments.

Enhanced Bitumen Recovery
At Cold Lake, in Alberta, Canada, we are piloting an enhanced process for recovering bitumen. The Solvent-Assisted, Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SA-SAGD) process improves upon ExxonMobil's widely applied thermal SAGD technology by using a solvent, in addition to steam, to further lower bitumen viscosity and accelerate production. Laboratory experiments and computer simulations indicate that SA-SAGD also has the potential to significantly reduce water and energy requirements for bitumen recovery. The SA-SAGD pilot at Cold Lake is designed to confirm these benefits at the field scale. If successful, this process has commercial applicability for recovering bitumen from extensive oil sands deposits in Canada.
In SA-SAGD, steam and solvent (red and yellow) injected into the subsurface from an upper well create a steam chamber and accelerate the flow of bitumen (green) to a production well below.
Oil Shale Recovery Tests

Researchers measure voltages in an
oil shale heating experiment at ExxonMobil's Colony Mine in Colorado.
ExxonMobil is developing our process for subsurface conversion of the kerogen present in oil shale to hydrocarbons, and research has progressed to field testing. The process heats oil shale underground by creating a hydraulic fracture in the rock and filling it with an electrically conductive material to form a resistive heating element. Tests of the process conducted in 2009 at our Colony Mine in northwestern Colorado verified the functionality of the technique in a low-temperature heating experiment. Oil shale is a significant unconventional resource, and the process has the potential for recovery in deep, thick formations with less surface disturbance and at lower cost than other methods. Research and development will continue pursuing full demonstration of the technical, environmental, and economic feasibility of this breakthrough technology.

Preventing Hydrate Formation
This testing equipment was installed at the West Pembina field in Canada to conduct a field trial of ExxonMobil's proprietary ColdFlow technology, which combats the formation of hydrates.
In very cold conditions, hydrates  solid structures containing water molecules  can clog production flow lines. Production conditions in extreme deepwater or arctic environments make standard hydrate management methods technically complex and expensive. ExxonMobil has developed an innovative, reliable solution that assures hydrate flow without the need for chemicals or insulation. Specially designed inserts called static mixers work in the flow lines to produce small hydrate particles, which can move freely without clumping or sticking to pipe walls, thereby assuring unrestricted flow. After successful laboratory testing, a field trial is now under way at the West Pembina field in northern Canada. This ColdFlow technology could significantly lower the cost and complexity of future deepwater and arctic developments.
Improved Corrosion Prevention
ExxonMobil is a leader in applying corrosion-control technology to ensure the safety and integrity of our operations and assets. Understanding the environment inside pipelines is critical for achieving this goal. To address this challenge, ExxonMobil is using a customized camera specially designed to withstand exposure to very high pressure, highly corrosive gas, and a wide temperature range. The camera is inserted into our full-scale corrosion flow loop and allows engineers to observe the fluids in realistic pipeline conditions. These direct observations of fluid behavior are used to improve the physical basis of our leading-edge corrosion models and to help optimize operating practices that reduce the risk of corrosion in pipelines.
Our unique Materials and Corrosion Laboratory develops advanced corrosion-control technologies by simulating and directly observing flow inside pipelines.
Innovative Sour Gas Processing

ExxonMobil's innovative () technology will undergo commercial-scale qualification in a new demonstration plant that is being commissioned at our LaBarge facility in Wyoming. technology utilizes a single-step, cryogenic process to more efficiently separate carbon dioxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (HS) from sour natural gas, and has a much smaller footprint than current technologies. The process has the potential to allow economic development of gas resources challenged by CO and HS content by reducing the costs of removing these impurities. It could also enable CO sequestration at a lower cost. The process discharges CO and HS as a high-pressure liquid, thus reducing power and equipment requirements for subsequent injection into underground storage. The new demonstration plant will process a variety of gas feed streams representative of sour gas resources worldwide.

DOWNSTREAM TECHNOLOGY
ExxonMobil's Downstream research and technology portfolio encompasses a broad range of activities addressing both near-and long-term business needs. Our base business initiatives are focused on developing and deploying high-impact technologies that maximize the value of our existing assets and provide competitive advantage. Longer-term research efforts are aimed at identifying game-changing technologies that will allow us to sustain competitive advantage in both conventional downstream and new emerging areas.
Increasing Diesel Production
Diesel demand is projected to increase from 2009 to 2030 in all regions around the world. ExxonMobil is actively working on a variety of technologies aimed at improving refinery flexibility, thus enabling rapid response to changing product demands.
Technology solutions for the near term include applying our engineering best practices to debottleneck refinery units, using our proprietary Molecule Management technology to optimize distillation and conversion unit operations, and selecting the appropriate catalysts to obtain optimal performance at minimal cost. For example, we are applying our Real Time Optimization (RTO) technology, which uses our proprietary process models, to set unit operating conditions that enhance margins.
We continually evaluate new applications of proven proprietary technologies. One example is the use of ExxonMobil's Isomerization Dewaxing catalyst in distillate hydrotreating and hydrocracking units to allow processing of heavier feeds. catalyst technology enables higher diesel yields while still meeting increasingly stringent product specifications. We are also actively developing longer-term step-out technology options. For example, one proprietary technology under development uses an integrated thermal and catalytic cracking process to produce significantly higher distillate yields and improved distillate qualities relative to conventional Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) technology.

Advanced Modeling
ExxonMobil continues to evaluate new applications of advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling to improve performance and capture value in all process areas within our Downstream, Upstream, and Chemical operations. Modern computers and CFD software coupled with proprietary models allow us to better understand hydrodynamics, heat transfer, and reactivity in process vessels such as distillation towers and reactors.
We are using CFD modeling to design fixed-bed reactors and improve their performance and reliability. For example, CFD analysis of a fixed-bed hydrotreating unit at an ExxonMobil Americas manufacturing site improved understanding of gas/liquid flow distribution and catalyst utilization in the reactor. This work enabled improved designs of reactor internal components, reducing liquid bypassing and increasing reactor productivity. The improved technology will be applied to other fixed-bed reactors in ExxonMobil facilities.

Heavy Oil Characterization
Advanced analytical technology enables detailed compositional models of heavy crude oil.
The world's heavier petroleum reserves often contain greater concentrations of complex molecules and contaminants that make their processing more challenging. ExxonMobil is using advanced analytical techniques to characterize these heavy crude oils at the molecular level. We have used the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR-MS), an analytical instrument with ultra-high mass resolution, to identify detailed petroleum asphaltene compositions in the high boiling end of crude oil. Using the information derived from these advanced analytical techniques, we are developing models of composition for various heavy oil feeds which will enable more effective processing and utilization of these materials.
Advanced Engines and Fuels
ExxonMobil is contributing to the development of advanced internal combustion engine and fuel systems with the long-term goal of achieving significant improvement in fuel economy and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our portfolio of programs ranges from advanced combustion concepts such as controlled auto-ignition to new hydrogen generation systems for fuel cell vehicles.
In collaboration with partners in industry and the research community, ExxonMobil is jointly developing an innovative, compact and efficient on-board hydrogen generation system for fuel cell vehicles. This system would catalytically convert gasoline, diesel or biofuels to fuel-cell-ready hydrogen onboard the vehicle. This offers an alternative to expensive construction of hydrogen fueling infrastructure and the use of high pressure hydrogen storage on the vehicle. Measured on a well-to-wheels basis, this system could be 80 percent more fuel efficient and emit 45 percent less carbon dioxide (CO) than today's automobiles. We are focusing on industrial applications in the near term with the long-term research goal being application in passenger vehicles.

Identify and Selectively Pursue the Highest-Quality Exploration Opportunities
ExxonMobil's exploration strategy is to identify, evaluate, pursue, and capture the highest-quality resource opportunities at the lowest cost in industry. The strength of our global organization allows us to explore for and capture all resource types regardless of life cycle, across all geological and geographical environments, using industry-leading technology and capabilities. These opportunities include:
ExxonMobil's disciplined, systematic exploration process consistently delivers an industry-leading portfolio of highly prospective opportunities that provide long-term resource additions and organic production growth. Our global approach ensures a broad exposure to high-quality opportunities, from conventional by-the-bit exploration to discovered resources that may be integrated with other business lines. The combination of world-class technical expertise and an extensive global exploration database provides a distinct competitive advantage in the identification, evaluation, pursuit, and capture of new opportunities.
We use our unique geoscience capabilities and understanding of the global hydrocarbon endowment to identify and prioritize all quality resources. Once identified, opportunities are assessed and screened on a rigorous, globally consistent basis for technical and economic viability, as well as materiality. Only the most robust opportunities are selected for further evaluation and investment. Our systematic approach to exploration has resulted in the successful capture of numerous new, high-potential resource opportunities each year. In 2009, ExxonMobil successfully captured new opportunities in nine countries.
At year-end 2009, ExxonMobil's net exploration acreage totaled 72 million acres in 33 countries. Since 2005, our total exploration acreage has increased by approximately 7 percent. This strong acreage position provides a high-quality, geographically and geologically diverse portfolio of opportunities to underpin future resource additions and production growth.

RESOURCES
In 2009, ExxonMobil added 2.9 billion oil-equivalent barrels to the resource base. After accounting for production, asset sales, and revisions to existing fields, the resource base increased by 2.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in 2009, bringing our resource base total to 75 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Proved reserves make up 31 percent of our resource base.
The industry-leading size, diversity, and quality of ExxonMobil's resource base is a major source of competitive advantage for the Corporation and is the largest among our competitors. The success of ExxonMobil's global strategy for opportunity identification, evaluation, pursuit, and capture is demonstrated by the addition of an average of 3.1 billion oil-equivalent barrels of resource per year over the past five years.
The resource base is updated annually for new discoveries and resource additions, and to reflect changes in estimates of existing resources. Changes to existing resources may result from new drilling or from revisions to forecast recovery estimates achieved through the use of new technology. Updates may also occur due to fiscal regime changes, revisions in equity for existing assets, modifications to depletion plans, and from ongoing geoscience and engineering evaluations. Volumes produced or sold during the year are removed from the resource base at year end.
In 2009, significant resource additions came from unconventional resources, with key contributions from shale gas and heavy oil in North America, and exploration drilling offshore West Africa and Australia. Effective use of ExxonMobil's proprietary processes and best practices has resulted in continued low finding and resource-acquisition costs. In 2009, finding and resource-acquisition costs were $1.54 per oil-equivalent barrel. The five-year average finding and resource-acquisition cost is $0.85 per oil-equivalent barrel.

PROVED RESERVES
At year-end 2009, our resource base included 23.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved oil and gas reserves, equating to 16 years of reserves life at current production rates. These reserves are evenly distributed between liquids and gas, and represent a diverse, global portfolio.
In 2009, ExxonMobil replaced 133 percent of reserves produced, including asset sales, by adding 2.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels to proved reserves while producing 1.5 billion net oil-equivalent barrels. Key reserves additions came from our operations in Australia, Papua New Guinea, West Africa, Canada, and the United States. Excluding asset sales, ExxonMobil replaced 134 percent of reserves in 2009  the 16th consecutive year in which we have more than replaced our production with new proved reserves.
ExxonMobil has added 8.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels to proved reserves over the last five years. In that time frame, the development of new fields and extensions of existing fields have added an average of 1.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels per year to proved reserves. Revisions have averaged about 0.7 billion oil-equivalent barrels per year over the last five years, driven by effective reservoir management and the application of new technology.
Proved reserves in this report are determined on ExxonMobil's basis using the same price and cost assumptions that we use to make investment decisions. Under SEC rules, proved reserves are determined using historical market prices. ExxonMobil has a rigorous and structured reserves review process that is stewarded by a team of experienced experts with global responsibility.
PRODUCTION VOLUMES
ExxonMobil's 2009 net oil-equivalent production of 3.9 million barrels per day was up slightly compared to 2008. Liquids production was 2.4 million barrels per day, and net natural gas production available for sale totaled nearly 9.3 billion cubic feet per day. Excluding entitlement volume effects, quota impacts, and divestments, net oil-equivalent production was up approximately 1.6 percent, primarily due to new project volumes in Qatar, Africa, and North America.
Looking ahead, new projects and work programs are expected to more than offset production declines in existing fields. Near-term production growth will be driven by large gas projects in Qatar. Longer-term growth will be supported by a diverse portfolio of projects across the globe, many of which have extended plateau production profiles that run for decades.
The forward-looking projections of production volumes in this document are reflective of our best assumptions regarding technical, commercial, and regulatory aspects of existing operations and new projects. Factors that could have an impact on actual volumes include project start-up timing, regulatory changes, quotas, asset sales, operational outages, severe weather, and entitlement volume effects under certain production sharing contracts and royalty agreements.

Capitalize on Growing Natural Gas and Power Markets
Reliable economic supplies of natural gas and power are fundamental to the world's economic growth. ExxonMobil employs a worldwide team of commercial experts, with detailed knowledge of global energy markets, to maximize the value of the company's gas, natural gas liquids, and power interests.
Over the coming decades, natural gas is expected to play an increasingly important role in fueling the world's economic growth. ExxonMobil sells approximately 11 billion cubic feet of gas per day and is active across the gas value chain in most major markets. Our global presence, combined with our ability to leverage expertise across our Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses enables us to create innovative integrated solutions. This provides an important competitive advantage and positions ExxonMobil strongly to help meet the world's growing natural gas and power demands.
In North America, ExxonMobil is a major gas producer and processor with production from the Gulf of Mexico, the onshore Gulf Coast, the mid-continent of the United States, western Canada, and offshore eastern Canada. We are also pursuing development of gas resources in Alaska and are working with TransCanada to advance a pipeline from the Alaskan North Slope to North American markets.
In Europe, ExxonMobil is a leading gas producer through ownership in key assets in the Netherlands, Germany, and both the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. In Asia Pacific, ExxonMobil remains among the largest suppliers of gas in Australia and Malaysia, and also sells gas in Thailand and Far East Russia. In the Middle East, the recent start-up of the second phase of the Al Khaleej Gas Project resulted in a major increase in our pipeline gas sales in Qatar.
ExxonMobil has a significant global position in liquefied natural gas (LNG). We are involved in ventures in Qatar and Indonesia that supply LNG to key Asian, European, and U.S. markets.
LNG supplies from Qatar have increased significantly with the start-up of four new 7.8-million-tonnes-per-year trains  the largest in service anywhere in the world  together with the opening of new LNG regasification facilities in South Wales and offshore Italy. In the United States, the Golden Pass LNG regasification plant in Texas is scheduled to open in 2010 and we continue to progress plans for an LNG terminal offshore New Jersey. New LNG projects are also under development in Australia and Papua New Guinea.
ExxonMobil also continues to pursue unconventional gas opportunities around the world. In the United States, we started up Phase 1 production from tight gas in the Piceance Basin in Colorado during 2009. In the Horn River Basin shale gas play in British Columbia, Canada, we have commenced a second multi-well evaluation program. In Europe, we are assessing multiple shale gas and coal bed methane opportunities in Germany and Poland.
In addition to our extensive natural gas assets, we also manage about 1 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids, generate a significant amount of power, and are a leading producer of helium, particularly through our Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, and our interests in Qatar.
Power Activities
ExxonMobil has interests in about 16,000 megawatts of power generation capacity worldwide. This includes a majority interest in the Castle Peak Power Company that generates electricity for consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China. In 2009, ExxonMobil and our partners awarded contracts for front-end engineering and design for a new 500-megawatt power plant in Nigeria. We are an industry leader in the application of cogeneration technology with interests in approximately 4900 megawatts of capacity. We continue to look for opportunities around the world to make use of cogeneration to efficiently supply the power and steam demands of our facilities.

Global Leadership Across Multiple Resource Types
ExxonMobil's strategy is to identify and capture the highest-quality resources across a broad spectrum of types. We then apply our technology and project expertise to design and execute the most cost-effective development solutions to ensure maximum value and industry-leading profitability for each type of resource.
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
ExxonMobil has an extensive global position in LNG with interests in liquefaction capacity of approximately 65 million tonnes per year through our ventures in Qatar and Indonesia. This capacity has recently increased significantly with the start-up in Qatar of the four largest producing trains in the world. Each of these trains is 7.8 million tonnes per year in size. Deliveries of Q-Flex and Q-Max ships were completed in 2009 and more than doubled fleet capacity for the Qatar joint ventures. We have also added 2.8 billion cubic feet per day of LNG regasification capacity with the opening of the South Hook Terminal in Wales and the Adriatic LNG Terminal offshore Italy, increasing access to attractive European markets.
ExxonMobil's broad portfolio, our involvement across the LNG value chain, and our global marketing footprint provide important flexibility, and enable us to maximize value for our LNG ventures. We have led the industry in integrating LNG activities from production and liquefaction, to shipping, regasification and sales, and we have significant alignment with our joint venture partner Qatar Petroleum across the LNG value chain. We have also developed and applied new technologies to construct the world's largest LNG trains and ships, minimizing unit costs and maximizing the value of natural gas from Qatar's North Field  the world's largest non-associated gas field.
We are progressing new LNG projects to help meet the world's growing gas demand. In Asia Pacific, we and our joint venture partners have sanctioned the Gorgon Jansz and PNG LNG projects, which will significantly increase our volumes into Asia. Additional LNG projects are being pursued in Australia and West Africa. In 2010, another 2 billion cubic feet
per day of regasification capacity will come online with the opening of the Golden Pass Terminal near Sabine Pass, Texas.
Arctic
ExxonMobil has many decades of operating experience in arctic conditions and an extensive portfolio of opportunities ranging from new exploration plays to producing assets in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia. Our remote Sakhalin-1 project in Far East Russia started production in 2005, and features numerous technical achievements and a world-class resource of 2.3 billion barrels of oil and 17 trillion cubic feet of gas. The Chayvo field features extended-reach wells drilled from one of the world's largest land rigs to access a portion of the resource. Offshore, the ice-resistant Orlan platform develops the remainder of the field. Oil is exported from the Sakhalin-1 project year-round using strengthened tankers. Development of the Odoptu field is now under way, also using extended-reach wells drilled from shore. In North America, ExxonMobil is working to develop our significant arctic gas resources and has begun development drilling at the Point Thomson field in Alaska.
Development of the Odoptu field is under way at ExxonMobil's Sakhalin-1 project in Far East Russia. This offshore field is being developed using extended-reach wells drilled from shore. The produced oil and gas will be piped to the main processing facility at Chayvo.

Unconventional Gas
ExxonMobil has built up a large, high-quality global portfolio of tight gas, shale gas, and coal bed methane opportunities. Our tight gas leases in the Piceance Basin in Colorado, which contain an estimated 45 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, are being developed with an integrated suite of technologies and best practices. These include a new multi-component 3D seismic survey, our Fast Drill Process, and our Multi-Zone Stimulation Technology which greatly reduces the time and cost to complete wells. Recycling of produced water and other techniques are expected to reduce freshwater use by 70 to 80 percent over the next few years. By drilling larger numbers of deviated wells from each well pad, surface land use requirements are also being reduced. In 2009, we started up the Piceance Phase 1 project, which has the capacity to produce 200 million cubic feet of gas per day.
ExxonMobil has built a leading global position in shale gas plays at the lowest acquisition cost in industry. We have secured large, contiguous positions in the highest-potential basins with access to high-value markets. In the United States, we are active in the Woodford, Haynesville, and Marcellus plays, and we are the leading acreage holder in the promising Horn River play in Canada. In Europe, we have interests in over 2 million net acres of prospective shale gas acreage in Germany and Poland, and a further 2 million net acres of prospective coal bed methane acreage in Germany and Indonesia. We also have research under way that is improving our understanding of these challenging reservoirs and the most optimal methods to develop them.
In 2009, ExxonMobil and XTO Energy announced an all-stock transaction that will significantly enhance our unconventional gas portfolio and capabilities.
Deepwater
ExxonMobil has a diverse, industry-leading portfolio of deepwater opportunities around the world, covering 49 million net acres. We have interests in 24 major deepwater projects onstream in the Gulf of Mexico, and offshore West Africa and Norway, many comprising multiple individual fields. In 2009, their combined net production was approximately 460 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day. We consistently deliver deepwater projects faster than competitors, reducing costs, accelerating production, and increasing value.
We also combine our expertise in sequence stratigraphy, deepwater depositional environments, subsurface imaging, and reservoir simulation to build sophisticated field models that allow us to optimize development. After start-up, we further increase value through superior operating performance, with uptime in our operated Angola projects averaging 99.6 percent in 2009, for example.
ExxonMobil has a significant acreage position in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and drilled two wells at the Hadrian discovery in 2009. We also made a new deepwater discovery in a frontier basin offshore the Philippines and are assessing its economic potential. We have secured a very large, high-quality acreage position in the Black Sea and will begin drilling in 2010.
Conventional
Conventional resources comprise 25 percent of ExxonMobil's resource base and are located both onshore and in shallow water offshore. Although generally located in more mature hydrocarbon provinces, significant potential remains in this part of our portfolio. We apply a wide array of new technologies to these assets, including 4D seismic surveys, which can indicate areas of bypassed oil or gas in producing fields, and extended-reach drilling, which accesses additional resources from existing facilities. We recently drilled the world's longest horizontal-reach well from an offshore platform at our Santa Ynez Unit off the coast of California. We integrate our expertise in reservoir characterization and modeling with high-resolution seismic data to identify new opportunities in our producing fields, such as Beryl in the North Sea, where a new drilling program is now under way.
We routinely gather cross-functional teams of geoscientists and engineers from around the world to conduct focused studies on our conventional assets. Through a rigorous, structured approach that promotes the sharing of global best practices, these efforts have identified significant new potential in mature fields and added over half a billion barrels of oil-equivalent to ExxonMobil's resource base in 2009.

Heavy Oil/Oil Sands
ExxonMobil has an extensive portfolio of very high-quality oil sands resources. We have also developed a suite of proprietary technologies that allow us to develop these resources at the lowest unit cost in industry. For example, our High-Temperature Paraffinic Froth Treatment process produces bitumen that is essentially free of solids and can be blended with diluent for shipment by pipeline to markets. This removes the need for an upstream upgrader, greatly reducing up-front capital investment.
We have now begun construction of the Kearl Phase 1 project in Canada, which is 100-percent owned by Imperial Oil and ExxonMobil Canada. Our ability to move forward with this oil sands project is a result of ExxonMobil's strengths in securing the highest-quality resources, applying proprietary technologies, and using a disciplined, phased approach to achieve a low unit development cost. Extensive leveraging of learnings from the Syncrude project also contributes to our success at Kearl. New water management techniques will reduce the amount of off-take required from the Athabasca River during the low-flow winter season. In 2009, we also added additional high-quality oil sands resources to our portfolio.
We also have extensive expertise in the development of in situ oil sands projects. Our Cold Lake project in Canada is the world's largest thermal in situ heavy oil project. We have continuously developed and deployed new technologies over decades that have successively raised both production and the recovery factor, which is now over 30 percent. New techniques have also reduced energy requirements and dramatically cut the amount of water that is required in the process. Innovative technology allows us to recycle 95 percent of the water used at Cold Lake.
Acid/Sour Gas
In many parts of the world, natural gas deposits include carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, which need to be removed before the gas can be sold. The presence of these components often makes the gas uneconomic to develop. ExxonMobil has extensive experience in the handling and processing of acid/sour gas. At our LaBarge development in Wyoming, we produce gas that has a methane content of only approximately 20 percent, but concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide of 5 percent and 65 percent, respectively. These are separated from the hydrocarbon gas and largely injected back into the subsurface, with some of the carbon dioxide being sold to oil producers for use in enhanced oil recovery projects. An expansion project that will increase carbon dioxide sales is under way. We also employ proprietary generation technology that produces electrical power from the lowest-methane-content gas in industry. We have begun testing our proprietary technology that has the potential to significantly reduce the space requirements and cost of separating components such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.
Controlled Freeze Zone
ExxonMobil produces and processes acid/sour gas in many other countries including Germany, Norway, Kazakhstan, and Malaysia. We also have a 25-percent interest in the Gorgon Jansz LNG project offshore Australia, which will feature the world's largest carbon dioxide separation and sequestration project.

Over four decades, nearly 4 billion barrels of liquids and 7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas have been produced. Technology has been a key enabler of this success, and includes ExxonMobil's Fast Drill Process and hydrocyclone technology to handle increasing volumes of produced water as the core fields mature. New developments under way include the Kipper/Tuna (ExxonMobil interest, Kipper 32.5 percent, Tuna 50 percent) and Turrum (ExxonMobil interest, 50 percent) projects.
The 15-million-tonnes-per-year Gorgon Jansz liquefied natural gas (LNG) project (ExxonMobil interest, 25 percent) received formal sanction from
the Western Australia government and project co-venturers in 2009. This project will develop approximately 25 trillion cubic feet of gas resources located on the Northwest Shelf of Australia, and first LNG shipments are targeted for late 2014. ExxonMobil executed 20-year gas sales and purchase agreements with PetroChina International Company Limited and Petronet LNG Limited for our equity share of LNG in the project. This world-class development consists of subsea infrastructure for production and transportation of the gas, three 5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG trains, and a 280-million-cubic-feet-per-day domestic gas plant located on Barrow Island, as well as the world's largest carbon dioxide sequestration project to minimize emissions. The Jansz field will be produced via one of the world's longest subsea tiebacks, and is located in 4300 feet of water. ExxonMobil will operate Jansz development drilling, and we successfully completed and tested the Jansz-4 appraisal well during 2009.

Leveraging Global Scale and Integration
ExxonMobil is the world's largest refiner, with the most distillation, conversion, and lube basestock production capacity. We have a strong presence in mature markets around the world as well as a growing presence in the high-growth Asia Pacific region. Our refineries are more than 60 percent larger than the industry average with more conversion capacity and more integration with chemical and lubes operations. This scale and integration advantage provides us greater flexibility to optimize operations, and to produce higher-value products with lower feedstock and operating costs. We use an integrated approach when developing new business opportunities, such as our refining, petrochemicals, and fuels marketing ventures in Fujian Province, China; and when supporting Upstream ventures such as Syncrude in Alberta, Canada.
Combined with our scale and business integration, our global functional organization, established networks, and extensive research programs ensure rapid and efficient development and deployment of best practices and technology. We use Integrated Business Teams, which combine refining, supply, logistics, and marketing expertise to optimize margin capture and maximize shareholder value.
Our global scale and level of integration are structural advantages that are difficult for competitors to replicate.
Throughout the business cycle, we continue to focus on identifying margin improvements and operating efficiencies that underpin our leading financial performance.
Maintaining Capital Discipline
We continue to take a disciplined and long-term approach to the management of our capital employed while sustaining industry-leading returns. This approach includes selective and resilient investments as well as asset divestments. We continue to evaluate our portfolio during all parts of the business cycle, reflected by our divestments of selected refineries and logistics assets over the past decade. Our capital investment program includes projects to produce higher-value products and chemical feedstocks, process lower-cost raw materials, lower operating costs, meet new product quality requirements and demands, reduce environmental impact, and further upgrade safety systems.
In 2009, ExxonMobil and our partners started up new facilities that tripled the size of our joint venture refinery in Fujian Province, China, and a new joint venture condensate refinery in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar, to meet the growing demand for products in Asia Pacific and the Middle East.
To increase capacity and improve product yields at existing sites, we focus on expansions and low-cost debottleneck projects that generate attractive returns over a range of market conditions. For example, we expanded the hydrocracker capacity at our Singapore Refinery. Additionally, in 2009, we completed construction and successfully started up several projects to produce lower-sulfur diesel fuel in North and South America. We started construction at our Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Baytown, Texas; and Antwerp, Belgium, refineries on projects to increase lower-sulfur diesel fuel production by 50 percent, or approximately 6 million gallons per day, representing a total investment of over $1 billion. When completed in 2010, this increased production will be equivalent to the diesel produced from about four average-size refineries.

ExxonMobil's Capital Project System, EMCAPS, continues to provide industry-leading performance in project development and execution. Over the last nine years, our project costs were 5 to 10 percent lower than the refining industry, as confirmed by external benchmarking. We strive to improve our project execution efficiency by leveraging our global scale and utilizing a rigorous post-project appraisal process to capture lessons learned and continuously improve our project management system.
Increasing Margins
We improve margins by focusing on three key areas: economically growing production, reducing raw material costs, and increasing product realizations.
We strive to increase production by maximizing the economic utilization of our existing refining capacity. We focus on improving reliability, identifying and eliminating operating constraints, optimizing planned maintenance and intervals between planned downtimes, and expanding market outlets. These improvements are driven by the disciplined application of our proprietary Global Reliability System and Molecule Management technology. We also selectively invest in capacity expansions and debottlenecks.
Production Growth
 - 
We continue to increase operational flexibility and reduce raw material costs. For example, by expanding the application of advanced molecular fingerprinting and modeling technologies, we improve our understanding of the behavior and characteristics of raw materials processed in our refineries. This technology enables us to more precisely select and blend crudes and feedstocks with properties that will maximize yields and margins throughout our operating facilities.
Raw Materials
 - 
ExxonMobil is an industry leader in processing challenged crudes, running about twice as much
ExxonMobil Raw Material Flexibility
Challenged Crudes
as industry on a percentage basis. These crudes are difficult to handle or process because they have properties such as acid corrosivity, high nitrogen content, and other impurities. Because of these characteristics, they are discounted in the marketplace and running them in our refineries improves our financial results. Since 2004, we have increased challenged crudes processing by over 50 percent.
In addition to improving raw material selection, our Molecule Management technology ensures that the highest-value products are produced. This is especially important at our integrated sites to ensure value is maximized across our functional businesses of fuels, lubricants, and chemicals. Our processing models enable us to optimize, at a molecular level, the entire manufacturing site as well as individual process units on a real-time basis to increase yields and the blending of higher-value products.

Improving Operating Efficiency
Worldwide cash operating costs at our refineries are substantially below the industry average, as confirmed by external benchmarking. Our company's average cash operating costs have been within the first quartile of individual refineries since 2004, and we continue to widen our operating expense advantage versus industry. We achieve industry-leading cost performance by reducing energy use and leveraging our scale and integration as well as our leading-edge technologies to generate cost efficiencies.
Improved energy efficiency is a key contributor to our cost performance, and we have consistently outpaced industry in this area. ExxonMobil's proprietary Global Energy Management System (GEMS) focuses on opportunities that reduce the energy consumed at our refineries and chemical plants. Savings equal to 15 to 20 percent of the energy consumed at our manufacturing sites have been identified to date using GEMS. Through 2009, we have captured over 60 percent of these savings.
Energy Initiatives
 - 
We continue to make significant investments in cogeneration facilities that simultaneously produce electricity and useful heat or steam. With the latest technology, cogeneration is significantly more efficient than traditional methods of producing steam and power separately, and results in lower emissions. In 2009, we completed commissioning of a 125-megawatt unit in Antwerp, Belgium, and started up a 250-megawatt facility in Fujian Province, China.
In addition to energy improvement, we capture cost savings through economies of scale. For example, we use shared organizations to support operations at our integrated refining and chemical sites and continue to progress our global training initiative to improve overall workforce productivity. We are also implementing new maintenance technologies to improve productivity and reduce costs.
Cost Efficiencies
 - 
Our global procurement organization contributes to our competitive advantage. By capitalizing on our purchasing scale, market intelligence, global best practices, and a strong partnership with other ExxonMobil business units, our manufacturing sites are supplied with lower-cost materials and services.

Operating Strengths and Efficiencies
We continuously look for ways to improve our Fuels Marketing business channels. This begins with leveraging the company's operating strengths in the areas of safety, environmental performance, and business controls. Efficiency improvements continue to reduce operating expenses through the global application of processes and centralization of support activities. The combined impact of our initiatives and portfolio highgrading activities more than offsets inflation.
One important focus area is management of credit exposure. Fuels Marketing's portfolio generates significant revenue, which is managed with disciplined global credit practices. Through sound
accounts receivable management, Fuels Marketing continues to reduce overall working capital employed, improving financial returns and mitigating credit exposure.
Disciplined Capital Management
The ExxonMobil capital management strategy combines selective investments with disciplined asset highgrading to optimize the productivity of our business.
Our investment decisions are complemented by selective divestments that highgrade our asset base and improve long-term financial returns. In addition, our restructuring activities continue to enhance integration with our refining assets.
This disciplined and consistent approach has improved our capital productivity by more than 40 percent since 2005.
Integration
Downstream cross-functional teams work together to improve the value of ExxonMobil's refined products. We continue to leverage integration with Refining and Supply across our four Fuels Marketing business channels. Integrated Business Teams evaluate product placement alternatives in each market around the world, optimizing sales to higher-value channels. Common work processes, tools, and analytical methodologies enable the Integrated Business Teams to achieve these results.

Frequently Used Terms
Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil's key business and financial performance measures and other terms. These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation. In the case of financial measures that we believe constitute "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, we provide a reconciliation to the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure and other information required by that rule.
EARNINGS EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS
In addition to reporting U.S. GAAP defined net income, ExxonMobil also presents a measure of earnings that excludes earnings from special items quantified and described in our quarterly and annual earnings press releases. Earnings excluding special items is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is included to facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods. A reconciliation to net income attributable to ExxonMobil is shown on page 22. We also refer to earnings excluding special items as normalized earnings. Earnings per share amounts use the same average common shares outstanding as used for the calculation of earnings per common share and earnings per common share  assuming dilution.
OPERATING COSTS
Operating costs are the combined total of production, manufacturing, selling, general, administrative, exploration, depreciation, and depletion expenses from the Consolidated Statement of Income and ExxonMobil's share of similar costs for equity companies. Operating costs are the costs during the period to produce, manufacture, and otherwise prepare the company's products for sale  including energy costs, staffing, maintenance, and other costs to explore for and produce oil and gas, and operate refining and chemical plants. Distribution and marketing expenses are also included. Operating costs exclude the cost of raw materials, taxes, and interest expense. These expenses are on a before-tax basis. While ExxonMobil's management is responsible for all revenue and expense elements of net income, operating costs, as defined below, represent the expenses most directly under management's control. Information regarding these costs is therefore useful for investors and ExxonMobil management in evaluating management's performance.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
Shareholder return measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. We calculate shareholder return over a particular measurement period by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period. For this purpose, we assume dividends are reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the same time actual dividends are paid. Shareholder return is usually quoted on an annualized basis.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES (Capex)
Capital and exploration expenditures are the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the Summary Statement of Income. ExxonMobil's Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil's management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.
CAPITAL EMPLOYED
Capital employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil's net share of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes ExxonMobil's share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil's share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.
RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE)
Return on average capital employed is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning- and end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil's share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation's total ROCE is net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry, both to evaluate management's performance and to demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long term. Additional measures, which are more cash-flow based, are used to make investment decisions.

ENTITLEMENT VOLUME EFFECTS
Production Sharing Contract (PSC) net interest reductions are contractual reductions in ExxonMobil's share of production volumes covered by PSCs. These reductions typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve thresholds as specified in the PSCs. Once a net interest reduction has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
Production Sharing Contract Net Interest Reductions
 - 
Price and spend impacts on volumes are fluctuations in ExxonMobil's share of production volumes caused by changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. For example, at higher prices fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for crude oil or natural gas.
Price and Spend Impacts on Volumes
 - 
FINDING AND RESOURCE-ACQUISITION COSTS
Finding and resource-acquisition costs per oil-equivalent barrel is a performance measure that is calculated using the Exploration portion of Upstream capital and exploration expenditures and proved property acquisition costs divided by resource additions (in oil-equivalent barrels). ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries and acquisitions of discovered resources as resource additions. In addition to proved reserves, resource additions include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but which ExxonMobil believes will likely be moved into the proved reserves category and produced in the future.
PROVED RESERVES
Proved reserves of oil and gas in this report are determined on the basis that ExxonMobil uses to manage its business. On this basis, "proved reserves" means quantities of oil and gas that ExxonMobil has determined to be reasonably certain of recovery under existing economic and operating conditions under our long-standing, rigorous management review process. We only book proved reserves when we have made significant funding commitments for the related projects. ExxonMobil's reserves are different from proved reserves as defined by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement.
A principal difference between the ExxonMobil and SEC definitions is the price assumption used. Proved reserves in this report are based on the same price and cost assumptions we use to make investment decisions. Proved reserves as defined by the SEC are based on historical market prices: beginning in 2009, the average of the market prices on the first day of each calendar month during the year; for prior years, the market price on December 31. References to "price/cost effects" mean the effect of using SEC historical prices and costs.
For years prior to 2009, another key difference was the treatment of oil sands reserves extracted in mining operations, as well as reserves attributable to equity companies. In this report, oil sands reserves and our share of equity company reserves are included in ExxonMobil's proved reserves for all periods. Under SEC definitions applicable to the prior years, these volumes were separately reported.
The table below shows year-end proved reserves on these different bases:
RESOURCES, RESOURCE BASE, AND RECOVERABLE RESOURCES
Resources, resource base, recoverable resources, recoverable oil, recoverable hydrocarbons, and similar terms used in this report are the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The resource base includes quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but which ExxonMobil believes will likely be moved into the proved reserves category and produced in the future. The term "resource base" is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as "probable" or "possible" reserves.
PROVED RESERVES REPLACEMENT RATIO
Proved reserves replacement ratio is a performance measure that is calculated using proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided by oil-equivalent production. Both proved reserves additions and production include amounts applicable to equity companies. Unless otherwise specified, ExxonMobil reports this ratio on the basis of the company's definition of proved reserves. See "Proved Reserves" above.
Table of Contents
   
EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION 2009 FINANCIAL & OPERATING REVIEW
 - 
103
PROVED RESERVES REPLACEMENT COSTS
Proved reserves replacement costs per oil-equivalent barrel is a performance measure ratio. Proved reserves replacement costs per barrel are costs incurred in property acquisition and exploration, plus costs incurred in development activities, divided by proved oil-equivalent reserves additions, excluding sales. Unless otherwise specified, ExxonMobil reports these costs on the basis of ExxonMobil's definition of proved reserves. See "Proved Reserves" on previous page.
HEAVY OIL AND OIL SANDS
Heavy oil, for the purpose of this report, includes heavy oil, extra heavy oil, and bitumen, as defined by the World Petroleum Congress in 1987 based on American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity and viscosity at reservoir conditions. Heavy oil has an API gravity between 10 and 22.3 degrees. The API gravity of extra heavy oil and bitumen is less than 10 degrees. Extra heavy oil has a viscosity less than 10 thousand centipoise, whereas the viscosity of bitumen is greater than 10 thousand centipoise. The term "oil sands" is used to indicate heavy oil (generally bitumen) that is recovered in a mining operation.
CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES
Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant and equipment from the Summary Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow is the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation's assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation's strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
The Corporation distributes cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share purchases. Shares are purchased both to reduce shares outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs. For purposes of calculating distributions to shareholders, the Corporation only includes the cost of those shares purchased to reduce shares outstanding.
