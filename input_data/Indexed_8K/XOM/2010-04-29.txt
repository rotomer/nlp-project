1Q10 Investor Relations Data Summary.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
:
EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED
"ExxonMobil achieved solid results from its worldwide operations with first quarter earnings of $6.3 billion, up 38% from first quarter of last year.  Our results reflect higher crude oil realizations and stronger chemical margins while the downstream industry margins remained weak.
Oil-equivalent production increased by 4.5% over the first quarter of 2009 driven by contributions from recent start-ups of our world-class assets in Qatar.
Our solid financial position enabled ongoing investment at record levels through the business cycle.  In the first quarter, capital and exploration spending was $6.9 billion, up 19% from last year.
Nearly $4 billion was returned to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.  
We are continuing to progress the XTO merger and received clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Dutch authorities.  We continue to target for completion by the end of the second quarter."        
FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
Earnings were $6,300 million, an increase of 38% or $1,750 million from the first quarter of 2009.
Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.33, an increase of 45%.
Earnings include a charge of approximately $200 million (-$0.04 EPS) associated with the recently enacted U.S. health care legislation.
Capital and exploration expenditures were $6.9 billion, up 19% from the first quarter of 2009.
Oil-equivalent production increased 4.5% from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up nearly 6%.
Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $13.5 billion, including asset sales of $0.4 billion.
Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were about $2 billion.
Ras Laffan 3 LNG Train 7 commenced operations in the first quarter and represents the fourth 7.8 million tons per year LNG plant brought online by Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil joint ventures within the past 12 months.
ExxonMobil Iraq Limited signed an agreement with the Iraq Ministry of Oil to redevelop and expand the West Qurna-1 field in southern Iraq.   
First Quarter 2010 vs. First Quarter 2009
Upstream earnings were $5,814 million, up $2,311 million from the first quarter of 2009. Higher crude oil prices, partly offset by lower natural gas realizations, increased earnings $2.5 billion.  Higher gas volumes improved earnings by $190 million while higher operating expenses decreased earnings $380 million.
On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 4.5% from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up nearly 6%.
Liquids production totaled 2,414 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 62 kbd from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was down 1%, as increased production from projects in Qatar and Kazakhstan was offset by field decline.
First quarter natural gas production was 11,689 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), up1,502 mcfd from 2009, driven by project ramp-ups in Qatar and higher demand in Europe.
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,091 million, $731 million higher than the first quarter of 2009. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $4,723 million, up $1,580 million.
Downstream earnings were $37 million, down $1,096 million. Lower refining margins drove the majority of the decline, reducing earnings $1.1 billion. Petroleum product sales of 6,144 kbd were 290 kbd lower than last year's first quarter, mainly reflecting lower demand.
The U.S. Downstream recorded a loss of $60 million, down $412 million from the first quarter of 2009. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $97 million were $684 million lower.
Chemical earnings of $1,249 million were $899 million higher than the first quarter of 2009.  Stronger margins improved earnings by nearly $480 million while higher sales volumes increased earnings $180 million. All other items, including asset management
gains and the absence of hurricane costs from 2009, increased earnings by $240 million. First quarter prime product sales of 6,488 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 961 kt higher than the prior year primarily due to improved global demand.
Corporate and financing expenses were $800 million, up $364 million from first quarter 2009, mainly due to a charge related to the U.S. health care legislation signed into law in March 2010 and the absence of favorable 2009 tax items.
During the first quarter of 2010, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 37 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $2.5 billion. These purchases included about $2 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans and programs.  Shares outstanding were reduced from 4,727 million at the end of the fourth quarter to 4,698 million at the end of the first quarter. Second quarter 2010 share purchases are expected to continue at a pace of about $2 billion. However, total purchases for the quarter may be less due to trading restrictions during the proxy solicitation period for the XTO merger. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
Estimates of key financial and operating data follow.  
 
ExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters on a webcast at 10 a.m. Central time on April 29, 2010.  To listen to the event live or in archive, go to our website at .

Cautionary statement
Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking statements.  Actual results, including benefits resulting from the XTO transaction; project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including: the timing and conditions of regulatory clearance for the XTO merger; our ability to integrate the businesses of XTO and ExxonMobil effectively after closing; changes in long-term oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas industry; unforeseen technical difficulties; political events or disturbances; reservoir performance; the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Resu lts" in the "investors" section of our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2009 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date. References to quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as "proved reserves" under SEC definitions.
Frequently used terms
Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.  Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods.  Reconciliation to net income attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.  The release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales.  Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II.  Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other t erms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available through the "investors" section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
Reference to Earnings
References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.  Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, special items, earnings excluding special items, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
