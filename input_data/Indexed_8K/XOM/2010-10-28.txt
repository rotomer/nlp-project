3Q10 Investor Relations Data Summary.

   
EXHIBIT 99.1
 
:
EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED
"Despite continuing economic uncertainty, we had strong quarterly results and continued to advance our robust investment opportunities.  Third quarter earnings were $7.4 billion, up 55% from third quarter of last year due to higher crude oil and natural gas realizations, improved refining margins, and solid chemical results.  Earnings for the first nine months of 2010, excluding special items, were $21.2 billion, up 59% over the first nine months of 2009.  
Oil-equivalent production was over 20% higher than the third quarter of 2009, driven by our world-class assets in Qatar and our recent unconventional gas acquisition.
Capital and exploration spending for the first nine months of 2010 was $22.2 billion, up 18% from the first nine months of last year.
The Corporation returned over $5 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding."
Third Quarter 2010 vs. Third Quarter 2009
Upstream earnings were $5,467 million, up $1,455 million from the third quarter of 2009.  Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $1 billion, while higher liquids and gas volumes improved earnings by $270 million.  
On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased over 20% from the third quarter of 2009. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up 20%.
Liquids production totaled 2,421 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), up 86 kbd or nearly 4% from the third quarter of 2009.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was up 3%, as increased production from projects in Qatar and the addition of XTO volumes more than offset net field decline.
Third quarter natural gas production was 12,192 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), up 4,037 mcfd from 2009,driven by additional U.S. unconventional gas volumes and project ramp-ups in Qatar.
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $999 million, $290 million higher than the third quarter of 2009. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $4,468 million, up $1,165 million from last year.
Downstream earnings of $1,160 million were up $835 million from the third quarter of 2009.  Higher industry refining margins, partly offset by lower marketing margins increased earnings by $300 million.  Volume and product mix effects increased earnings by $150 million while other factors, mainly asset sales and favorable foreign exchange impacts, increased earnings by $390 million. Petroleum product sales of 6,574 kbd were 273 kbd higher than last year's third quarter, mainly reflecting higher demand.
Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $164 million, up $367 million from the third quarter of 2009. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $996 million were $468 million higher than last year.
Chemical earnings of $1,229 million were $353 million higher than the third quarter of 2009.  Improved margins increased earnings by $370 million. Third quarter prime product sales of 6,558 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 202 kt higher than the prior year primarily due to improved global demand and start-up of the Fujian facility in China.
Corporate and financing expenses were $506 million, up $23 million from the third quarter of 2009.
During the third quarter of 2010, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 54 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $3.3 billion. These purchases included $3 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans and programs. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal $5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
First Nine Months 2010 vs. First Nine Months 2009
Earnings of $21,210 million ($4.37 per share) increased $7,980 million from 2009.  Excluding special items, earnings for the first nine months of 2010 increased $7,840 million from 2009.
Upstream earnings were $16,617 million, up $5,290 million from 2009. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings approximately $5.1 billion.  The favorable impact of higher volumes of $590 million was partially offset by higher operating costs of $340 million.
On an oil-equivalent basis, production was up 11% compared to the first nine months of 2009. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up 12%.
Liquids production of 2,387 kbd increased 2 kbd compared with 2009.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production increased 1% compared with 2009, as new volumes from project ramp-ups in Qatar were offset by net field decline.
Natural gas production of 11,304 mcfd increased 2,518 mcfd from 2009, driven by higher volumes from Qatar projects and additional U.S. unconventional gas volumes.
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2010 were $2,955 million, an increase of $1,073 million from 2009.  Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $13,662 million, up $4,217 million from 2009.
Downstream earnings of $2,417 million were $447 million higher than 2009.  Positive sales volume mix effects increased earnings by $430 million.  Negative foreign exchange impacts of $320 million were offset by favorable tax items.  Petroleum product sales of 6,359 kbd decreased 48 kbd.
U.S. Downstream earnings were $544 million, up $410 million from 2009. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,873 million, $37 million higher than last year.
Chemical earnings of $3,846 million increased $2,253 million from 2009. Improved margins increased earnings by approximately $1.7 billion while higher volumes increased earnings about $370 million. Prime product sales of 19,542 kt were up 1,392 kt from 2009.
Corporate and financing expenses excluding special items were $1,670 million, up $150 million from 2009 mainly due to a tax charge related to the U.S. health care legislation during the first quarter of 2010.
Gross share purchases through the first nine months of 2010 were $7.3 billion, reducing shares outstanding by 115 million shares.

Cautionary statement
Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking statements.  Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in long-term oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas industry; unforeseen technical difficulties; political events or disturbances; reservoir performance; the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the "investors" section of our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2009 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date. References to quantities o f oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as "proved reserves" under SEC definitions.
Frequently used terms
Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.  Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods.  Reconciliation to net income attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.  The release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales.  Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II.  Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available through the "investors" section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
Reference to Earnings
References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.  Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, special items, earnings excluding special items, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
