4Q10 Investor Relations Data Summary.

EXHIBIT 99.1
:
EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED
"ExxonMobil continues to deliver strong financial and operating results.  The full year 2010 earnings, excluding special items, were $30.5 billion, up 57% from 2009, driven by higher crude oil and natural gas realizations, stronger refining margins and record Chemical performance.  Fourth quarter earnings were $9.3 billion, an increase of 53%.
Oil-equivalent production was 19% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by our world-class assets in Qatar and our growing unconventional gas production.
Capital and exploration expenditures were $32.2 billion in 2010, reflecting a record level of investment.
The Corporation returned over $19 billion to shareholders in 2010 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding."
Fourth Quarter 2010 vs. Fourth Quarter 2009
Upstream earnings were $7,480 million, up $1,700 million from the fourth quarter of 2009.  Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by nearly $1.4 billion.  Higher liquids and gas volumes improved earnings by $560 million while higher operating expenses reduced earnings by $200 million.  
On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 19% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up 18%.
Liquids production totaled 2,526 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), up 133 kbd or nearly 6% from the fourth quarter of 2009.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was up 6%, as increased production from projects in Qatar and the addition of XTO volumes more than offset net field decline.
Fourth quarter natural gas production was 14,652 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), up 3,935 mcfd from 2009,driven by additional U.S. unconventional gas volumes and project ramp-ups in Qatar.
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,317 million, $306 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $6,163 million, up $1,394 million from last year.
Downstream earnings of $1,150 million were up $1,339 million from the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by higher industry refining margins which increased earnings by $1.3 billion.  Petroleum product sales of 6,555 kbd were 66 kbd higher than last year's fourth quarter, mainly reflecting higher demand.
Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $226 million, up $513 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $924 million were $826 million higher than last year.
Chemical earnings of $1,067 million were $351 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. Improved margins increased earnings by $380 million. Fourth quarter prime product sales of 6,349 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 326 kt lower than the prior year.
Corporate and financing expenses were $447 million, up $190 million from the fourth quarter of 2009 due to financing activities.
During the fourth quarter of 2010, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 83 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $5.8 billion. These purchases included $5 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans and programs. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal $5 billion in the first quarter of 2011.  Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
Full Year 2010 vs. Full Year 2009
Earnings of $30,460 million ($6.22 per share) increased $11,180 million from 2009.  Excluding special items, earnings for 2010 increased $11,040 million from 2009.
Upstream earnings were $24,097 million, up $6,990 million from 2009. Higher realizations increased earnings approximately $6.5 billion.  Higher volumes increased earnings by $1.2 billion, while all other items, including higher operating costs, decreased earnings by $690 million.
On an oil-equivalent basis, production was up 13% compared to 2009. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up 14%.
Liquids production of 2,422 kbd increased 35 kbd compared with 2009.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production increased 2% from 2009, as project ramp-ups in Qatar and the addition of XTO were offset by net field decline.
Natural gas production of 12,148 mcfd increased 2,875 mcfd from 2009, driven by higher volumes from Qatar projects and additional U.S. unconventional gas volumes.
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2010 were $4,272 million, an increase of $1,379 million from 2009.  Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $19,825 million, up $5,611 million from 2009.
Downstream earnings of $3,567 million were $1,786 million higher than 2009.  Higher industry refining margins increased earnings by $1.2 billion.  Positive volume and mix effects increased earnings by $420 million, while all other items, including lower operating expenses, increased earnings by $210 million.  Petroleum product sales of 6,414 kbd decreased 14 kbd.
U.S. Downstream earnings were $770 million, up $923 million from 2009. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $2,797 million, $863 million higher than last year.
Chemical earnings were a record $4,913 million, up $2,604 million from 2009. Improved margins increased earnings by $2 billion while higher volumes increased earnings about $380 million. Prime product sales of 25,891 kt were up 1,066 kt from 2009.
Corporate and financing expenses excluding special items were $2,117 million, up $340 million from 2009 mainly due to a tax charge related to the U.S. health care legislation during the first quarter of 2010 and financing activities.
Gross share purchases for 2010 were $13 billion, reducing shares outstanding by 199 million shares.

Cautionary statement
Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking statements.  Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in long-term oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas industry; unforeseen technical difficulties; political events or disturbances; reservoir performance; the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the "investors" section of our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2009 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date. References to quantities o f oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as "proved reserves" under SEC definitions.
Frequently used terms
Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.  Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods.  Reconciliation to net income attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.  The release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales.  Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II.  Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available through the "investors" section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
Reference to Earnings
References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.  Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, special items, earnings excluding special items, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
