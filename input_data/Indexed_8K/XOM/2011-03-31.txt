Meeting growing energy demand in a safe and environmentally responsible way is a key challenge of our time.
The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030
Ensuring reliable and affordable energy supplies to support human progress, safely and with minimum impact to the environment, is a key challenge facing not only ExxonMobil, but also governments and societies around the world. ExxonMobil's
, outlines our long-term forecast of supply and demand trends, which guides our investment decisions. We also share it publicly to encourage a better understanding of global energy systems and challenges.
GROWING ENERGY CHALLENGES
Despite an uneven pace of economic recovery, global energy demand is likely to grow by about 35 percent from 2005 to 2030, even with significant gains in efficiency. Virtually all the growth in energy use will occur in developing countries, where demand will increase more than 70 percent, led by China and India.
Key Conclusions
Meeting needs for reliable, affordable energy continues to require the wise and efficient use of energy. We anticipate efficiency gains will curb global energy demand by one-third in 2030 and contribute to significant progress in stemming the growth of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO) emissions, a component of greenhouse gas.
2
Keeping pace with global energy demand  including replacing supplies consumed each day and adding capacity to meet higher demand going forward  will require huge investments and pursuit of a diverse mix of economic sources of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, the investment required in new energy supply infrastructure is likely to be more than $1 trillion per year on average through 2035. At the same time, we must continue to advance technologies to handle increasing complexities of energy production and minimize the impact on the environment.
Global Energy Demand and Supply Increasing
Through 2030, the global energy demand picture will be shaped by economic expansion and progress, particularly in non-OECD countries, which will account for essentially all the growth in energy use. More than half of the growth in demand will be driven by increasing energy needs for power generation, making it the largest and fastest growing demand sector.

Growing Global Energy Demand and CO Emissions
2
Energy-related carbon dioxide (CO) emissions are linked to the types and amounts of energy used globally. These emissions are likely to rise about 25 percent from 2005 to 2030. While substantial, this rate of increase is significantly lower than that projected for energy demand and reflects trends that are significantly different for OECD and non-OECD countries. Energy-related CO emissions in non-OECD nations exceed those in the OECD by almost 40 percent today, and by 2030 are likely to be double those of the OECD countries. At the same time, emissions on a per capita basis will remain substantially higher in OECD countries, even though actual OECD emissions will decline significantly by 2030.

PROVIDING SOLUTIONS
Meeting Increasing Worldwide Needs for Liquid Fuels
Oil is the world's single largest energy source with its most prominent use being for transportation. Nearly all the world's transportation runs on liquid fuels because they provide a large quantity of energy in small volumes, making them easy to transport and widely available. Liquid fuels will also remain important for meeting industrial and residential needs. By 2030, the total demand for liquids will exceed 100 million oil-equivalent barrels per day.
Meeting the global liquids demand in an economic and environmentally responsible manner is critically important. The world's large resource base, coupled with continuing advances in technology, will facilitate meeting this demand. Still, it will require

operational excellence, deployment of advanced technologies, access to resources, and sound, reliable policies that foster timely investments and open trade.
Many of the world's promising resources require advanced technologies to unlock potential supplies. Resources such as those existing in deepwater and oil sands will be increasingly important through 2030.
Given its abundance and its properties as an efficient, clean-burning fuel, natural gas will meet a growing share of the world's energy needs. In North America and Europe, natural gas contributes more than 20 percent of total energy, and its share will increase as gas demand grows by 25 to 30 percent. In Asia Pacific, natural gas is about 10 percent of total energy demand and will grow much more rapidly, nearly tripling by 2030 versus 2005.
Natural Gas to Meet a Rising Share of Energy Needs
An important supply development has been the expansion of unconventional natural gas, which is the result of recent improvements in technologies used to tap these hard-to-produce resources. This is particularly the case in the United States, where unconventional sources are expected to satisfy more than 50 percent of gas demand in 2030. We also anticipate growing supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet growing demand, particularly in Europe and in Asia Pacific.
Helping expand access to modern energy and technology will remain critical to help people prosper in the decades ahead, with technology and the mix of economic energy supplies continuing to evolve. To provide solutions of the scale embodied by the , the world will need

tremendous levels of investment, sustained over decades; an unwavering drive for innovation and new technology; and, policies that promote a level playing field for pursuing all commercially viable energy solutions. ExxonMobil is making enormous investments to provide effective energy solutions to help enable progress around the world.
UpClose:
The Importance of Natural Gas
Growing demand for natural gas reflects its ability to serve as a reliable, affordable energy source for increasing power generation, and industrial and residential/commercial needs, while also mitigating impacts on the environment. ExxonMobil's contains several projections that underscore the importance of natural gas.
Outlook for Energy
A key driver for growth in natural gas is global demand for electricity, which is likely to rise by more than 80 percent from 2005 to 2030. This reflects economic progress and the fact that close to 1.4 billion people currently lack access to electricity. To help meet this tremendous need for power generation, natural gas is a particularly attractive fuel. It is abundant, and gas-fired power plants are based on proven technology, can be built quickly and economically, and will produce up to 60-percent fewer CO emissions than coal-fired plants.
2
On the supply side, ExxonMobil views unconventional gas as a key resource for meeting the world's energy and environmental needs. By 2030, global production of tight gas, shale gas, and other forms of unconventional gas is expected to be close to five times the level of 2005. Unconventional supplies will represent more than 15 percent of global natural gas production in 2030, compared to about 5 percent in 2005.
In addition, there is a large and growing market for liquefied natural gas (LNG), enabled by technologies that have expanded economic supply options. Expansion of LNG supplies will support a growing need for natural gas imports to meet rising demand in many markets, including the United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

Meeting the energy challenge requires effective risk management and a relentless focus on operational excellence.
Risk is a part of any business. The energy industry faces a unique set of risks. There are technical, financial, and geopolitical risks as well as risks to safety, security, health, and the environment. The extent to which an organization identifies and successfully manages risks will define its business success.
ExxonMobil believes that our ability to consistently deliver strong returns to shareholders is a direct result of our ability to effectively manage risk.
Risk cannot be eliminated, but it can be managed. ExxonMobil manages risk through a capable and committed workforce with clear accountability, well-developed and clearly defined policies and procedures, high standards of design, rigorously applied management systems, employee and contractor training, and a systematic approach to assessing performance that drives continuous improvement.
MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK
As events in 2010 made clear, the energy industry faces multiple risks and challenges. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico highlighted the technical risk involved in energy exploration and production. The incident shook public confidence in our industry and spurred governments and consumers to ask what the industry can do to ensure that meeting future energy needs does not come at the expense of safety or the environment.
Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS)
By focusing on the integrity of our operations, ExxonMobil improves safety and environmental performance, and maximizes the return to shareholders.
ExxonMobil asked itself a similar question after the 1989 Valdez oil spill. We realized that just a commitment to safety and operational excellence was not enough. What was also needed was a system that put commitment into action: a global framework that put safety first and treated safety, security, health and environmental performance with the same discipline, structure, and accountability that we applied to our operations.
ExxonMobil today employs such a framework: our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS). OIMS is the cornerstone of our commitment to managing risks to safety, security, health, and the environment. It guides the activities of each of our employees and contractors around the world.
OIMS is a rigorous, 11-element system designed to identify hazards and manage risks. It covers: design,
(1) Excludes XTO Energy Inc. data. (2) Employee safety data from participating American Petroleum Institute companies (2010 industry data not available at time of publication).
 
construction and maintenance of facilities; preparation of employees and communities for natural disaster or other incidents; and thorough investigations into accidents and safety incidents.
Through OIMS, ExxonMobil has achieved industry-leading safety performance. Our lost-time incident rates have been significantly reduced, and operating efficiencies have improved. Risks to the environment have been reduced, with a sharp decline in spills and continuing reduction in emissions. By focusing on the integrity of our operations, ExxonMobil improves safety and environmental performance, and maximizes the return to shareholders.
OIMS guides the activities of each of our more than 80,000 employees, as well as our contractors around the world. It is embedded into everyday work processes at all levels. Through OIMS, we achieved best-ever lost-time incident rates in 2010.

ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE RISK
The risk of climate change is important to the environment, the world economies, and to ExxonMobil's business. Addressing this risk, while still providing reliable, affordable energy to meet growing demand, is the global challenge that shapes ExxonMobil's activities and investments.
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Since 2005, we have invested $1.6 billion in activities that improve our energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
ExxonMobil has substantially reduced emissions from our manufacturing operations. We remain on track to achieve our goal of improving energy efficiency across our worldwide manufacturing operations by at least 10 percent between 2002 and 2012 by applying our Global Energy Management System.
ExxonMobil has also made significant reductions in flaring and increases in cogeneration. We have invested more than $5 billion in gas utilization and commercialization projects to reduce natural gas flaring. Our hydrocarbon flaring is down almost 60 percent from levels of only a few years ago. With cogeneration, ExxonMobil can produce electricity for our operations with less GHG emissions than conventional power generation. ExxonMobil has interests in about 4.9 gigawatts of cogeneration capacity in over 100 individual installations at more than 30 locations around the world. We plan to increase our cogeneration capacity to more than 5 gigawatts in the next few years.
As a result of these investments, ExxonMobil has reduced costs, improved operational reliability, and reduced our GHG emissions by more than 11 million tonnes in 2010 compared to 2005.
ExxonMobil has also been active in developing and applying carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to safely and effectively capture, transport, and store carbon dioxide (CO), a component of greenhouse gas, in underground geologic formations. In 2010, we captured approximately 5 million tonnes of CO for underground injection in our natural gas operations in Wyoming in the United States and in our equity interest in the Sleipner field in Norway. CCS is a promising technology, and ExxonMobil has ongoing research to find breakthroughs to reduce the high costs of capturing CO.

In addition, because natural gas has lower CO emissions per unit of energy, our substantial natural gas portfolio has the potential to help reduce GHG emissions while meeting the world's growing energy needs. Also, our significant research program on algae biofuels could provide GHG reductions since algae consume CO. We are also developing technologies that help consumers use energy more efficiently.

Upstream
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
In 2010, in addition to delivering strong operating results, ExxonMobil Upstream continued to make significant investments to develop our diverse project portfolio and position us to deliver the energy required for the future.
With our partner Qatar Petroleum, we completed the Qatar liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain with the start-up of RasGas Train 7 and initial commissioning and first gas send-out at the Golden Pass LNG receiving terminal. These projects are the latest in a series of world-scale integrated projects that ensure gas from the North Field of Qatar can be competitively delivered to markets around the world.
In the first quarter of 2010, ExxonMobil signed an agreement for the redevelopment and expansion of the West Qurna (Phase I) field in Iraq. Working with our partners, we commenced drilling, wellwork, and facility modification activities to begin ramp-up of production.
In June 2010, ExxonMobil became the largest natural gas producer in the United States following the merger with XTO Energy Inc. Combining these assets with our existing acreage position created a premier global unconventional gas portfolio. Through the remainder of the year, we progressed integration activities by transferring best practices across our operations and applying XTO's expertise across our global unconventional portfolio.
In addition to these achievements, ExxonMobil has continued to capture new opportunities to add to our resource base, including the acquiring of unconventional assets in multiple North American shale gas locations. We also continued our active exploration around the globe. Our balanced exploration program is designed to test new high-potential exploration areas, further explore emerging unconventional opportunities, and continue to add resources through ongoing activity in established areas.
Overall, our Upstream business continues to effectively manage the safety, environmental, technical, financial, and geopolitical risks of our business, while delivering significant long-term value for our shareholders.

Resources and Proved Reserves
   In 2010, ExxonMobil added 14.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels to our resource base. After accounting for production, asset sales, and revisions to existing fields, the resource base increased by 9.7 billion oil-equivalent barrels in 2010, bringing our resource base total to 84 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Proved reserves comprise 29 percent of our resource base.
Resources
ExxonMobil's resource base is a major source of competitive advantage and is the largest resource base among the international oil companies. The size and diversity also support risk management and investment flexibility. The success of ExxonMobil's global strategy for opportunity identification, evaluation, pursuit, and capture is demonstrated by the addition of an average of 5.2 billion oil-equivalent barrels of resource per year over the past five years.
We continue to grow our resource base through by-the-bit drilling success, discovered undeveloped resource capture, strategic acquisitions, and increased recovery from our existing fields. At year-end 2010, the XTO fields accounted for approximately 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels of the resource base, spanning the spectrum of shale gas, tight gas, shale oil, coal bed methane, and conventional reservoirs. Additional resources were added in Iraq, Athabasca and Horn River in Canada, onshore United States, and also deepwater exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Our exploration by-the-bit drilling program added 2.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels from additions spanning the globe and multiple resource types. Our exploration drilling by-the-bit resource base additions have averaged approximately 2.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels per year across the past decade.

The resource base is updated annually for new discoveries and to reflect changes in estimates of existing resources. Changes to existing resources may result from new drilling or from revisions to forecast recovery estimates achieved through the use of new technology. Updates may also occur due to fiscal regime changes, revisions in equity for existing assets, modifications to depletion plans, and from ongoing geoscience and engineering evaluations. Volumes produced or sold during the year are removed from the resource base at year end.
The largest single component of ExxonMobil's resource base remains conventional oil and gas, which comprise 24 percent. Heavy oil, predominantly in Canada, accounts for just over 21 percent of the resource base. Over the last decade, our growing positions in both liquefied natural gas, and unconventional gas and oil have increased their combined share of the resource base to about 30 percent. The remainder is made up of arctic, deepwater, and acid/sour gas.
Effective use of ExxonMobil's proprietary processes and best practices has resulted in continued low exploration resource addition cost. In 2010, our exploration resource addition cost was $0.87 per oil-equivalent barrel, and the five-year average cost was $1.00 per oil-equivalent barrel. The 2010 resource additions provide an attractive range of development opportunities for the future.
At year-end 2010, our resource base included 24.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved oil and gas reserves, equating to 15 years of reserves life at current production rates. With these resources and reserves, ExxonMobil maintains a diverse, global portfolio.
Proved Reserves
In 2010, ExxonMobil replaced 209 percent of reserves produced, including the effect of asset sales, by adding 3.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels to proved reserves while producing 1.7 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Excluding asset sales, our proved reserves replacement was 211 percent. These reserves represent a diverse global portfolio distributed evenly across geographic regions and resource types. Key reserves additions came from North American unconventional resources and from our operations in Russia, Nigeria, Norway, and Abu Dhabi. Our 2010 acquisition of XTO added significant proved reserves, primarily from unconventional onshore operations in the Barnett Shale, Freestone Trend, Arkoma Basin, and East Texas.
ExxonMobil's reserves represent a diverse global portfolio distributed across many geographic regions and resource types.
ExxonMobil has added 10.2 billion oil-equivalent barrels to proved reserves over the last five years, more than replacing production. In that time frame, the development of new fields and extensions of existing fields have added an average of 0.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels per year to proved reserves. Revisions have averaged about 0.7 billion oil-equivalent barrels per year over the last five years, driven by effective reservoir management and the application of new technology. ExxonMobil has more than replaced reserves for 17 consecutive years.
The annual reporting of proved reserves is a product of ExxonMobil's rigorous and structured management review process that is stewarded by a team of experienced reserves experts with global responsibilities. ExxonMobil calculates reserves consistent with SEC guidelines.

Capitalize on Growing Natural Gas and Power Markets
ExxonMobil employs a worldwide team of commercial experts, with detailed knowledge of global energy markets, to maximize the value of the company's gas, natural gas liquids, and power interests.
Reliable economic supplies of natural gas and power are fundamental to fuel the world's economic development. Over the coming decades, natural gas is expected to play an increasingly important role in meeting the world's energy needs. ExxonMobil sold 14.7 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2010, and was active across the gas value chain in most major markets. Our global presence, combined with an ability to leverage expertise across our Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses, enables us to deliver innovative integrated solutions. This provides a sustainable competitive advantage and positions ExxonMobil to help meet the world's growing natural gas and power demands.
In North America, ExxonMobil is a major gas producer and processor with production from the Gulf of Mexico, onshore Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and Northeast United States, western Canada, and offshore eastern Canada. Following the XTO merger, we are now the leading producer of natural gas and have the largest proved gas reserves in the United States. We continue to pursue development of natural gas resources in Alaska and are working with TransCanada and others to advance a pipeline from the Alaskan North Slope to North American markets.
In Europe, ExxonMobil is a leading natural gas producer through ownership in key assets in the Netherlands, Germany, and both the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. In Asia Pacific, ExxonMobil remains among the largest suppliers of natural gas in Australia and Malaysia, and also sells gas in Thailand and far east Russia. In the Middle East, the recent start-up of Phase 2 of the Al Khaleej Gas project resulted in a major increase in pipeline gas sales in Qatar and associated natural gas liquids sales.
ExxonMobil has a significant global position in liquefied natural gas (LNG). We are involved in successful ventures in Qatar and Indonesia, which provide substantial volumes of LNG to key European and Asian markets, and the Americas. ExxonMobil's LNG supplies from Qatar, which has the largest trains in service anywhere in the world, increased significantly with the recent completion of four new 7.8-million-tonne-per-year trains. ExxonMobil has ownership interest in LNG regasification facilities in the United Kingdom and offshore Italy, as well as the Golden Pass terminal in Texas that began commissioning and achieved first gas send-out in 2010. These terminals and our suite of sales arrangements position us well to access multiple markets and maximize LNG value. New LNG projects in which ExxonMobil has an interest are also under construction in Papua New Guinea and Western Australia.
ExxonMobil also continues to pursue unconventional gas opportunities around the world. In North America, the merger with XTO Energy Inc. significantly expanded our presence in some of the most prolific unconventional basins. In Europe, we continue to assess multiple shale gas and coal bed methane (CBM) opportunities, including those in Germany and Poland. In Indonesia, we are evaluating CBM opportunities and potential options for gas commercialization.
In addition to our extensive natural gas interests, we also manage about 1 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids, generate a significant amount of power, and are a leading producer of helium, through our Shute Creek facility in Wyoming and our interests in Qatar.
ExxonMobil has interests in about 16 gigawatts of power generation capacity worldwide. This includes a majority interest in the Castle Peak Power Company that generates electricity for consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China. In Nigeria, ExxonMobil and our partners continue with front-end engineering and design of a new 500-megawatt power plant. ExxonMobil is an industry leader in the application of cogeneration technology with interests in almost 5 gigawatts of capacity across 100 installations.

Maximize Resource Value through High-Impact Technologies
Our commitment to technology provides a competitive advantage in exploration, project development, oil and gas recovery, and production operations. Using our integrated technologies, we have achieved advances in deepwater, arctic, heavy oil, and most recently, liquefied natural gas development, enabling us to unlock resource potential previously considered uneconomic. This same multidisciplinary approach will allow us to achieve advances in the development of unconventional gas both in North America and around the globe.
   ExxonMobil is developing integrated technologies for optimizing locations to drill and produce shale gas safely and economically. This research ranges from the effectiveness of hydraulic fractures in well stimulation to the prediction of shale gas properties from stratigraphic models. Our research is being assisted by the integration of knowledge and extensive data from our recently expanded unconventional portfolio.
Advancing Integrated Technologies to Develop Shale Gas Resources
Proprietary technologies in basin analysis and stratigraphy lay the foundation for predicting the occurrence of shale gas plays in sedimentary basins. ExxonMobil has new technology for reconstructing the movement of tectonic plates in
Integrated technologies provide ExxonMobil with advantaged business solutions.
three dimensions. Our reconstructions are now more realistic because they incorporate deformation of the crust within the plates. This approach provides better predictions of subsidence, uplift, and heat flow, which are key controls on the types of sediments deposited in a basin. These new capabilities enhance our understanding of regional geology and are especially useful in exploring new basins for all types of resources.
Our geologists apply ExxonMobil's expertise in the stratigraphy of fine-grained rocks to predict the occurrence, distribution, and properties of organic-rich shales in the context of regional geology. Our stratigraphic tools support early recognition of shale gas plays and the prediction of optimal drilling locations. They help explain the variations in shale gas reservoir properties that can impact well performance and thus contribute to optimizing development strategies. Our emerging technology in fracture prediction from seismic data and new laboratory capabilities for measuring ultra-low permeabilities also play a key role in our understanding of these resources.
ExxonMobil is using seismic technology in innovative ways to predict the distribution of natural fractures, which are important pathways for hydrocarbon flow in tight reservoirs. This technology uses selected seismic responses to predict the intensity and orientation of fractures. These predictions help identify areas of enhanced flow and contribute to optimizing well placement and well paths. This emerging seismic technology is being applied to carbonate reservoirs in the Middle East and is contributing to the definition of fractured, shale gas plays in North America. In addition, ExxonMobil is using an advanced, specially designed seismic survey to characterize fracture networks in tight gas sandstones in Colorado.
Prediction of Natural Fractures from Seismic Data
 - 
ExxonMobil is extending our distinguishing capabilities in laboratory flow studies to ultra-low permeability rocks, such as shales that serve as tight gas reservoirs. We use state-of-the-art equipment, pioneering analytical techniques, and best practices based on decades of experience to study complex flow through rock samples in the laboratory. We simulate actual reservoir conditions and measure the relative amounts of oil, gas, and water that flow through samples during the tests. The results are critical to quantifying hydrocarbon flow during a field's life and have helped define, develop, and deplete reservoirs in over 40 countries. ExxonMobil is developing new laboratory methods and tools for flow studies of shale gas reservoirs to use in developing our expanded unconventional portfolio.

Rock Properties from Logs in High-Angle and Horizontal Wells
ExxonMobil has developed leading-edge technology for evaluating rock and fluid properties in high-angle and horizontal (HA/HZ) wells. Logging tools have traditionally been calibrated to vertical wells, so tool responses need to be corrected for deviated and horizontal well paths. We have developed proprietary software that corrects well log responses for wellbore geometry and the physics of logging tools, resulting in better quantitative interpretations of rock and fluid properties for use in all business stages. The state-of-the-art workflow and patented techniques calculate accurate in-place hydrocarbon reserves using log data from HA/HZ wells, which can provide business advantages in a variety of settings.
Improving Reservoir Recovery
In many of ExxonMobil's carbonate assets, acid injection treatments are used to increase the connectivity of the well to the reservoir by creating long, highly conductive conduits called "wormholes." We are applying a suite of leading-edge technologies to gain key insights into the growth of wormholes and their effects on long-term well performance. Laboratory experiments, which used rock samples approximately 2000 times the volume of those used previously, produced wormhole networks on a scale that permitted more thorough investigation of their growth in three dimensions. Detailed images of the wormholes were obtained by contracting with the U.S. Air Force for access to one of the most powerful X-ray scanners in the world. These 3D images have been integrated with ExxonMobil's expertise in computational modeling to understand how the wormholes promote flow into a well. Establishing an effective, flow-efficient connection to the reservoir is a key element in maximizing and sustaining production.
Stimulating Flow in Carbonates
 - 
We continue to pursue additional technologies for enhancing bitumen recovery. These new processes focus on reducing environmental impact and improving long-term access to heavy oil resources. Unlike many other heavy oil technologies, ExxonMobil's Cyclic Solvent Process (CSP) is a nonthermal recovery process. A cycle consists of injecting a solvent through a horizontal wellbore to reduce the viscosity of heavy oil in place, followed by production of a solvent-oil mixture through the same wellbore; this process is then repeated. The primary solvents considered for this process consist of naturally occurring light hydrocarbon solvents, such as propane. CSP has the potential to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions over existing thermal recovery techniques, while greatly reducing energy and water use. It may also provide access to additional resources, such as reservoirs with thin pay zones or low bitumen saturations, which are challenging to produce with current thermal recovery processes.

Continuing to Extend Drilling Boundaries
ExxonMobil has developed a borehole management process that integrates innovative technologies and operating practices to continue drilling longer, more deviated wells in greater contact with the reservoir. One of the challenges in drilling extended-reach wells is managing the behavior of cuttings in the borehole. The accumulation of cuttings can interfere with moving the drillstring and inserting casing. ExxonMobil is using leading-edge laboratory capabilities and advanced computational techniques to simulate the downhole process of pulling and pushing pipe through accumulations of cuttings. This research helps optimize the amount of cuttings in wells to keep boreholes stable, smooth, and serviceable during the drilling process. Faster, more efficient removal of cuttings increases the rate of penetration realized by ExxonMobil's process and technology for managing downhole vibrations.

Qatar evaluated the effectiveness of chlorophyll fluorometry in monitoring the health of sea grass colonies and coral reefs. This noninvasive technique measures fluorescence to determine the health of sea grasses and symbiotic algae, which affect the health of the host corals. The study conducted detailed visual assessments of ecosystems along with measurements of seawater temperature, underwater light intensity, and water quality. Through this work, we have demonstrated that chlorophyll fluorometry can improve our ability to monitor the health of these sensitive ecosystems.
ExxonMobil continues to realize value through external research collaborations with universities, national laboratories, and other industries to provide leading-edge technology. We use this approach to pursue well-aligned, novel opportunities that can accelerate our research. These collaborative efforts can incorporate a broad range of disciplines and engage various types of organizations around the world. For example, ExxonMobil developed and directs an alliance with universities in Europe and the United States to research the fundamental controls on flow in carbonates. This multidisciplinary network has stimulated innovation and delivered proprietary advances for use in next-generation methods for geologic modeling and flow simulation. ExxonMobil is also benefiting from technical collaboration between the oil-and-gas and medical communities in Houston, Texas. This creative, interdisciplinary initiative has produced a flow simulation and visualization capability useful in flow assurance studies, ranging from the effectiveness of artificial heart valves to progressing leading-edge sand-screen technology for wellbores.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
By 2030, energy demand for transportation fuels is forecast to increase nearly 40 percent versus 2005. This increase will be driven by growth in developing countries, while demand in the more mature, developed markets is projected to be essentially flat as improvements in fuel economy and transportation system efficiencies offset demand from vehicle growth.
Despite the potential positive effects of this energy demand growth in our Downstream business, we expect the challenging business environment for refining to continue, reflecting the increase in global refining capacity and regulatory-related policies. However, ExxonMobil's business model, coupled with our strengths, is designed to capture strong margins at the top of the business cycle and outperform competition at the bottom of the cycle. Our results demonstrate the resiliency of our business. Additionally, business restructuring and disciplined investments continue to position our businesses to capture growth opportunities worldwide over the long term. A good example of this is our ongoing migration to less capital-intensive fuels distribution channels like the branded wholesaler model in the United States.
Our Downstream strategies are effective across a range of industry conditions, and our success is due to our continued commitment to these strategies throughout the business cycle. The Downstream has continued to deliver industry-leading returns due, in large part, to strong operational performance, disciplined capital management, industry-leading level of integration, and leading-edge proprietary technologies.

Lead Industry in Efficiency and Effectiveness
We achieve industry-leading cost performance by reducing energy use, leveraging our global scale and integration, and deploying our leading-edge technologies to generate cost efficiencies.
ExxonMobil captures cost savings through economies of scale, centralized support activities, global work processes, and reliable operations. For example, we have shared organizations that support operations at our integrated refining and chemical sites, and we continue to progress our Global Manufacturing Training initiative to improve overall workforce productivity. We are also implementing new maintenance technologies to help improve productivity and reduce costs. We are able to supply our manufacturing sites with lower-cost materials and services by capitalizing on our purchasing scale, market intelligence, global best practices, and a strong partnership with other ExxonMobil business units.
Cost Efficiencies
We improve margins by focusing on economically increasing production, reducing raw material costs, and capturing higher product realizations. We focus on maximizing the economic utilization of our existing refining capacity by improving reliability, eliminating operating constraints, and expanding market outlets. We continue to upgrade our facilities and apply technology to increase raw material processing flexibility and to produce higher-value products. For example, ExxonMobil is an industry leader in processing "challenged crudes," running over 60 percent more than industry. These crudes are typically more difficult to handle or process because they have properties such as acid corrosivity, high nitrogen content, and other impurities. Because of these characteristics, these crudes are sold at a discount, providing a raw material cost advantage. Another measure of raw material flexibility is the number of crudes that are new to each refinery. In 2010, we processed 130 crudes new to individual sites.
Margin Improvement
Our marketing businesses continue to implement initiatives to achieve cost-efficiency improvements that have more than offset inflationary pressures over the last several years. Simultaneously, we are restructuring the business model towards more efficient and effective distribution channels. Since 2006, Fuels Marketing operating expenditures (at constant foreign exchange rates and energy price) have declined more than 15 percent. Our Lubes and Specialties business has become more efficient by consolidating customer service centers, rationalizing blend plants, and streamlining our product offering while continuing to capture high-value growth opportunities.

Energy represents about one-third of the operating cost of a manufacturing facility and remains a focus area for cost efficiency. For example, ExxonMobil's proprietary Global Energy Management System focuses on opportunities that reduce
Energy Initiatives
the energy consumed at our refineries, lube oil blend plants, and chemical sites. Since 2002, we have improved refinery energy efficiency by an average of 7.5 percent with a goal of achieving a 10-percent reduction by 2012 across our worldwide manufacturing operations. Improved energy efficiency is a key contributor to our cost performance, and we have consistently outpaced industry in this area.
To further optimize our energy consumption, we continue to make significant investments in cogeneration facilities that simultaneously produce electricity and useful heat or steam. With the latest technology, cogeneration is significantly more efficient than traditional methods of producing steam and power separately, and results in lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cost. Additionally, through an ongoing initiative of plant optimization and upgrading of high energy-consuming steam and compressed air equipment, we have reduced overall GHG emissions from our network of finished lube oil blend plants by nearly 20 percent since 2004.

Integration between business functions is a competitive advantage that delivers value through identification of attractive investment opportunities, implementation of best practices, application of advantaged technologies, and optimization of our operations.
In the Downstream, we use an integrated approach to develop new business opportunities and optimize our global operations. For example, in support of the Upstream, our global supply organization manages the economic placement of over 2 million barrels per day of equity crude. At our manufacturing sites, we use computer models to optimize operations on an integrated basis to produce fuels products, chemicals, lubricants, and asphalts. Our refineries are more than 60-percent larger than the industry average with more conversion capacity and more integration with chemical and lubes operations.
Worldwide Optimization
Downstream cross-functional teams work together to improve the value of ExxonMobil's refined products. Integrated Business Teams combine manufacturing, supply, technology, logistics, and marketing expertise to optimize margin capture and maximize shareholder value. These teams evaluate product placement alternatives in each market around the world, optimizing sales to higher-value channels. As a result, we have identified and implemented several initiatives to optimize domestic and export sales mix in several of our integrated markets. This has improved refinery and terminal utilization and helped us capture profitable domestic accounts for our Fuels Marketing business. Common work processes, tools, and analytical methodologies enable us to achieve these results. Integration across our businesses also allows us to capture benefits by sharing best practices. Using global support services as well as common systems and processes, we are able to leverage the expertise of our employees around the world.
Our global scale and level of integration are structural advantages that are difficult for competitors to replicate.

Invest for Resilient, Advantaged Returns
ExxonMobil's capital management strategy takes a disciplined and long-term approach to managing capital employed while sustaining industry-leading returns. This approach combines selective and resilient investments with disciplined capital and portfolio management to optimize the productivity and profitability of our business.
ExxonMobil has a disciplined approach to investments to ensure our projects are advantaged to support growth and add value. For example, we have invested over $1 billion to increase supply of ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) in support of forecasted long-term demand growth. In 2010, we completed facilities at our Baytown, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and, Antwerp, Belgium, refineries to increase the supply of ULSD by more than 6 million gallons per day. In 2011, we anticipate providing additional supply of lower-sulfur gasoline and diesel with the start-up of a unit and a distillate hydrofiner upgrade at our Sriracha, Thailand, refinery. We have also invested in expansions and low-cost debottleneck projects to increase capacity and improve product yields at existing sites that generate attractive returns over a range of market conditions. Recently, we expanded hydrotreater capacity and distillate yield at our Port Jerome-Gravenchon, France, refinery. In addition, by building on our strengths, including supply reliability, product technology, and technical expertise, our Lubricants and Specialties business is well-positioned to grow in the high-value synthetics sectors and in developing markets such as China, India, and Russia. To sustain this growth, we continue to progress disciplined investments in blending capacity and branded marketing outlets, as well as leverage our world-class brands and relationships with equipment manufacturers.
Selective and Resilient Investments
We are the most capital-efficient of our peer group, consistently generating advantaged returns on capital employed.
SCANfining
We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing capital employed, including selective and resilient investments, asset divestments, and sound working capital practices. For example, in our Fuels Marketing business, we continue to reduce overall capital employed through sound accounts receivable management and portfolio highgrading. By consistently implementing this approach, the capital productivity of Fuels Marketing, defined as volume sold by unit of capital employed, has more than doubled since 2006.
Disciplined Capital Management
 
UpClose:
Disciplined Portfolio Management
We continuously evaluate our assets and take appropriate action to maximize long-term shareholder value. For example, during the stronger refining margin period a few years ago, we did not greatly expand our Downstream operations. Instead, we have been making changes to the Downstream portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Since 2000, we have divested our interest in 11 refineries, over 5000 miles of pipeline assets, about 140 product terminals, as well as a net reduction of about 40 lube oil blend plants and more than 20,000 retail sites.
In 2010, we sold our interest in the Dunkirk, France, lube oil refinery and continued to progress our retail restructuring activities to convert to a more efficient branded wholesaler model in the United States. These changes further enhance portfolio integration of our downstream assets.
We have reduced our capital employed since 2000 while the average of our competitors' capital employed has increased.

Maximize Value from Leading-Edge Technology
ExxonMobil's Downstream research and technology portfolio encompasses a broad range of activities to address business challenges. We focus on developing and deploying high-impact technologies that maximize the efficiency and value of our existing assets as well as identifying game-changing technologies to sustain competitive advantage in both conventional downstream and emerging areas.
ExxonMobil operates one of the world's largest and most complex supply chains, executing manufacturing operations on a global scale. Technical experts throughout our organization use advanced optimization models to assist decision making in complex and time-constrained activities such as transportation scheduling. For example, we schedule ship voyages and cargo handling with models that include proprietary algorithms and advanced solvers that optimize loading and discharge operations to match supply availability with refinery capabilities, meeting our needs at the lowest cost.
Supply and Manufacturing Optimization
We take advantage of real-time models to optimize our ability to efficiently meet product specifications within refinery product pools. Molecule-based models examine the trade-offs among potential blend streams from a variety of sources. These models optimize site distillation and conversion unit operations to maximize overall production of on-specification products like ultra-low sulfur diesel, ultimately enhancing product yield and refinery margins. Our fundamental technical advantages include detailed molecular characterization of feedstocks, intermediate streams, and products, along with strong expertise in process dynamics like fluid flow and heat transfer. These advantages underpin our ability to gain maximum value from optimization technologies.
Our fundamental molecular-level understanding drives advanced catalytic and modeling technologies that enable optimized refining operations, formulation of fuels that clean vital engine parts, and development of unique lubricants like
Mobil 1
and
Mobil SHC
products.
Catalysts are key contributors to value capture by enabling cost-effective and efficient processing of petroleum products and petrochemicals. Since the 1940s, ExxonMobil has had a tradition of discovering, developing, and deploying new catalysts in processes such as Fluid Catalytic Cracking, hydrocracking, hydrotreating, lubricant dewaxing, and hydrofinishing. Recently, we have applied high throughput experimentation tools to accelerate new catalyst discovery. These efforts are leading to improved catalysts with the ability to process heavier feedstocks and to tolerate increased levels of catalyst deactivators like nitrogen and sulfur, while maintaining high-conversion activity to make desired products. We are continuing to enhance these industry-leading catalyst discovery capabilities by using state-of-the-art quantum chemical and molecular modeling techniques. These approaches provide us with a fundamental understanding of factors influencing the effectiveness of catalysts. When coupled with our molecule-based refinery process modeling, this enables us to further accelerate the development of improved catalysts.

With the opening of a new greenhouse research and testing facility in La Jolla, California, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company and Synthetic Genomics Inc. (SGI) have entered an important second stage in the collaboration to develop strains of algae that could produce refinery feedstock and transportation fuels. The high-tech greenhouse supplements ongoing laboratory activity with additional research in a more real-world environment. Here, scientists and engineers experiment with different algae growth systems, light levels, temperature conditions, carbon dioxide amounts, and nutrient concentrations to better evaluate whether large-scale volumes of affordable biofuel can be made from algae. They will also identify the most robust strains, naturally occurring and engineered, that exhibit the optimal, sought-after characteristics of growth, bio-oil composition, and recoverability.
Algae Biofuels
This work is a long-term initiative, and ExxonMobil and SGI have made good progress to date. SGI has isolated and developed a large number of candidate algae strains and identified conditions under which the strains can be made more productive. ExxonMobil has evaluated various production technologies and is assessing which approaches have the greatest commercial potential. The next phase is to build a larger outdoor test facility. Work on this facility has already begun in parallel with the research now being advanced in the greenhouse, and it is anticipated to open in mid-2011.

We manage our capital project portfolio to enhance our access to advantaged feedstocks, deploy lower-cost processes, and grow premium products. Our advantaged projects deliver superior returns across the business cycle and are durable over a wide range of market conditions.
We have a healthy pipeline of projects to capture growth while adding value to the Corporation. We continue to invest in the growth of our specialty businesses, as well as develop projects around the world to enhance our feedstock flexibility.
Value through Disciplined Investment
Energy and efficiency projects make up an appreciable portion of our investment. We continue to invest in technology to make further breakthroughs in products and processes to maintain and extend our competitive advantage.
Through 2020, we expect more than 60 percent of global petrochemical demand growth will occur in Asia Pacific, with over one-third in China. We plan to support this growth while adding shareholder value.
Well-Positioned for Asia Pacific Growth
Since start-up in the third quarter of 2009, our joint venture in Fujian, China, has sold more than 3 million tonnes of product.
This world-scale, fully integrated petrochemical complex is well-positioned to meet demand in the rapidly growing Chinese market.
In Singapore, construction is well-advanced on one of the largest projects ever executed by ExxonMobil. The project will more than double the site's steam-cracking capacity, provide unparalleled feedstock flexibility, and be energy efficient. The significant increase in commodity and specialty product capacity will enable us to capture both growth and value. When the project is complete, Singapore will be the site of ExxonMobil's largest integrated complex in the world.
Our recently commissioned Shanghai Technology Center will support our business in meeting the growing premium product demand in Asia Pacific.
Detailed studies are progressing for a major expansion of our joint venture in Saudi Arabia to develop specialty products for the auto industry.
We are progressing other to develop advantaged projects that would be well-positioned to supply the demand growth in Asia Pacific.

Frequently Used Terms
Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil's key business and financial performance measures and other terms. These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation. In the case of financial measures that we believe constitute "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, we provide a reconciliation to the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure and other information required by that rule.
EARNINGS EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS
In addition to reporting U.S. GAAP defined net income, ExxonMobil also presents a measure of earnings that excludes earnings from special items quantified and described in our quarterly and annual earnings press releases. Earnings excluding special items is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is included to facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods. A reconciliation to net income attributable to ExxonMobil is shown on page 16. We also refer to earnings excluding special items as normalized earnings. Earnings per share amounts use the same average common shares outstanding as used for the calculation of earnings per common share and earnings per common share  assuming dilution.
OPERATING COSTS
Operating costs are the combined total of production, manufacturing, selling, general, administrative, exploration, depreciation, and depletion expenses from the Consolidated Statement of Income and ExxonMobil's share of similar costs for equity companies. Operating costs are the costs during the period to produce, manufacture, and otherwise prepare the company's products for sale  including energy costs, staffing, maintenance, and other costs to explore for and produce oil and gas, and operate refining and chemical plants. Distribution and marketing expenses are also included. Operating costs exclude the cost of raw materials, taxes, and interest expense. These expenses are on a before-tax basis. While ExxonMobil's management is responsible for all revenue and expense elements of net income, operating costs, as defined below, represent the expenses most directly under management's control. Information regarding these costs is, therefore, useful for investors and ExxonMobil management in evaluating management's performance.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
Shareholder return measures the change in value of an investment in stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. We calculate shareholder return over a particular measurement period by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period. For this purpose, we assume dividends are reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the same time actual dividends are paid. Shareholder return is usually quoted on an annualized basis.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES (Capex)
Capital and exploration expenditures are the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the Summary Statement of Income. ExxonMobil's Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil's management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.
CAPITAL EMPLOYED
Capital employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil's net share of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes ExxonMobil's share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil's share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.
RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE)
Return on average capital employed is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning- and end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil's share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation's total ROCE is net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry, both to evaluate management's performance and to demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long term. Additional measures, which are more cash flow-based, are used to make investment decisions.

ENTITLEMENT VOLUME EFFECTS
Production Sharing Contract Net Interest Reductions
 - 
Production Sharing Contract (PSC) net interest reductions are contractual reductions in ExxonMobil's share of production volumes covered by PSCs. These reductions typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve thresholds as specified in the PSCs. Once a net interest reduction has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
Price and spend impacts on volumes are fluctuations in ExxonMobil's share of production volumes caused by changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. For example, at higher prices fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for crude oil or natural gas.
Price and Spend Impacts on Volumes
 - 
HEAVY OIL AND OIL SANDS
Heavy oil, for the purpose of this report, includes heavy oil, extra heavy oil, and bitumen, as defined by the World Petroleum Congress in 1987 based on American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity and viscosity at reservoir conditions. Heavy oil has an API gravity between 10 and 22.3 degrees. The API gravity of extra heavy oil and bitumen is less than 10 degrees. Extra heavy oil has a viscosity less than 10 thousand centipoise, whereas the viscosity of bitumen is greater than 10 thousand centipoise. The term "oil sands" is used to indicate heavy oil (generally bitumen) that is recovered in a mining operation.
EXPLORATION RESOURCE ADDITION COST
Exploration resource addition cost per oil-equivalent barrel is a performance measure that is calculated using the Exploration portion of Upstream capital and exploration expenditures divided by exploration resource additions (in oil-equivalent barrels). ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries, and the non-proved portion of discovered resources that were acquired, as exploration resource additions. Exploration resource additions include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but which ExxonMobil believes will likely be moved into the proved reserves category and produced in the future. The impact of the XTO Energy Inc. merger transaction is excluded from this calculation.
PROVED RESERVES
Proved reserves in this publication for 2009 and later years are based on current SEC definitions, but for prior years, the referenced proved reserve volumes are determined on bases that differ from SEC definitions in effect at the time. Specifically, for years prior to 2009 included in our five-year average replacement ratio, reserves are determined using the SEC pricing basis but including oil sands and our pro-rata share of equity company reserves for all periods. Prior to 2009, oil sands and equity company reserves were not included in proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC. In addition, prior to 2009, the SEC defined price as the market price on December 31; beginning in 2009, the SEC changed the definition to the average of the market prices on the first day of each calendar month during the year. For years prior to 2009 included in our 17 straight years of at least 100-percent replacement, reserves are determined using the price and cost assumptions we use in managing the business, not the historical prices used in SEC definitions. Reserves determined on ExxonMobil's pricing basis also include oil sands and equity company reserves for all periods.
RESOURCES, RESOURCE BASE, AND RECOVERABLE RESOURCES
Resources, resource base, recoverable resources, recoverable oil, recoverable hydrocarbons, and similar terms used in this report are the total remaining estimated quantities of oil and gas that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. ExxonMobil refers to new discoveries and acquisitions of discovered resources as resource additions. The resource base includes quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but which ExxonMobil believes will likely be moved into the proved reserves category and produced in the future. The term "resource base" is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as "probable" or "possible" reserves.
PROVED RESERVES REPLACEMENT RATIO
The reserves replacement ratio is calculated for a specified period utilizing the applicable proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided by oil-equivalent production. See "Proved Reserves" above.

PROVED RESERVES REPLACEMENT COSTS
Proved reserves replacement costs per oil-equivalent barrel is a performance measure ratio. Proved reserves replacement costs per barrel are costs incurred in property acquisition and exploration, plus costs incurred in development activities, divided by proved oil-equivalent reserves additions, excluding sales. Unless otherwise specified, ExxonMobil reports these costs based on proved reserves using SEC historical prices and costs. See "Proved Reserves" on previous page.
CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES
Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant and equipment from the Summary Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow is the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation's assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation's strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
The Corporation distributes cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share purchases. Shares are purchased both to reduce shares outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs. For purposes of calculating distributions to shareholders, the Corporation only includes the cost of those shares purchased to reduce shares outstanding.
