Other Events
On June 30, 2011, a state district court jury in Baltimore County, Maryland returned a verdict against Exxon Mobil Corporation in a case involving an accidental 26,000 gallon gasoline leak at a suburban Baltimore service station. The verdict included approximately $497 million in compensatory damages and approximately $1.045 billion in punitive damages in a finding that ExxonMobil fraudulently misled the plaintiff-residents about the events leading up to the leak, the leak's discovery, and the nature and extent of any groundwater contamination. ExxonMobil believes the verdict is not justified by the evidence and that the amount of the award is grossly excessive and unconstitutional. ExxonMobil will appeal the decision following entry of final judgment. In a prior trial involving the same leak, the jury awarded plaintiff-residents compensatory damages but decided against punitive damages.  That case is on appeal.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
