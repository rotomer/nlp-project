2Q11 Investor Relations Data Summary.

EXHIBIT 99.1
:
EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED
"ExxonMobil recorded strong results during the second quarter of 2011, while investing at a record level of over $10 billion to develop new supplies of energy to meet growing world demand.
Second quarter earnings of $10.7 billion were up 41% from the second quarter of 2010, reflecting higher crude oil and natural gas realizations, improved Downstream results and continued strength in Chemicals.  First half 2011 earnings of $21.3 billion increased 54% over the first half of 2010.
In the second quarter, capital and exploration expenditures were a record $10.3 billion, up 58% from the second quarter of 2010.
Oil-equivalent production increased by 10% over the second quarter of 2010, driven by our world-class assets in Qatar and our growing unconventional gas portfolio.
The Corporation returned over $7 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding."
Second Quarter 2011 vs. Second Quarter 2010
Upstream earnings were $8,541 million, up $3,205 million from the second quarter of 2010.  Higher liquids and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $3.6 billion. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $480 million.  
On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 10% from the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up over 12%.
Liquids production totaled 2,351 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), up 26 kbd from the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was up 4%, as increased production in Qatar, the U.S. and Iraq more than offset field decline.
 
Second quarter natural gas production was 12,267 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), up 2,242 mcfd from the second quarter of 2010,driven by additional U.S. unconventional gas volumes and project ramp-ups in Qatar.
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,449 million, $584 million higher than the second quarter of 2010.  Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $7,092 million, up $2,621 million from last year.
Downstream earnings of $1,356 million were up $136 million from the second quarter of 2010.  Margins increased earnings by $60 million.  Positive volume and mix effects increased earnings by $150 million, while all other items decreased earnings by $70 million.  Petroleum product sales of 6,331 kbd were 27 kbd higher than last year's second quarter.
Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $734 million, up $294 million from the second quarter of 2010.  Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $622 million were $158 million lower than last year.
Chemical earnings of $1,321 million were $47 million lower than the second quarter of 2010.  Improved margins increased earnings by $120 million, while lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $90 million.  Other items, mainly unfavorable tax effects, decreased earnings by $80 million.  Second quarter prime product sales of 6,181 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 315 kt lower than last year's second quarter.
Corporate and financing expenses were $538 million, up $174 million from the second quarter of 2010 due to the absence of favorable 2010 tax items.
During the second quarter of 2011, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 67 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $5.5 billion.  These purchases included $5 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans and programs.  Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal $5 billion in the third quarter of 2011.  Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
First Half 2011 vs. First Half 2010
Earnings of $21,330 million increased $7,470 million from 2010.  Earnings per share increased 47% to $4.32.  
Upstream earnings were $17,216 million, up $6,066 million from 2010.  Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $6.2 billion.  Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $710 million, while all other items, mainly gains from asset sales, increased earnings by $600 million.
On an oil-equivalent basis, production was up 10% compared to the same period in 2010.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up 12%.
Liquids production of 2,375 kbd increased 5 kbd compared with 2010.  Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was up 3%, as higher volumes from Qatar and the U.S. more than offset field decline.
Natural gas production of 13,390 mcfd increased 2,538 mcfd from 2010, driven by additional U.S. unconventional gas volumes and project ramp-ups in Qatar.
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2011 were $2,728 million, an increase of $772 million.  Earnings outside the U.S. were $14,488 million, up $5,294 million.
Downstream earnings of $2,455 million increased $1,198 million from 2010.  Margins increased earnings by $510 million.  Positive volume and mix effects increased earnings by $520 million, while all other items, mainly favorable foreign exchange effects, increased earnings by $170 million.

U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,428 million, up $1,048 million from 2010.  Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,027 million, $150 million higher than last year.

Cautionary statement
Statements relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking statements.  Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in long-term oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas industry; unforeseen technical difficulties; political events or disturbances; reservoir performance; the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the "investors" section of our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2010 Form 10-K.  We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.  References to quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as "proved reserves" under SEC definitions.
Frequently used terms
Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.  Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods.  Reconciliation to net income attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.  The release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales.  Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities.  A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II.  Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available through the "investors" section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
Reference to Earnings
References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.  Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, special items, earnings excluding special items, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
