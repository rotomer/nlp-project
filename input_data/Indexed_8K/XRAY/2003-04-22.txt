Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits (a) Financial Statements - Not applicable. (b) Exhibits: 99.1 The Dentsply International Inc. first quarter 2003 sales and earnings release issued April 22, 2003 as referenced in Item 9. Item 9. - Regulation FD Disclosure. The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 9, "Regulation FD Disclosure" and Item 12, "Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On April 22, 2003, the Company issued a press release disclosing its first-quarter 2003 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content. Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metals to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. DENTSPLY INTERNATIONAL INC (Company) /s/ Bret W. Wise Bret W. Wise Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Date: April 22, 2003

Miles, II, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented that "the Company is continuing to benefit from several new product introductions. Both our Cercon Smart Ceramic restorative product and our Eclipse Prosthetic Resin System are experiencing rapid growth and strong support from dentists and laboratory customers. In January we introduced our Aquasil Ultra impression material in the United States and have already successfully converted approximately 8,000 new users to this revolutionary material - a spectacular product launch. In addition, our new In-Ovation-R and Mystique orthodontic brackets are experiencing extraordinary growth. Most importantly, DENTSPLY has a very full product pipeline and numerous new products that we expect to commercialize in the second and third quarters of this year.
