Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits (a) Financial Statements - Not applicable. (b) Exhibits: 99.1 The Dentsply International Inc. second quarter 2003 sales and earnings release issued July 30, 2003 as referenced in Item 12. Item 12. - Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 12, "Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On July 30, 2003, the Company issued a press release disclosing its second quarter 2003 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content. Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metals to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. DENTSPLY INTERNATIONAL INC (Company) /s/ Bret W. Wise Bret W. Wise Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Date: July 30, 2003

DENTSPLY NEWS For further Information Contact: Bret W. Wise FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (717) 849-4718 DENTSPLY International INC. REPORTS STRONG RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER 2003 York, PA - July 30, 2003 -- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ -XRAY) today announced sales for the second quarter of 2003 were a record $417.9 million, an increase of 9.7% compared to the second quarter of 2002. Sales excluding precious metal content rose 10.9% to $371.7 million compared to $335.2 million in the 2002 period. Net income for the second quarter 2003 was $44.2 million, up 20.1% over the prior year and earnings per share were $.55, a 19.6% increase over 2002. Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $814.1 million, a 10.6% increase compared to $735.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2002. Sales excluding precious metals for the 2003 period were $713.5 million, an 11.3% increase compared to the 2002 period. Net income for the six month period in 2003 was $82.5 million, a 18.0% increase over the prior period, and earnings per diluted share were $1.03 per share, an increase of 17.0%, compared to $0.88 per share in the 2002 period. The Company recorded pretax charges of $5.5 million in the second quarter and total pretax charges of $9.6 million in the six month period of 2003, related primarily to accounting for inventory, receivables and prepaid expenses at three locations impacted by integration activities following the completion of acquisitions in 2001. The largest portion of these charges relate to an inventory adjustment at one of these divisions, confirmed by a physical inventory that the Company initiated and completed in the second quarter. Also in the second quarter, the Company initiated and completed an independent evaluation of its accounting practices for establishing reserves. As a result of this evaluation, the Company identified and reversed to income $4.4 million of reserves that should have been reversed in prior periods or were erroneously established. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed $2.4 million of product return reserves that were recorded in excess of appropriate amounts. The impact of the establishment and reversal of these reserves was not material to the results of operations in prior periods and will not be material to the results of operations in 2003. As a result of this evaluation, the Company is revising certain procedures for identifying and estimating reserves to improve the accuracy of its accounting for loss contingencies in the future.
John C. Miles, II, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented that "the Company's growth continues to be driven by new product introductions over the past 18 months, particularly those in dental consumables. I am particularly pleased with the rapid sales growth of several of our new product introductions including Cercon, our all ceramic crown and bridge consumable and Aquasil Ultra, our new impression material. Our new product pipeline remains robust and we anticipate several additional key product introductions in the second half of 2003."
