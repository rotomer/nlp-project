Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits (a) Financial Statements - Not applicable. (b) Exhibits: 99.1 The Dentsply International Inc. fourth quarter 2003 sales and earnings release issued January 27, 2004 as referenced in Item 12. Item 12. - Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 12, "Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On January 27, 2004, the Company issued a press release disclosing its fourth quarter 2003 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content. Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metals to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(NASDAQ-XRAY) today announced record sales and earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003. Sales in 2003 increased 10.8% to $1.57 billion compared to $1.42 billion reported for 2002. Sales excluding precious metals, increased 11.0% for all of 2003. Sales growth was aided by currency translation as the US dollar weakened throughout 2003. Net income for 2003 was $174.2 million, a 17.7% increase compared to 2002 and earnings per diluted share were $2.16, a 16.7% increase compared to $1.85 in 2002. Income from continuing operations was $169.9 million for 2003, $2.11 per diluted share, an increase of 18.2% compared to income from continuing operations of $143.6 million, $1.80 per diluted share for all of 2002. The 2003 period includes pre-tax charges of $3.7 million relating to restructuring activities to consolidate the Company's lab business in the United States and the impairment of certain investments in emerging dental technology that the Company has concluded are no longer viable. The 2003 period also includes pre-tax gains of $7.4 million relating to the Company's investment in PracticeWorks which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 2002 period includes a pre-tax gain on an insurance settlement and the reversal of a restructuring reserve of $2.7 million. The Company previously announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its dental equipment business in a transaction that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2004. In addition, the Company recently announced that it was discontinuing its dental needle business in 2004. Both of these businesses are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Income from discontinued operations was $4.3 million for both 2003 and 2002. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 increased 11.9% to a record of $429.7 million compared to $384.0 million in 2002. Sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 11.4% in the quarter to $372.0 million. Sales growth in the quarter was positively influenced by the weakening of the US dollar versus certain key foreign currencies.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $50.4 million, a 19.2% increase compared to 2002, and earnings per diluted share were $.62, a 17.0% increase compared to $.53 in the fourth quarter of 2002. Income from continuing operations was $48.7 million, $.60 per diluted share, for the 2003 fourth quarter, a 19.4% increase compared to $40.8 million, $.51 per diluted share, for the 2002 period. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2003 includes the restructuring and other charges of $3.7 million mentioned above and a pre-tax gain on the PracticeWorks investment of $5.8 million realized during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations was $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to $1.5 million in the 2002 quarter. Gary K. Kunkle, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented that, "We are pleased to announce another year of record setting performance in 2003. This year we continued our strategic focus on developing new innovative products to improve the practice of dentistry. Recently, we announced that the Food and Drug Administration has approved Oraqix(R) our new dental anesthetic for periodontal treatment. This was a significant step in bringing this product to market in the United States. We now expect to launch Oraqix(R) in the United States in the second half of 2004. New product opportunities, combined with our expectations of accelerated growth in the dental consumables market and a recovery in the lab side of the market, position us well for continued strong results in 2004."
