Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits (a) Financial Statements - Not applicable. (b) Exhibits: 99.1 The Dentsply International Inc. first quarter 2004 sales and earnings release issued April 27, 2004 as referenced in Item 12. Item 12. - Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 12, "Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On April 27, 2004, the Company issued a press release disclosing its first quarter 2004 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content. Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

NEWS For Further Information Contact: Bret W. Wise FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (717) 849-4718 Dentsply International Inc. Reports Record First Quarter 2004 Sales and Earnings York, PA - April 27, 2004 -- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ-XRAY) today announced record sales and earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Net sales increased 11.9% to $415.4 million compared to $371.2 million reported for the first quarter of 2003. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 13.3% in the first quarter of 2004, reflecting an improvement in the rate of organic growth and the benefit of currency translation. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 was $88.8 million, or $1.09 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the quarter was $45.8 million, $0.56 per diluted share, an increase of 19.1% compared to income from continuing operations of $37.4 million, $0.47 per diluted share in 2003. The 2004 period includes pretax charges of $0.7 million relating to restructuring activities to consolidate the Company's United States laboratory businesses and a reduction in income taxes of $1.2 million related to tax matters from prior periods. The results for 2004 also include $0.53 per diluted share from discontinued operations, consisting primarily of the net gain on the sale of the Company's Gendex equipment business which was completed in February 2004. Gary K. Kunkle, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented that, "We are pleased by the record performance in the first quarter of 2004, particularly the improvement in overall sales growth. Our growth throughout Europe was exceptional and we benefited from a return to strong growth in Asia. While our sales growth in the United States remains below historic levels, market indicators suggest an improvement in this country as we move through the year." Mr. Kunkle also said, "In the first quarter we completed the relocation of our distribution center in Europe without disruption of deliveries to customers. This should allow us to improve future deliveries and customer service levels throughout the European Community where we have experienced significant growth over the past two years. The Company also expects to complete the consolidation of the U.S. laboratory businesses in the second quarter of 2004. We continue to see opportunities to grow earnings through combining resources and lowering costs. These conditions, combined with an outlook for stronger sales growth, position us well for another record year in 2004."
