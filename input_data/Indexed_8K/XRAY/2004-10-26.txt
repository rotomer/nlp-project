Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On October 26, 2004, the Company issued a press release disclosing its third quarter 2004 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content.

A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01.

Gary K.

We believe that these trends are short term and will not continue into 2005. Despite the temporary slow down in these regions, we are pleased to continue to deliver record earnings performance based on strong brand recognition for our key products and continued investment in new product innovations."
Mr. Kunkle also stated that, "We are also pleased to announce that we continue to gain access to new technologies that have exciting opportunities in dentistry. We recently completed an agreement with Doxa AB to develop and commercialize products within the dental field based upon Doxa's bioactive ceramic technology. The Doxa technology is designed to induce chemical integration between the material and dentition or bone structure. This is a perfect example of the kind of technology investment we are prepared to make in order to meet the future needs of dentistry. We have also accelerated our collaboration with Georgia Tech on several new potential product innovations, and during October we launched our new dental anesthetic, Oraqix. In total, we have launched eighteen new products through three quarters and expect to launch seven more new products during the fourth quarter of 2004."
