SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 ---------------------------------------------- CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report April 25, 2005 (Date of earliest event reported) DENTSPLY INTERNATIONAL INC (Exact name of Company as specified in charter) Delaware 0-16211 39-1434669 (State of Incorporation) (Commission (IRS Employer File Number) Identification No.) 221 West Philadelphia Street, York, Pennsylvania 17405 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) (717) 845-7511 (Company's telephone number including area code)
Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On April 25, 2005, the Company issued a press release disclosing its first quarter 2005 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content, which could be considered a measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (a non-GAAP measure). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits (a) Financial Statements - Not applicable. (b) Exhibits: 99.1 The Dentsply International Inc. first quarter 2005 sales and earnings release issued April 25, 2005 as referenced in Item 2.02.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

NEWS For Further Information Contact: William R. Jellison FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (717) 849-4243 DENTSPLY International Inc. Reports First Quarter 2005 Sales and Earnings York, PA - April 25, 2005 -- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ-XRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Net sales decreased 1.8% to $407.0 million compared to $414.4 million reported for the first quarter of 2004. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 3.0% in the first quarter of 2005. Sales, in the first quarter of 2005, were negatively affected by the implementation of changes in reimbursement for dental procedures in Germany, however, the balance of the world experienced positive internal growth. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2005 was $49.0 million, or $.60 per diluted share, an increase of 7.1% compared to income from continuing operations of $45.8 million, or $.56 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2004. Gary Kunkle, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented that, "The remarkably slow implementation of the dental reform within Germany has negatively impacted DENTSPLY's first quarter sales and earnings growth. Both patient confusion and significant delays in insurance claim processing associated with the reform has had negative repercussions throughout the German dental market, impacting the prosthetics market, (the dental lab industry) the hardest. We do believe, however, that there will be continued improvement throughout the year as these reforms are better understood and integrated." Mr. Kunkle also stated, "Outside of Germany, our growth remains encouraging, driven by new product introduction and our initiatives to improve sales force execution. We had the strongest quarterly growth in the United States that we have experienced since 2002. We are also very pleased with the continued growth in acceptance of Oraqix, our new needle-free local anesthetic for scaling and root planing procedures. Additionally, Dentsply has received approval of our new anesthetic manufacturing facility by the regulatory agencies for the U.K. and Australia, and has recently begun shipping to these regions. These positive trends along with other initiatives give us confidence in maintaining our earnings guidance of $2.59 - $2.63 for 2005."
