Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On July 26, 2005, the Company issued a press release disclosing its second quarter 2005 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content, which could be considered a measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (a non-GAAP measure). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01.

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 7.4% in the second quarter of 2005. Solid sales in a number of product areas and through most geographic regions continued to drive the business forward.

Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2005 was $57.9 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, an increase of 18.3% in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared to income from continuing operations of $49.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2004. The second quarter includes a net reduction of income tax expense of $1.8 million ($0.02 per diluted share) related to the settlement of audits of tax returns associated with prior periods. Gary Kunkle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated that, "Our continuous flow of new products remains a driving force in growing our businesses around the world. We have made considerable progress in our major product categories and markets during the second quarter. The German market, however, remains weak relative to 2004, but has shown significant improvement versus the first quarter of 2005." Mr. Kunkle also stated, "We are very pleased with the progress we have made during this period. This gives us further confidence in re-confirming our year-end 2005 earnings guidance of $2.59-2.63 per dilutive share. The Company is also anticipating taking advantage of repatriating foreign earnings under Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code however we are still finalizing our plans, including the size and timing of any repatriation.
