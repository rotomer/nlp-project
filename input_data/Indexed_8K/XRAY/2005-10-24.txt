Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On October 24, 2005, the Company issued a press release disclosing its third quarter 2005 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content and earnings from continuing operations excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations excluding certain unusual items is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01.

NEWS For Further Information Contact: William R. Jellison FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (717) 849-4243 DENTSPLY International Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2005 Results and Announces Asset Impairment Charge for the Period York, PA - October 24, 2005 -- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ-XRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. Net sales increased 6.7% to $416.0 million compared to $390.0 million reported for the third quarter of 2004. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 8.2% in the third quarter of 2005. Sales of all ceramic Cercon products, along with implants, orthodontics, and restorative products were especially strong in the period. Growth within Europe has continued to improve in the third quarter, although still impacted by the softness in the German lab business. In the third quarter of 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Pre-Approval Inspection of the Company's sterile filling plant under construction in Chicago. As a result of the inspection and comments received from the FDA, the Company has extended its estimate of the period required to ready the plant for approval and production of products for the U.S. and Japan until 2007. Modifications to the Company's plans for completion of the plant encompassed specific steps and procedures to address comments received from the FDA, and the extension of contract manufacturing agreements to provide continued supply of injectable anesthetic products for those markets during this extension period. In addition, the Company conducted an extensive review of all of its assumptions associated with the injectable products. Based on this review, the Company has concluded that the intangible asset associated with the injectable anesthetic products has become impaired in the third quarter of 2005. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $131.3 million ($111.6 million after tax) or $1.41 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005, and $1.37 on a year-to-date diluted earnings per share basis. Net loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 of $60.8 million, or $ 0.77 per diluted share was a decrease compared to net income from continuing operations of $46.4 million, or $0.57 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2004. The third quarter of 2005 included the pre-tax charge for impairment of the intangible asset of $131.3 million ($1.41 per share). The third quarter of 2004 included a reduction of income taxes of $2.8 million ($0.04 per diluted share) related to tax matters from prior periods and also included a pretax charge of $2.1 million ($0.02 per diluted share) related to restructuring activities. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding the items noted above for the third quarter of 2005 and 2004, which constitutes a non-GAAP measure, would have been $50.8 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005 compared to $0.55 in the third quarter of 2004, representing an increase of 14.5% in net income per dilutive share. . Gary Kunkle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated that, "The impairment charge on our injectable anesthetic products resulted from a comprehensive assessment of this business following comments received from the FDA in the third quarter of this year. This delay in approval will postpone receipt of the benefits of this facility for approximately one year moving it from our previous estimate of 2007 to 2008. Our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2005 with the impairment charge is projected at $1.24 - 1.28. Excluding the impact of the impairment charge, we are raising our full year 2005 guidance to $2.61 - $2.65. Additionally, the Company still anticipates taking advantage of repatriating foreign earnings under Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code, however, the size and timing of any repatriation will not be finalized until late November or early December. The tax impact of this potential repatriation is not included in our current earnings guidance for the year." Gary Kunkle also stated, "While this impairment charge is a setback for the reporting period, we are very pleased with the performances of our other businesses. The recently announced changes to our U.S. sales organization, our above-market performance in many product categories, and the continued improvement in the German market provide us with a high degree of confidence as we go forward."

Management believes that the presentation of some non-GAAP data provides investors with additional insight into the ongoing operations of the business. These measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, these measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided by other companies. The attached non-GAAP reconciliation schedules provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable measures determined in accordance with GAAP.
