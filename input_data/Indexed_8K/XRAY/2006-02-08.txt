Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On February 8, 2006, the Company issued a press release disclosing its fourth quarter and full year 2005 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content and earnings from continuing operations excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations excluding certain unusual items is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01.

NEWS For Further Information Contact: William R. Jellison FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (717) 849-4243 DENTSPLY International Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2005 Sales and Earnings York, PA - February 8, 2006 -- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ-XRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005. Sales in 2005 increased 1.2% to $1.72 billion compared to $1.69 billion reported for 2004. Sales excluding precious metals, increased 4.2% in 2005. Internal growth, of sales excluding precious metals, (excluding currency translation and acquisitions) was 2.0% for the full year. The impact of the German dental reform on internal growth is estimated to be a negative 4% for the year. Net income from continuing operations for 2005 was $45.4 million or $0.56 per diluted share. The 2005 earnings included the following items: 1) Pretax impairment and restructuring charges primarily associated with the injectable anesthetic facility and indefinite-lived intangible assets, of $232.8 million ($178.9 million after-tax) or $2.21 per diluted share. 2) Net non-recurring benefits related to tax reorganization and repatriation activities of $8.9 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Net income from continuing operations for 2004 was $210.3 million or $2.56 per diluted share. The 2004 period includes: 1) Pretax charges of $7.1 million or $0.06 per diluted share relating to restructuring activities. 2) A net income tax benefit of $19.5 million or $0.24 per diluted share primarily related to adjustments and settling audits of tax returns. Earnings from continuing operations for comparability analysis, excluding the items noted above for the years ending 2005 and 2004, which constitutes a non-GAAP measure, were $215.4 million or $2.66 per diluted share for 2005 compared to $2.38 in 2004, an increase of 11.8%.
Sales in the fourth quarter 2005 decreased 3.9% to $447.4 million compared to $465.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2004. Sales excluding precious metals, decreased 1.1% to $400.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The sales growth rate was negatively impacted in the quarter due to stronger pre-reform purchasing levels by dental professionals within Germany in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales were also negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 2005 due to the implementation of price increases earlier in the year, and a negative impact from currency translation, as the U.S. dollar was stronger in the quarter compared to the same period last year against most foreign currencies. Net loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $0.7 million or $0.01 per diluted share, a decrease compared to net income from continuing operations of $69.0 million or $0.83 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2004. The fourth quarter of 2005 included a pretax impairment and restructuring charge of $101.4 million ($67.5 million after-tax) or $0.86 per diluted share, primarily associated with the injectable anesthetic facility and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This charge reflects the Company's decision to permanently close its Chicago-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturing facility and to seek strategic alternatives for the facility and for the dental injectable product supply. The quarter also included a net income tax benefit from a global tax project and the repatriation of foreign earnings of $5.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share. The fourth quarter of 2004 included pretax charges of $4.0 million or $0.03 per diluted share relating to restructuring activities for the creation of the European Shared Service Center and Sales/Customer Service consolidations in Europe and Japan. The quarter also included a reduction of income taxes of $15.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share related to adjustments in the Company's tax contingencies from settling audits of domestic and foreign tax returns and adjustments associated with prior periods. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding the items noted above for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, which constitutes a non-GAAP measure, would have been $61.1 million or $0.76 per diluted share for 2005 compared to $56.0 million or $0.68 in 2004, an increase of 11.8% on a diluted per share basis. Gary K. Kunkle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented that, "DENTSPLY was faced with two significant challenges in 2005, the soft German market (impacted by the reimbursement changes implemented by their government) and the increased costs associated with our pharmaceutical facility. We are pleased however, with the underlying profit improvements in our business and our strong year-end cash flow. We look forward to 2006 with the promise of moving both these issues behind us and the expectation of solid improvements, and new product introductions in many of our businesses." Earnings Guidance for 2006 The Company expects earnings in 2006 to be $2.80 to $2.85 per diluted share, excluding any restructuring costs. This includes approximately $.15 per diluted share of costs associated with the expensing of stock options due to the adoption of stock-based compensation following the mandatory adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") 123(R) Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. On a non-GAAP basis excluding the after-tax impact of expensing of stock-based compensation and restructuring costs, diluted earnings per share are expected to be $2.95 to $3.00.
