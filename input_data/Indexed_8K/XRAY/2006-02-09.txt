Item 1.01. - Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 1.01. On February 3, 2006, the Human Resources Committee (the "HR Committee") of the Board of Directors of Dentsply International Inc. (the "Company") adopted the Dentsply International Inc. Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The HR Committee also established certain financial criteria and targets for 2006 in accordance with the Plan. For the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the targets are based on the budgeted level of corporate net income, adjusted for sales growth, achieved in 2006. For each of the other Senior Vice Presidents in charge of operating groups, the targets are based on the budgeted level of corporate net income, adjusted for sales growth, and on the budgeted operating income level, adjusted for sales growth, of the applicable business group for which such executive is responsible.

The applicable percentage for the Chief Operating Officer is 75%, and for the Chief Financial Officer and other Senior Vice Presidents in charge of operating groups, the applicable percentage is 55%.
