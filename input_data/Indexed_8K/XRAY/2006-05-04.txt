Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On May 3, 2006, the Company issued a press release disclosing its first quarter 2006 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content and net income excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations excluding certain unusual items is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01.

First Quarter 2006 earnings release issued May 3, 2006 as referenced in Item 2.02.

NEWS For Further Information Contact: William R. Jellison FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (717) 849-4243 DENTSPLY International Inc. Reports First Quarter 2006 Sales and Earnings York, PA - May 3, 2006 -- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ-XRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Net sales increased 5.9% to $431.0 million compared to $407.0 million reported for the first quarter of 2005. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 3.9% in the first quarter of 2006, compared to 2005. Sales, in the first quarter of 2006, were positively affected by stronger European internal growth, but negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the same period last year. Net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $50.0 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, an increase of 3.3% compared to income of $49.0 million, or $0.60 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005. Net income in the first quarter of 2006 included the net of tax impact of both expensing stock options of $3.2 million, ($0.04 per diluted share), and of restructuring costs of $3.1 million ($0.04 per diluted share). On a pro forma basis, earnings, excluding restructuring costs but including the expensing of stock options in both periods, which constitutes a non-GAAP measure, were $53.1 million or $0.66 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $46.4 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005. This is a 17.9% increase in diluted earnings per share. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP, see the attached table. Gary Kunkle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented "We are pleased to see an improvement in the German market, during the first quarter. While we do not expect 2006 will return to 2004 levels in Germany, we do expect our European growth to benefit from improvements in this important region throughout most of 2006." Mr. Kunkle also stated, "We are also experiencing continued strong performance in the all ceramic section of our prosthetics business, orthodontics and our implant businesses, as we continue to gain market share in these important categories. These positive trends along with other initiatives give us confidence in maintaining our earnings guidance of $2.80 - $2.85 per diluted share for 2006, including the expensing of stock options, but excluding restructuring charges."
