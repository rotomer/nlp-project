Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On July 26, 2006, the Company issued a press release disclosing its second quarter 2006 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content and net income excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations excluding certain unusual items is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01.

Second Quarter 2006 earnings release issued July 26, 2006 as referenced in Item 2.02.

NEWS For Further Information Contact: William R. Jellison FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (717) 849-4243 DENTSPLY International Inc. Reports Record Second Quarter 2006 Sales and Earnings York, PA - July 26, 2006 -- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ-XRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Net sales increased 6.2% to $472.4 million compared to $444.8 million reported for the second quarter of 2005. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 5.8% in the second quarter of 2006. Sales growth improved in the U.S. and also within the broader consumable products category. Net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $59.3 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, an increase of 5.7% in diluted earnings per share compared to net income of $57.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2005. Net income in the second quarter of 2006 includes the net of tax impact of both expensing stock options of $2.9 million, ($0.02 per diluted share), and of restructuring costs of $1.6 million, ($0.01 per diluted share). The second quarter of 2006 includes a net charge to income tax expense of $0.8 million ($0.01 per diluted share) from tax related adjustments, while the second quarter of 2005 included a net reduction of income tax expense of $1.8 million ($0.01 per diluted share) related to the settlement of audits of tax returns associated with prior periods. All share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the stock split. On an adjusted basis, earnings, excluding restructuring costs and tax adjustments, but including the expensing of stock options in both periods, which constitutes a non-GAAP measure, were $61.7 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006, compared to $53.1 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2005. This represents an 18.2% increase in diluted earnings per share. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP, see the attached table. Gary Kunkle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented that, "We are very pleased with the continued strength of our global business. DENTSPLY's breadth and depth of products, combined with our global footprint provide further opportunities to build and strengthen our business. Improvements in our operational performance provide us with the ability to further strengthen sales, marketing, and research and development activities." Mr. Kunkle also stated, "Our solid performance, in the first half of the year, provides us additional confidence in the prospects for the full year. We expect to increase our internal investment in growth initiatives over the next few quarters; however we are also increasing the top-end of our year-end 2006 earnings guidance to $1.40-1.44 per dilutive share, including the expensing of stock options, but excluding restructuring charges and tax adjustments."
