Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On November 1, 2006, the Company issued a press release disclosing its third quarter 2006 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content and net income excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations excluding certain unusual items is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01.

Third Quarter 2006 earnings release issued November 1, 2006 as referenced in Item 2.02.

NEWS For Further Information Contact: William R. Jellison FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (717) 849-4243 DENTSPLY International Inc. Reports Record Third Quarter 2006 Sales and Earnings York, PA - November 1, 2006 -- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ-XRAY) today announced record sales and earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. Net sales increased 4.8% to $435.7 million compared to $416.0 million reported for the third quarter of 2005. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 5.8% in the third quarter of 2006. U.S. dealer-based purchases ahead of price increases, along with continued strength in specialty products, benefited performance for the quarter. This was partially offset by product returns from approximately 200 distributors that were discontinued as part of our previously announced Strategic Partnership Program during the period. Net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $49.4 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $60.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005. Net income in the third quarter of 2006 includes the net of tax impact of both expensing stock options of $3.6 million ($0.02 per diluted share) and of restructuring and other related items of $0.6 million. The third quarter of 2006 includes a net charge to income tax expense of $3.4 million ($0.02 per diluted share) from tax-related adjustments, while the third quarter of 2005 included a net of tax impact of $111.6 million ($0.71 per diluted share) for impairment of intangible assets associated with injectable anesthetic products and a net reduction of income tax expense of $1.1 million ($0.01 per diluted share) related to tax related adjustments. On an adjusted basis, earnings, excluding restructuring and other related items and tax adjustments, but including the expensing of stock options in both periods, which constitutes a non-GAAP measure, were $52.2 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $46.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005. This represents a 10.0% increase in diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP, see the attached table. Gary Kunkle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented that, "We are pleased with the progress we are making on the important growth initiatives that we have implemented as we position the Company for continued growth in the future. During the quarter, we announced our Strategic Partnership Program in the U.S. This action will significantly enhance our customer specific intelligence and allow us to better focus selling and marketing activities on the dental professional, our end-user customer. Also during the quarter, we increased our focus on dental implant sales by combining the implant and endodontic sales organizations in the U.S. This better positions DENTSPLY to take further advantage of the continued rapid growth of the dental implant market." Mr. Kunkle also stated, "We believe these actions will strengthen our long-term position within the dental industry and provide us with the ability to deliver solid performance in 2007. We are maintaining our previous earnings guidance for 2006 of $1.38-1.42, including the expensing of stock options, but excluding tax adjustments, and restructuring and other related items." DENTSPLY has reviewed its prior accounting related to the classification of certain short-term investments. Based on this review, the Company has determined that the classification of these short-term investments should be revised from their prior presentation as cash equivalents. The Company plans to reclassify its short-term investments and restate the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and its Form 10Qs for the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006 to reflect the required change. This restatement has no impact on net sales, net income, earnings per share, current assets, total assets, stockholders' equity, or cash flows from operating activities.
