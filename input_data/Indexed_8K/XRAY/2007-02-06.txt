Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On February 6,2007, the Company issued a press release disclosing its fourth quarter and full year 2006 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content and net income excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations excluding certain unusual items is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits (a) Financial Statements - Not applicable. (b) Exhibits: 99.1 The Dentsply International Inc. fourth quarter and full year 2006 earnings release issued February 6, 2007 as referenced in Item 2.02.

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales of specialty products, including implants and orthodontic products along with the Company's all-ceramic Cercon products all enjoyed double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Consistent with the Company's statements in September and October, sales decreased in the United States reflecting the short-term effects of the implementation of the U.S. Strategic Partnership Program.

Net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 includes the net of tax impact of both expensing stock options of $3.6 million ($0.02 per diluted share) and of restructuring and other related items of $1.0 million ($0.01 per diluted share). The fourth quarter of 2006 also includes a net reduction to income tax expense of $8.8 million ($0.06 per diluted share) from the resolution of certain tax matters. The fourth quarter of 2005 included an after tax charge of $67.5 million ($0.42 per diluted share) for impairment of certain intangible assets and a net reduction of income tax expense of $5.7 million ($0.04 per diluted share) related to the resolution of certain tax matters.
 
On an adjusted basis, earnings, excluding restructuring and other related items and tax adjustments, but including the expensing of stock options in both periods, which constitutes a non-GAAP measure, were $57.1 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $55.7 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005.

COMMENTS FROM MANAGEMENT
 
2006 Results & 2007 Outlook
 
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented that, "We are pleased that we have delivered earnings performance at the high end of our range of expectations for 2006. During the year, we have made strategic investments in several key initiatives, including implementation of our Strategic Partnership with our U.S. distributors, the expansion of our sales force in key markets, and the January 1, 2007 implementation of the merger of our U.S. endodontic and implant businesses. We believe these initiatives will generate substantial benefits in 2007, and beyond. We remain confident about the opportunities in 2007, and we anticipate earnings in the range of $1.56 to $1.61 per diluted share."
