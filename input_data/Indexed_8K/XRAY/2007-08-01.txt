Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On July 31, 2007, the Company issued a press release disclosing its second quarter 2007 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales excluding precious metal content and net income excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations excluding certain unusual items is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits (a) Financial Statements - Not applicable. (b) Exhibits: 99.1 The Dentsply International Inc. Second Quarter 2007 earnings release issued July 31, 2007 as referenced in Item 2.02.

Net income in the second quarter of 2007 included the net of tax impact of restructuring and other costs of $2.0 million ($0.01 per diluted share), also included in the quarter was a net charge for income tax-related adjustments of $0.6 million ($0.01 per diluted share). The second quarter of 2006 included the net of tax impact of restructuring costs of $1.6 million ($0.01 per diluted share), and also included a net charge to income tax expense of $0.8 million ($0.01 per diluted share).
 
 
Earnings, excluding restructuring and other costs, and income tax-related adjustments, which constitute a non-GAAP measure, were $68.0 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $61.7 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006.

COMMENTS FROM MANAGEMENT
 
2007 Second Quarter Results & 2007 Full Year Outlook
 
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated "The investments that we are making and the excitement surrounding our new products, within the market place, continue to create opportunities for our businesses. We are especially pleased with the performance of our specialty products businesses, where we are experiencing strong double digit internal growth rates in implants, endodontics and orthodontics."
 
Mr. Wise also commented that, "During the quarter we continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives. Late in the quarter we completed three small acquisitions in diagnostics, implant sales and marketing, and endodontic materials. In addition, early in the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of Sultan Healthcare, which provide an entrance into the important and growing field of infection control, as well as expanding our product mix in preventive and restorative dental products."
 
Mr. Wise went on to state, "The continued momentum we see across our business strengthens our confidence in delivering strong and improved results in 2007. We are increasing our full year internal sales growth guidance for 2007 to 6-7%, and also increasing our earnings guidance from $1.56 - $1.61 given at the beginning of the year to $1.60 - $1.64 per diluted share, excluding income tax-related adjustments and restructuring and other costs."
