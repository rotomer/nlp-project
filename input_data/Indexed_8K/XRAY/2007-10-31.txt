Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On October 31, 2007, the Company issued a press release disclosing its third quarter 2007 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.

DENTSPLY International Inc.
Reports Record Third Quarter 2007 Sales and Earnings
 
 
York, PA  October 31, 2007 -- DENTSPLY International Inc.
(NASDAQXRAY) today announced record sales and earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2007.
 
FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2007
 
Net sales in the third quarter of 2007 increased 12.0% to $488.1 million compared to $435.7 million reported for the third quarter of 2006. Net sales, without precious metal content, increased 12.8% to $445.3 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared to $394.8 million in the same period in 2006. Net sales without precious metal content, in the third quarter of 2007, reflects strong international sales, recent acquisitions, and the strength of international currencies, especially the Euro and the Swiss Franc. Sales of specialty products, including implants, endodontic, and orthodontic products, all enjoyed double-digit internal growth in the period.
 
Net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $65.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, an increase of 35.5% compared to $0.31 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006. Net income in the third quarter of 2007 was reduced by restructuring and other costs, net of tax, of $3.0 million ($0.02 per diluted share), and was increased by net income tax adjustments of $7.8 million ($0.05 per diluted share). The third quarter of 2006 was increased by restructuring benefits net of tax, of $0.6 million, and was reduced by income tax adjustments of $3.4 million ($0.02 per diluted share).
 
 
 
Earnings on a non-GAAP basis, (excluding restructuring and other costs, and income tax-related adjustments), were $61.0 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $52.2 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006. This represents an 18.2% increase in earnings per diluted share on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. For a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, see the attached table.
 
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated We are pleased with our results in 2007 and believe that our broad product mix, focused on an attractive global dental market, positions us well for the future. We are seeing strength across many of our businesses, particularly in our international operations and our specialty businesses, including implants, orthodontics and endodontics. Our overall growth profile is also beginning to benefit from increased acquisition activity and strategic reinvestment of our strong cash flow generation.
 
Mr. Wise also commented that, Given the results year-to-date, we are pleased to once again increase our earnings guidance for the full year 2007 to $1.62 - $1.66, from our previous guidance of $1.60 - $1.64 per diluted share, excluding income tax-related adjustments, and restructuring and other costs.
