Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On February 5, 2008, the Company issued a press release disclosing its fourth quarter and full year 2007 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Annual Sales Cross $2 Billion Milestone

FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2007
 
Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 14.9% to $541.5 million compared to $471.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 16.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales of specialty products, including implants, endodontics, and orthodontic products enjoyed double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth reflects the impact of improved organic growth, the benefit of acquisitions completed in 2007, and additional exchange impact associated with the weaker US dollar.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $70.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $64.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 includes charges, net of tax, for restructuring and other related items of $1.0 million, ($0.01) per diluted share. The fourth quarter of 2007 also includes a net reduction to income tax expense of $2.5 million, $0.02 per diluted share, from the resolution of certain tax matters. The fourth quarter of 2006 included charges, net of tax, for restructuring and other related items of $1.0 million, ($0.01) per diluted share, and a net reduction of income tax expense of $8.8 million, $0.06 per diluted share, related to the resolution of certain tax matters
 
On an adjusted basis, earnings, excluding restructuring and other related items and tax adjustments, which constitute a non-GAAP measure, were $68.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $57.1 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 18.9% in earnings per diluted share. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP, see the attached table.
 
 
 
 
Year Ended December 31, 2007

Net income for 2007 was $259.7 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared to $223.7 million or $1.41 per diluted share in 2006. This represents a 19.1% increase in diluted earnings per share.

For comparability analysis, net income, excluding restructuring and other related items and tax adjustments for the years ending 2007 and 2006 (a non-GAAP measure), was $256.4 million or $1.66 per diluted share for 2007, compared to $224.0 million or $1.42 per diluted share in 2006, an increase of 16.9% in diluted earnings per share.

2007 Results & 2008 Outlook
 
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased with the acceleration of our sales growth and earnings performance in 2007, as many of the strategic initiatives implemented in 2006 and 2007 began to contribute to results. During the year, we achieved an important milestone with sales exceeding $2 billion for the first time, just six years after first reaching $1 billion in sales. Our broad product portfolio, focus on consumables, and global footprint position us well for future success. Despite the volatility in the broader global markets, we remain confident in our ability to grow and experience another year of solid performance in 2008. For full year 2008, we believe that internal sales growth will range from 5.5% - 6.5% and total sales growth should approach or exceed 10% as we continue to benefit from acquisitions and current foreign exchange rates. We also anticipate earnings for 2008 to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.88 per diluted share.
