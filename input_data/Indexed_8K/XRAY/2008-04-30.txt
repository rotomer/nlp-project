Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On April 30, 2008, the Company issued a press release disclosing its first quarter 2008 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Reports Record 2008 First Quarter Sales and Earnings
 
Sales increase 18.6%
Earnings per diluted share increase 18.4%
 
 
York, PA  April 30, 2008 -- DENTSPLY International Inc.
(NASDAQXRAY) today announced record sales and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2008. Net sales in the first quarter of 2008 increased 18.6% to $560.8 million compared to $472.9 million reported for the first quarter of 2007. Net sales, without precious metal content, were $496.2 million, a 17.2% increase compared to 2007. Net sales, in the first quarter of 2008, were positively affected by strong internal growth, acquisitions, and from the strength of international currencies against the U.S. dollar.
 
Net income for the first quarter of 2008 was $68.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, an increase of 18.4% compared $0.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007. No meaningful adjustments on a non-GAAP basis occurred in either quarterly period. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP, see the attached table.
 
COMMENTS FROM MANAGEMENT
 
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased to report a strong start to 2008, reflecting the benefits of both our broad product portfolio and geographic platform, as well as continued execution against our strategic initiatives. The long-term prospects for growth, in the global dental market, remain attractive and we are accelerating investment in several areas, despite softer economic conditions in the United States. Our first quarter sales and earnings performance provide us with increased confidence in our full year 2008 guidance of 5.5%-6.5% internal growth and earnings per diluted share of $1.83 to $1.88.
