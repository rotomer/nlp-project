Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On July 30, 2008, the Company issued a press release disclosing its second quarter 2008 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Reports Record Second Quarter 2008 Sales and Earnings
 
  Sales Increase 17.2%
 
 
York, PA  July 29, 2008 -- DENTSPLY International Inc.
(NASDAQXRAY) today announced record sales and earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2008.
 
FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
Three Months Ended June 30, 2008
 
Net sales in the second quarter of 2008 increased 17.2% to $594.8 million compared to $507.4 million reported for the second quarter of 2007. Net sales, without precious metal content, increased 17.3% to $542.3 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $462.1 million in 2007, reflecting strong growth in international markets, the strength of international currencies and the benefit of acquisitions completed in 2007. Each of the four business segments experienced double digit total sales growth in the quarter.
 
Net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $78.6 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, an increase of 23.8% compared to $0.42 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007. Net income in the second quarter of 2008 included a net of tax interest benefit resulting from the provisions of SFAS 157 "Fair Value Measurements" of $1.1 million, the net of tax impact of restructuring and other costs of $0.9 million, and a net charge for income tax-related adjustments of $1.0 million, which in aggregate reduced earnings per share on a net basis by less than $0.01 per diluted share. The second quarter of 2007 included the net of tax impact of restructuring costs of $2.0 million and a net charge to income tax expense of $0.6 million, which in the aggregate reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.02.
 
Net Income on a non-GAAP basis, (excluding an interest benefit from the provisions of SFAS 157, restructuring and other costs, and income tax-related adjustments), was $79.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008 compared to $68.0 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007. This represents an 18.2% increase in earnings per diluted share on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. For a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, see the attached table.
 
2008 Second Quarter Results & 2008 Full Year Outlook
 
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated We are pleased that the strength of our diversified dental consumable portfolio and our broad global platform have once again allowed us to deliver record sales and earnings performance.  Our businesses are growing rapidly in many international markets allowing us to make expanded investments in research and development, as well as in sales force expansion in markets with high growth potential."
 
Mr. Wise went on to state, Our strong year-to-date performance, new product launches, and current business and market assessment provide us with increased confidence in our earnings growth for 2008. We are increasing our full year guidance from the $1.83 - $1.88 earnings per diluted share, provided earlier in the year, to $1.86 - $1.91 per diluted share for the full year 2008."  Guidance for 2008 excludes income tax related adjustments, restructuring and other costs, and the benefit from the provisions of SFAS 157.
