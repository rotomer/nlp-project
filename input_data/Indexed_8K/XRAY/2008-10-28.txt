Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On October 29, 2008, the Company issued a press release disclosing its third quarter 2008 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Reports Record Third Quarter 2008 Sales and Earnings
 
York, PA  October 28, 2008 -- DENTSPLY International Inc.
(NASDAQXRAY) today announced record sales and earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2008.
 
FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2008
 
Net sales in the third quarter of 2008 increased 8.6% to $530.0 million compared to $488.1 million reported for the third quarter of 2007. Net sales, without precious metal content, increased 9.6% to $488.1 million in the third quarter of 2008, as we continued to benefit from a balanced portfolio of dental products with a diversified geographic mix, favorable exchange impact and acquisition growth.
 
Net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $66.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $0.42 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2007. Net income in the third quarter of 2008 included an $11.4 million net of tax charge for restructuring and other costs, and a net benefit for income tax-related adjustments of $8.2 million, which combined, reduced earnings per share on a net basis by $.02 per diluted share. The third quarter of 2007 included the net of tax impact of restructuring and other costs of $3.0 million and a net benefit for income tax-related adjustments of $7.8 million, which combined, benefited earnings per diluted share by $.03.
 
Net income on a non-GAAP basis, (excluding restructuring and other costs, and income tax-related adjustments), was $69.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008 compared to $61.0 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2007. This represents a 17.9% increase in
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                             
 
 
 
earnings per diluted share on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. For a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, see the attached table.
 
2008 Third Quarter Results & 2008 Full Year Outlook
 
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated We are very pleased to once again deliver record top and bottom line results in the third quarter. We continue to benefit from our role as a key diversified player in the global dental industry, which generally has less volatility than broader markets. We believe our global market position and financial strength in todays economic environment will allow us to develop a stronger presence in the worldwide dental market as we move forward.
 
Mr. Wise went on to state, While we acknowledge that economic volatility is making global markets more unpredictable, our strong and consistent year-to-date performance, new product launches, and current assessment of business and market conditions continue to give us confidence in our business model. We are reconfirming our 2008 guidance of $1.86 to $1.91 for earnings per diluted share. Guidance for 2008 excludes income tax related adjustments, restructuring and other costs, and the benefit from the provisions of SFAS 157.
