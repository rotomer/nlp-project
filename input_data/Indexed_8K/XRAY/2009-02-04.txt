Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On February 4, 2009, the Company issued a press release disclosing its fourth quarter and full year 2008 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.

DENTSPLY INTERNATIONAL INC.
REPORTS FULL YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
 
 
(NASDAQXRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the three months and year ended December 31, 2008.
York, PA February 4, 2009 -- DENTSPLY International Inc.
 
FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
Year Ended December 31, 2008
 
Net sales for the full 2008 year increased 9.1% to $2,193.7 million compared to $2,009.8 million in 2007. Sales, excluding precious metals, increased 9.6% for the year. The increase in sales for the year primarily resulted from strong growth in the specialty product areas of endodontics, implants and orthodontics. Acquisitions and favorable foreign exchange impacts also benefited sales growth for the full year.
 
Net income for 2008 was $283.9 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, compared to $259.7 million or $1.68 per diluted share in 2007. This represents an 11.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. Net income for the full-year of 2008 included charges, net of tax, for restructuring and other related items of $19.8 million, or ($0.13) per diluted share. Net Income also included a net reduction to income tax expense of $17.1 million, $0.11 per diluted share, related to the resolution of certain tax matters and a $1.1 million or $0.01 per diluted share, interest benefit, net of tax from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting No. 157 (SFAS 157). The net income in 2007 included charges, net of tax, for restructuring and other related items of $6.7 million, ($0.04) per diluted share, and a net reduction of income tax expense of $9.9 million, $0.06 per diluted share, related to the resolution of certain tax matters.
 
 
                                                                                                                                    
 
 
 
For comparability analysis, net income, excluding restructuring and other related items, tax adjustments and the benefits of the adoption of SFAS 157 for the years ending 2008 and 2007 (a non-GAAP measure), was $285.5 million or $1.88 per diluted share for 2008, compared to $256.4 million or $1.66 per diluted share in 2007, an increase of 13.3% in diluted earnings per share. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share on a GAAP basis is provided in the attached table.
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2008
 
Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 6.2% to $508.1 million compared to $541.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The lower sales levels were impacted by the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter, as well as slowing of dental demand in certain regions as underlying economic activity declined. Sales of specialty products, including implants, endodontics, and orthodontic products continued to experience positive growth in the quarter, however slowed from double-digit sales growth earlier in the year.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $71.0 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to net income of $70.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 includes charges, net of tax, for restructuring and other related items of $7.3 million, or ($0.05) per diluted share. The fourth quarter of 2008 also includes a net reduction to income tax expense of $10.5 million, $0.07 per diluted share, from the resolution of certain tax matters. The fourth quarter of 2007 included charges, net of tax, for restructuring and other related items of $1.0 million, ($0.01) per diluted share, and a net reduction of income tax expense of $2.5 million, $0.02 per diluted share, related to the resolution of certain tax matters.
 
On an adjusted basis, earnings, excluding restructuring and other related items and tax adjustments, which constitutes a non-GAAP measure, were $67.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $68.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 2.3% in earnings per diluted share. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share on a GAAP basis, see the attached table.
 
2008 Results & 2009 Outlook
 
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to have delivered strong growth in both sales and earnings in 2008, despite the challenges presented by the world economy in the fourth quarter. DENTSPLY is well positioned, with continued strong cash flows and a favorable liquidity position, to prosper throughout economic cycles. We continue to focus on investing in growth opportunities in the global dental market and are taking steps to ensure flexibility in our operating model as we move into 2009. As a result, we expect that earnings per diluted share will range from $1.85 to $1.95 for the full year 2009.
 
Guidance for 2009 excludes restructuring and other costs, the reversal of the inventory step-up charge from our recent acquisitions and income tax related adjustments.
