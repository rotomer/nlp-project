Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On April 30, 2009, the Company issued a press release disclosing its first quarter 2009 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, net income, excluding certain unusual items, and an effective tax rate, excluding certain unusual items, all of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, and the effective tax rate, excluding certain unusual items are presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Reports 2009 First Quarter Results
 
(NASDAQXRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Net sales in the first quarter of 2009 decreased 9.6% to $506.9 million compared to $560.8 million reported for the first quarter of 2008. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were $465.7 million, a 6.2% decrease compared to 2008. The change in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was driven by currency translation, which reduced sales by 6.9%, offset by 0.7% growth on a constant currency basis which includes acquisitions.
York, PA  April 30, 2009 -- DENTSPLY International Inc.
 
DENTSPLYs net income for the first quarter of 2009 was $61.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $0.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008. Net income in the first quarter of 2009 included the net of tax impact of restructuring, impairment and other costs of $1.0 million, a $1.1 million net of tax impact for recent acquisition-related activities and a net charge for income tax-related adjustments of $0.3 million. These items, in aggregate, reduced earnings on a net basis by $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2008 included the net of tax impact of restructuring costs of $0.1 million and a net charge to income tax expense of $0.6 million, which in the aggregate, reduced earnings per diluted share by less than $0.01. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP, see the attached table.
 
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased to be able to deliver what we believe are solid results in a slowing global economy and dental market. In this environment, we are striking a balance between cost containment and continuing investment in technologies and marketing that will position us for growth in coming years. We achieved sales growth, excluding precious metal content, on a constant currency basis in the first quarter and solid profitability, despite the significant headwind from the economy. Our global diversification, depth of product lines and the strength of our balance sheet provide a solid foundation to further build upon our market position throughout economic cycles. Given current global economic conditions, we are slightly modifying our full year 2009 earnings per diluted share guidance to $1.80 to $1.90 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other costs, recent acquisition-related activities and income tax-related adjustments.

This press release contains forward-looking information (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those in the projections or other forward-looking information set forth herein as a result of certain risk factors.
 
These risk factors include, without limitation; the continued strength of dental markets, the timing, success and market reception for our new and existing products, uncertainty with respect to governmental actions with respect to dental products, outcome of litigation, continued support of our products by influential dental professionals, and changes in the general economic environment that could affect our business.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the Company provided adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share.  These adjusted amounts consist of GAAP amounts excluding (1) restructuring and other costs, (2) acquisition-related charges and (3) income tax-related adjustments.  Adjusted earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.  The Company also provided an operational tax rate, which is the Companys effective tax rate, a GAAP measure, adjusted for certain one-time charges.  Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate are considered measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and therefore are non-GAAP measures.  These non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies.
 
The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  The non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
