Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On October 28, 2009, the Company issued a press release disclosing its third quarter 2009 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Reports Third Quarter 2009 Sales and Earnings
 
DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQXRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2009. Net sales in the third quarter of 2009 increased 0.2% to $531.0 million compared to $530.0 million reported for the third quarter of 2008. Net sales, without precious metal content, increased 1.1% to $493.6 million in the third quarter of 2009. The change in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was driven by an increase of 2.5% in constant currency including acquisitions, partially offset by currency translation, which reduced sales by 1.4% in the period.   Net income for the third quarter of 2009 was $67.5 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $0.44 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008. Net income in the third quarter of 2009 included the net of tax impact of restructuring and other costs of $0.8 million, a net of tax impact for recent acquisition-related activities of $0.1 million and a net benefit for income tax-related adjustments of $2.6 million, which in aggregate increased earnings per share on a net basis by $0.01 per diluted share. The third quarter of 2008 included an $11.4 million net of tax charge for restructuring and other costs, and a net benefit for income tax-related adjustments of $8.2 million, which combined, reduced earnings per share on a net basis by $0.02 per diluted share. For a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, see the attached table.   We are pleased to report solid sales and earnings performance for the quarter, as well as excellent cash flow generation, despite the continuing macroeconomic challenges impacting the global dental market said Bret W. Wise, Chairman and CEO. The global dental market appears to be in the early stages of a recovery, although it is likely to be gradual and vary across geographic regions and product categories. Given the current market conditions, we are tightening the range of our full year earnings guidance to $1.81 to $1.86 per diluted share, measured on a non-GAAP basis.

This press release contains forward-looking information (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those in the projections or other forward-looking information set forth herein as a result of certain risk factors. These risk factors include, without limitation; the continued strength of dental markets, the timing, success and market reception for our new and existing products, uncertainty with respect to governmental actions with respect to dental products, outcome of litigation, continued support of our products by influential dental professionals, and changes in the general economic environment that could affect our business. Changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results. For an additional description of risk factors, please refer to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K and its subsequent periodic reports on Forms 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the Company provided adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share.  These adjusted amounts consist of GAAP amounts excluding (1) restructuring and other costs, (2) acquisition-related charges and (3) income tax-related adjustments.  Adjusted earnings per diluted share are calculated by dividing adjusted net income by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.  The Company also provided an operational tax rate, which is the Companys effective tax rate, a GAAP measure, adjusted for certain one-time charges.  Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate are considered measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and therefore are non-GAAP measures.  These non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies.
 
The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  The non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
