Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
   The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
   On April 29, 2010, the Company issued a press release disclosing its first quarter 2010 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods.  Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.

(NASDAQXRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2010.  Net sales in the first quarter of 2010 increased 7.7% to $545.9 million compared to $506.9 million reported for the first quarter of 2009.  Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were $497.5 million, a 6.8% increase compared to the first quarter of 2009. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were favorably impacted by strengthening internal growth, the benefit of a weaker U.S. dollar in the period, and acquisitions. Net sales of dental consumable products and dental specialty products continued to generate positive internal growth in the period.
York, PA  April 29, 2010  DENTSPLY International Inc.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the first quarter of 2010 was $61.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $0.41 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009.  Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the first quarter of 2010 included the net of tax impact of restructuring and other costs of $2.8 million, a $0.4 million net of tax impact for acquisition-related activities and a net charge for income tax-related adjustments of $0.4 million.  Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the first quarter of 2009 included the net of tax impact of restructuring and other costs of $1.0 million, a $1.1 million net of tax impact for acquisition-related activities and a net charge for income tax-related adjustments of $0.3 million.  These items, in aggregate, reduced earnings on a net basis by $0.03 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 and $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009.   For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP, see the attached table.
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated We are beginning to see the early signs of growth returning to the dental markets in several geographies and product categories, and are also continuing to see momentum in a number of our businesses beyond market growth.  We are encouraged by the early results from the investments we made late last year in incremental sales and marketing resources, and continue to enjoy a robust pipeline of new product innovations.   These factors give us continued confidence in our full year 2010 earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.00.  This guidance for earnings per diluted share is on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other costs, acquisition-related activities and income tax-related adjustments.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the Company provided adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International and adjusted earnings per diluted share.  These adjusted amounts consist of GAAP amounts excluding (1) restructuring and other costs, (2) acquisition-related charges, (3) adoption of certain new accounting standards, and (4) income tax-related adjustments.  Adjusted earnings per diluted share are calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.  The Company also provided an operational tax rate, which is the Companys effective tax rate, a GAAP measure, adjusted for certain one-time charges.  Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate are considered measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and therefore are non-GAAP measures.  These non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies.
The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  The non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
