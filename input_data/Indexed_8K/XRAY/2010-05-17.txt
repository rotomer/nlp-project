The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 5.02(e), Compensation Arrangements of Certain Officers.
The DENTSPLY International Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan was approved on May 11, 2010 at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  The Company maintains the Plan under which it may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSU) and stock appreciation rights, collectively referred to as Awards to employees, including executive officers.  The Plan allows the Company to authorize grants of 13.0 million shares of common stock, plus any unexercised portion of cancelled or terminated stock options granted under the DENTSPLY International Inc. 2002 Plan, subject to adjustment as follows:  each January, if 7% of the total outstanding common shares of the Company exceed 13.0 million, the excess becomes available for grant under the Plan.
 
Options with respect to no more than one million (1,000,000) shares of Common Stock may be granted as ISOs under the Plan, (ii) no more than two million five hundred thousand (2,500,000) shares may be awarded as Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units under the Plan, and (iii) in any calendar year no Key Employee shall be granted Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to more than five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of Common Stock, or Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units in excess of 150,000 shares of Common Stock. Any shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights which expire, terminate or are cancelled, and any shares of Common Stock subject to any grant of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units which are forfeited, may again be subject to new Awards under the Plan.
 
Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Plan, the Plan shall automatically terminate on March 24, 2020.  A termination of the Plan shall not affect Awards previously granted under the Plan.
