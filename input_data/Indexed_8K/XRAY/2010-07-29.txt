Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On July 29, 2010, the Company issued a press release disclosing its second quarter 2010 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which could be considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods.  Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit (99.1) and is hereby incorporated by reference.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer
(717) 849-4243
(NASDAQXRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2010.  Net sales in the second quarter of 2010 increased 2.2% to $565.1 million compared to $552.8 million reported for the second quarter of 2009.  Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 1.5% to $519.3 million in the second quarter of 2010 and were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
York, PA  July 29, 2010 -- DENTSPLY International Inc.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the second quarter of 2010 was $72.4 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $0.47 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.  Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the second quarter of 2010 included the net of tax impact of restructuring and other costs of $0.2 million, an incremental net of tax interest charge of $0.7 million resulting from a credit risk adjustment to outstanding derivatives, and a net charge for income tax-related adjustments of $0.6 million, which in aggregate reduced earnings per share on a net basis by $.01 per diluted share.  Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the second quarter of 2009 included the net of tax impact of restructuring and other costs of $2.2 million, a net of tax impact for acquisition-related activities of $0.5 million and a net charge for income tax-related adjustments of $0.2 million, which in aggregate reduced earnings per share on a net basis by $.02 per diluted share.  For a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, see the attached table.
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated The dental markets have shown a modest recovery in the first half of 2010.  In this environment, we are pleased that our performance has also gradually improved, allowing us to generate positive internal sales growth through the first half of the year.  We continue to make investments in the business that we believe will accelerate our performance as the dental markets recover.  Consistent with the trends established late last year, we are generating positive earnings growth and strong cash flows, despite the negative effects of the stronger U.S. dollar compared to many currencies.  We expect these positive performance trends will continue for the remainder of 2010, although currency exchange rates are also expected to have negative effects on reported results.  Based on current exchange rates, we are adjusting our full year earnings expectations to $1.86 to $1.94 per diluted share.   This guidance for earnings per diluted share is on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other costs, acquisition-related activities and income tax-related adjustments.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the Company provided adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to
DENTSPLY International and adjusted earnings per diluted share.  These adjusted amounts consist of GAAP amounts excluding (1) restructuring and other costs, (2) acquisition-related charges and (3) income tax-related adjustments.  Adjusted earnings per diluted share are calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.  The Company also provided an operational tax rate, which is the Companys effective tax rate, a GAAP measure, adjusted
for certain one-time charges.  Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate are considered measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and therefore are non-GAAP measures.  These non-GAAP measures may differ from those of other companies.
 
 
 
 
The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  The non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
