Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
   The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
   On February 9, 2011, the Company issued a press release disclosing its fourth quarter and full year 2010 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, excluding certain unusual items, both of which are considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods.  Earnings from operations, excluding certain unusual items, is presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Fourth Quarter Results
Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $568.2 million, essentially the same level as reported in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 0.3% in total, and 2.5% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter of 2010.  However, sales were negatively impacted by foreign exchange translation resulting from a generally stronger U.S. dollar during the quarter when compared to the same period last year.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $67.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $74.8 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the fourth quarter of 2010 included tax adjustments, charges for restructuring and other costs, impacts related to recent acquisitions and investments that on a net basis decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.04. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in 2009 included positive tax adjustments, charges for restructuring, costs related to recent acquisitions and other related items that on a net basis increased diluted earnings per share by $0.02.
Adjusted earnings (excluding tax adjustments, charges for restructuring, costs related to recent acquisitions and other related items), which constitute a non-GAAP measure, were $73.7 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010.  This compares to $72.6 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009, or an increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share of 6.3% for the quarter.  A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share on a GAAP basis is provided in the attached table.
 
 
 
Full Year Results
Net sales for the full year were $2,221.0 million in 2010, compared to $2,159.4 million in 2009.   Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were $2,031.8 million an increase of 2.1% compared to 2009.  Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 2.6% in 2010 in constant currency, including acquisitions. The Company experienced positive constant currency growth for dental consumable products and dental specialty products for the year.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for 2010 was $265.7 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, compared to $274.3 million, or $1.83 per diluted share in 2009. Net income for the full year of 2010 included a net negative impact from tax adjustments, charges for restructuring, costs related to recent acquisitions and other items, which reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.08 and 2009 included tax adjustments, charges for restructuring, costs related to recent acquisitions and other related items that, on a net basis, reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.01 for the year.
For comparability analysis, net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on a non-GAAP basis was $277.9 million or $1.90 per diluted share for 2010.  This compares with $275.7 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, in 2009, an increase of 3.3%.  A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share on a GAAP basis is provided in the attached table.
2011 Outlook
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, Moving into 2011, we are fortunate to have a number of new and exciting product launches planned.  This, along with a gradually improving dental market, should allow us to improve both our growth rates in sales and earnings for the year. We are cautiously optimistic based on this outlook along with the current exchange rates, and are initiating our 2011 earnings guidance in the range of $2.00 to $2.08 per diluted share.

This press release contains forward-looking information (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.  Actual events or results may differ materially from those in the projections or other forward-looking information set forth herein as a result of certain risk factors. These risk factors include, without limitation; the continued strength of dental markets, the timing, success and market reception for our new and existing products, uncertainty with respect to governmental actions  with respect to dental products, outcome of litigation, continued support of our products by influential dental professionals, and changes in the general economic environment that could affect the business.  Changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results.  For an additional description of risk factors, please refer to the Companys most recent Form 10-K and its subsequent periodic reports on Forms 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the Company provided adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International and adjusted earnings per diluted share.  These adjusted amounts consist of GAAP amounts excluding (1) restructuring and other costs, (2) acquisition-related charges, (3) loss on derivative at an unconsolidated affiliated company, (4) income tax-related adjustments and (5) credit risk adjustments to outstanding derivatives.  Adjusted earnings per diluted share are calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. 
The Company also provided an operational tax rate, which is the Companys effective tax rate, a GAAP measure, adjusted for certain one-time charges.  Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate are considered measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and therefore are non-GAAP measures.  These non-GAAP measures may differ from those of other companies.
The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International, adjusted earnings per diluted share and operating tax rate provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  The non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
