24
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Seller undertakes to the Purchaser that it shall not and it will procure that no other member of the Sellers Group shall during the Restricted Period in any Relevant Capacity:

The Purchaser shall not use or register, and shall procure that no other member of the Purchasers Group nor, after Completion, also any member of the Astra Tech Group, shall use or register, any of the Excluded IP, nor in relation to the Excluded Trade Marks, any name or mark confusingly similar to any of them, except as permitted expressly in this clause 12.

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Purchaser or the Seller or any other member of the Seller's Group, the Purchaser's Group or the Astra Tech Group from making or sending after Completion any announcement to a customer, client or supplier of any member of the Astra Tech Group informing it that the Purchaser has purchased the Shares provided that the form of any such announcement is approved in advance in writing by the Seller and the Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

If all or any part of any provision of this Agreement shall be or become illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect, then the remainder of that provision and/or all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable.  If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable or legal if some part of it was deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to make it valid, enforceable and legal.
 
 
 
No amendment or variation of the terms of this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents shall be effective unless it is made or confirmed in a written document signed by each party to the relevant document, provided that no amendment or variation shall be made to clause 21.4, clause 23.5 or this provision without the written consent of each party to the Funding Commitment Letter.

As from the Completion Date until the date falling six years after the Completion Date, the Seller and the Purchaser shall give to the other (and their respective representatives) such reasonable access to the books, accounts, records and returns of the other relating to or in connection with any member of the Astra Tech Group or the Business as the other may reasonably require including the right to take copies and extracts on reasonable advance notice (at the cost of the party taking them).
 
 
After the Completion Date, either party shall make available to the other such employees of its group as the latter may reasonably require in connection with the conduct of proceedings or otherwise in connection with the Transaction Documents and of which such employees have particular knowledge by virtue of their involvement in the matter giving rise to those proceedings or otherwise.
 
 
If either party identifies a service prior to Completion that:
 
 
 
 
 
the parties shall use their reasonable endeavours to agree a new Schedule (as defined in the Transitional Services Agreement) to formalise the provision of such service for a reasonable period of time which shall be considered as a Service for the purpose of the Transitional Services Agreement only once a formal schedule to the Transitional Services Agreement is agreed in relation to it.
 
 
 
This Agreement and any amendment or variation to it may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by the parties on separate counterparts, but shall not be effective until each of the parties has executed at least one counterpart.
 
 
34
 
 
 
Each counterpart shall constitute an original of this Agreement (or any amendment or variation to it as applicable), but all the counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
 
 
This Agreement shall be binding on and enure for the benefit of the successors and permitted assignees of the parties.
 
 
The benefit of this Agreement may not be assigned, transferred, charged or dealt in (whether by way of security, trust or otherwise) either in whole or in part to any Person without the non assigning party's prior consent, except as provided in clause 21.3.
 
 
Each party may assign all or any of its rights under this Agreement to one or more other members of, in the case of the Seller, the Seller's Group or, in the case of the Purchaser, the Purchaser's Group, subject to the condition that the relevant party will procure that, before any assignee subsequently ceases to be a member of the Seller's Group or the Purchaser's Group as applicable, that assignee shall assign back to the original party, or to another member of the Seller's Group or the Purchaser's Group as applicable (which itself shall then be deemed to be an assignee of the original party for the purposes of this clause), so much of the benefit of this Agreement as has been assigned to it, provided that the liability of each other party as a result of the assignment shall not be greater than its liability had no assignment occurred and that any purported assignment in contravention of this clause shall be void.

The Seller shall cause to be duly held a meeting of the board of directors or, as applicable, the shareholders, of each member of the Astra Tech Group validly to effect or execute or validly to resolve to effect or execute:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to the conclusion of the matters referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Purchaser shall:
 
 
 
 
 
 
40
 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, Completion shall not occur or be deemed to have occurred until all of the above arrangements have been completed (in particular the endorsement of the share certificates representing the Shares to the Purchaser).
 
41
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
42
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which, in each case, have or could have a material adverse affect on the ability of the Seller to execute and deliver or perform its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents.
 
 
The Statutory Accounts present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Astra Tech Group, as a whole, at, as applicable, the Statutory Accounts Date or 31 December 2009 and its financial performance and cash flows for the Financial Years ended on, as applicable, the Statutory Accounts Date or 31 December 2009 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
43
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
44
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
45

48
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
49
 
 
 
So far as the Seller is aware, no member of the Astra Tech Group has breached any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction in which any such member of the Astra Tech Group operates, which breach could reasonably be expected to result in a liability which is material to the Business as a whole.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
50
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
51
 
 
 
 
If, after Completion, the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group becomes aware of any fact, matter, event or circumstance by virtue of which the Seller is or may become liable for a breach of any of the Warranties or under any other provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed, the Purchaser shall as soon as practicable inform the Seller in writing specifying in reasonable detail the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise (or which may give rise) to that liability and, to the extent reasonably possible, providing an estimate of the total amount of that liability.
 
 
 
No claim shall be brought by the Purchaser for breach of the Warranties or under any other provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed unless notice in writing of that claim is given to the Seller not later than:
 
 
 
 
provided that where any obligation, covenant or undertaking of the Seller under this Agreement (i) is given for an indefinite period of time the Purchaser shall be entitled to serve written notice of claim for a breach of such obligation, covenant or undertaking until the 30th Business Day following the relevant breach; or (ii) is subject to a specific term that expires after the date falling 18 months after the Completion Date the Purchaser shall be entitled to serve written notice of claim for a breach of such obligation, covenant or undertaking until the 30th Business Day following the expiry of the relevant specific term.
 
 
The liability of the Seller in respect of a claim notified in accordance with paragraph 2.1 shall absolutely terminate (if that claim has not been previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) if legal proceedings in respect of that claim containing full particulars of it shall not have been properly issued and validly served on the Seller within (i) 12 months after the date of service of that notice if the claim relates to the Tax Deed, or (ii) six months after the date of service of that notice with respect to any other claim.
 
52
 
 
 
The Purchaser shall not be entitled to claim against the Seller for a breach of the Warranties or under any other provision of this Agreement:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
53
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to paragraph 4.2, the aggregate liability of the Seller for a breach of the Warranties or under any other provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed shall not exceed a maximum sum of USD 357,000,000 (three hundred and fifty seven million US dollars) (the (including all legal, accountancy, other professional and any other costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group).
Cap)
 
 
If, prior to expiry of the time period referred to in paragraph 2.1(b) above, the aggregate liability of the Seller for a breach of the Warranties or under any other provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed has reached the Cap then the Cap shall be increased by USD 75,000,000 (seventy five million US dollars) (including all legal, accountancy, other professional and any other costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group) but solely in respect of any future claims by the Purchaser pursuant to clause 6.7 and not in respect of any other claim under this Agreement or the Tax Deed.
 
 
The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover more than once in respect of any fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to Loss under this Agreement to the extent that it or any other member of the Purchasers Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group has recovered such Loss under any provision of this Agreement or of any of the other Transaction Documents.
 
54
 
 
 
If the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group is or would reasonably be likely to recover from some other Person (including insurers) any loss or damage which gives rise to any claim for breach of the Warranties or under any other provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed, the Purchaser shall or shall procure that the relevant member of the Purchaser's Group or the Astra Tech Group shall take all appropriate steps as is reasonable to enforce that recovery (keeping the Seller informed on a timely basis of any action so taken).
 
 
If (i) despite any other provision of this schedule 3 or the Tax Deed, any payment is made by the Seller in or towards the settlement of any claim made for breach of the Warranties or under any other provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed and the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group subsequently recovers or procures the recovery from a Third Party (including insurers) of any amount in respect of that claim, and (ii) the aggregate of such recovery and the sum paid by the Seller exceeds the amount required to compensate the Purchaser in full for the loss or liability which gave rise to the relevant claim (such excess being the ""),  then the Purchaser shall forthwith repay to the Seller an amount equal to whichever is the lesser of:
excess recovery
 
 
 
after deducting (in either case) all documented costs reasonably incurred by the Purchaser and/or any member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group for the recovery.
 
 
If and to the extent that any payment is made by the Seller in or towards the settlement of any claim made for breach of the Warranties or under any other provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed and the related liability, loss or damage suffered or incurred by the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group is subsequently used  by the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group to offset in whole or in part any past, present or future liability to Tax (other than a liability to Tax in respect of which the Purchaser can make a claim under the Tax Deed or under the Warranties relating to Tax) ("") as a result of the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group obtaining a deduction in respect of that loss or damage in computing its income, profits or gains for Tax purposes or in computing the amount of any loss which is set against  other income, profits or gains of the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group for Tax purposes in respect of Tax which would have otherwise been payable (a ""), the Purchaser shall give written notice of that fact to the Seller within five (5) Business Days of becoming aware of the Tax Benefit and an amount equal to the amount by which a payment of Tax is less than would otherwise have been the case shall be dealt with as follows:
Tax Liability
Tax Benefit
 
55
 
 
 
 
and any payment shall be made within five Business Days of the date of the Purchaser's notice. For the purposes of this paragraph 7, Reliefs (as defined in the Tax Deed) and, consequently, the liability, loss or damage referred to in this paragraph 7 (being a type of Relief), shall be treated as used to reduce or extinguish a Tax Liability of the Purchaser, any other member of the Purchaser's Group or any member of the Astra Tech Group in the chronological order in which they arise with older Reliefs being used before newer Reliefs. If and to the extent that all or any part of a Tax Benefit becomes unavailable because of a denial by the relevant Tax Authority of a deduction in respect of the liability, loss or damage that is the subject of this paragraph 7 and in respect of which the Purchaser has made payment to the Seller under this paragraph 7 then the Seller shall repay the Purchaser such proportion of the amount received as corresponds to the proportion of the deduction denied.
 
 
If an actual or threatened claim, action or demand by or liability to a Third Party (a "") results or is likely to result in a claim against the Seller for breach of any of the Warranties or under any other provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed, then:
Third Party Claim
 
 
 
56
