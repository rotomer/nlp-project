If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having a three-month maturity commencing on the second London business day immediately following such Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such time; that if the banks selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting such rates as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR determined with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Determination Date.

All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate for the Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or 0.09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or 0.0987655)), and all dollar amounts will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
 
Promptly upon such determination, the Calculation Agent shall notify the Company and the Trustee (if the Calculation Agent is not the Trustee) of the interest rate for the new Interest Reset Period. Upon request of a Holder of the Floating Rate Notes, the Calculation Agent will provide to such Holder the interest rate in effect on the date of such request and, if determined, the interest rate for the next Interest Reset Period. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating interest on the Floating Rate Notes shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders and the Company, absent manifest errors.

(B) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) to provide the Calculation Agent with a quotation of the rate at which deposits of U.S. dollars having a three-month maturity, commencing on the second London business day immediately following such Interest Determination Date, are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations as calculated by the Calculation Agent. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having a three-month maturity commencing on the second London business day immediately following such Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting such rates as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR determined with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Determination Date.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate for the Notes of this series will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or 0.09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or 0.0987655)), and all dollar amounts will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
 
Promptly upon such determination, the Calculation Agent shall notify the Company and the Trustee (if the Calculation Agent is not the Trustee) of the interest rate for the
 
 
new Interest Reset Period. Upon request of a Holder, the Calculation Agent will provide to such Holder the interest rate in effect on the date of such request and, if determined, the interest rate for the next Interest Reset Period. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating interest on the Notes of this series shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders and the Company, absent manifest errors.

In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures including endorsements, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.

We do not express any opinion as to the effect of any non-Opined on Law on the opinions stated herein.
 
The Indenture and the Note Certificates are referred to herein collectively as the "Transaction Agreements."
 
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions stated herein, we are of the opinion that the Note Certificates have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company and duly executed by the Company under the DGCL, and
 
when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Note Certificates will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms under the laws of the State of New York.

In addition, in rendering the foregoing opinions we have assumed that neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Agreements nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance and sale of the Securities: (i) constitutes or will constitute a violation of, or a default under, any lease, indenture, instrument or other agreement to which the Company or its property is subject, (ii) contravenes or will contravene any order or decree of any governmental authority to which the Company or its property is subject, (iii) violates or will violate any law, rule or regulation to which the Company or its property is subject or (iv) requires the consent, approval,
