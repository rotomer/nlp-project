Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
(d) On May 27, 2011, DENTSPLY International Inc. (the Company) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the Initial Filing) with the Securities and Exchange Commission to report the voting results of its Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 25, 2011 (the Annual Meeting), including, among other matters, the results of the stockholder vote on an advisory proposal concerning the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation.  This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed to amend the Initial Filing to disclose the decision of the Companys Board of Directors as to how frequently the Company will conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation.
As reported in the Initial Filing, at the Annual Meeting, a majority of stockholders voted, on an advisory basis, to conduct future advisory votes every year.  After consideration of this vote and other factors, the Companys Board of Directors decided, at its meeting of September 28, 2011, to adopt a policy of conducting an annual advisory vote on executive compensation, until the next advisory vote on the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation, which is expected to occur no later than the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2017.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
