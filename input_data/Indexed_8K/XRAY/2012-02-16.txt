Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
On February 16, 2012, the
Company issued a press release disclosing its fourth quarter and full year 2011 sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, adjusted for certain charges, both of which are considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from operations, adjusted for certain charges, are presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

DENTSPLY International Inc. Reports
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Results
York, PA - February 16, 2012
- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ: XRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011.
Fourth Quarter Results
Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 were a record $738.0 million, a 29.9% increase from $568.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net sales, excluding precious metals content, of $677.8 million increased 30.0% from $521.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net sales growth was largely driven by acquisitions, but also by solid internal sales growth excluding the orthodontic and Japanese businesses that were impacted by the March, 2011 natural disaster in Japan.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $40.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $0.47 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. On an adjusted basis, excluding amortization of intangible assets and other non-GAAP adjustments, earnings of $0.51 per diluted share were slightly lower than $0.52 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflect the orthodontic supply outage and the weakening of European currencies during the quarter. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated on a GAAP basis is provided on the attached table.
Full Year Results
Net sales for the full year 2011 were a record $2.537 billion, a 14.3% increase over the prior year. Net sales in 2011, excluding precious metal content, were $2.333 billion, a 14.8% increase over 2010. Fiscal 2011 net sales were aided by acquisitions, currency and strengthened internal growth excluding orthodontics and Japan.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for 2011 was $244.5 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, compared to $265.7 million, or $1.82 per diluted share for 2010. On an adjusted basis, excluding amortization of intangible assets and other non-GAAP adjustments, earnings of $2.03 per diluted share increased 4.6% from $1.94 per diluted share in 2010. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share on a GAAP basis is provided on the attached table.
2012 Outlook
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased to report record sales and adjusted earnings for 2011. Our portfolio of new products has been particularly strong, driving market share gains across numerous categories. The global dental market continued to improve in 2011, particularly in the United States where there has been a notable strengthening in underlying demand. Looking ahead to 2012, we expect continued improvement in many of our key markets, despite economic volatility in Europe. Given these factors, we expect adjusted earnings to improve in 2012 to a range of $2.22 to $2.30 per diluted share.

Actual events or results may differ materially from those in the projections or other forward-looking information set forth herein as a result of certain risk factors. These risk factors include, without limitation; the continued strength of dental and medical markets, the timing, success and market reception for our new and existing products, uncertainty with respect to governmental actions with respect to dental and medical products, outcome of litigation, continued support of our products by influential dental and medical professionals, our ability to successfully integrate Astra Tech, risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in the general economic environment that could affect the business.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International and adjusted earnings per diluted common share. These adjusted amounts consist of US GAAP amounts excluding, net of tax (1) acquisition related costs and expensing of purchase price adjustments at an unconsolidated affiliated company, (2) restructuring and other costs, (3) amortization of purchased intangible assets, (4) Orthodontic business continuity costs, (5) income related to credit risk adjustments, (6) certain fair value adjustments at an unconsolidated affiliated company, and (7) income tax related adjustments. Adjusted earnings per diluted common share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International and adjusted earnings per diluted common share are considered measures not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and therefore are non-US GAAP measures. These non-US GAAP measures may differ from other companies. Income tax related adjustments may include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate.
The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International and adjusted earnings per diluted common share provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The non-US GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
