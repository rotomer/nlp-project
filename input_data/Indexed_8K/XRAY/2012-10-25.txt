Item 2.02. - Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
On October 25, 2012, the Company issued a press release disclosing its third quarter sales and earnings. This earnings release references net sales, excluding precious metal content, and net income, adjusted for certain charges, both of which are considered measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, the Company reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. Earnings from operations, adjusted for certain charges, are presented to enhance the comparability between periods. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

For Immediate Release
DENTSPLY International Reports Record Results for the Third Quarter
York, PA - October 25, 2012
- DENTSPLY International Inc. (NASDAQ: XRAY) today announced sales and earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2012. Net sales in the third quarter of 2012 increased 12.3% to $695.7 million from $619.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Net sales, excluding precious metals content, of $647.1 million increased 14.8% from $563.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Constant currency net sales growth, excluding precious metals content, in the third quarter was 20.1%, driven by acquisitions and internal sales growth in each of the U.S., Europe, and Rest of World categories.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the third quarter of 2012 was $53.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $60.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011. On an adjusted basis, excluding certain items, earnings increased to $0.51 per diluted share from $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated on a GAAP basis is provided in the attached table.
Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated DENTSPLY continues to execute well in a global dental market that is relatively stable despite challenging economic trends. We are pleased with our internal growth rate and margin improvement for the third quarter and believe that our business overall continues to outperform the dental market. Based on the company's performance to date and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are updating our full-year adjusted earnings expectations to a range of $2.19 to $2.24 from the prior range of $2.18 to $2.24."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International and adjusted earnings per diluted common share. These adjusted amounts consist of US GAAP amounts excluding, net of tax (1) acquisition related costs, (2) restructuring and other costs, (3) amortization of purchased intangible assets, (4) Orthodontics business continuity costs, (5) income related to credit risk adjustments, (6) certain fair value adjustments at an unconsolidated affiliated company, and (7) income tax related adjustments. Adjusted earnings per diluted common share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International and adjusted earnings per diluted common share are considered measures not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and therefore are non-US GAAP measures. These non-US GAAP measures may differ from other companies. Income tax related adjustments may include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate.
The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income attributable to DENTSPLY International and adjusted earnings per diluted common share provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The non-US GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
