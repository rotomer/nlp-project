SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (date of earliest event reported): June 21, 2002 XEROX CORPORATION (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) New York 1-4471 16-0468020 (State or other (Commission File (IRS Employer jurisdiction of Number) Identification incorporation) No.) 800 Long Ridge Road P. O. Box 1600 Stamford, Connecticut 06904-1600 (Address of principal executive offices)(Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code: (203) 968-3000 Not Applicable (Former name or former address, if changed since last report) 1
Item 5. Other Events. On June 21, 2002, Registrant (or "Xerox Corporation" or "we" or "our" or "us") announced that it had entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Facility") with a group of lenders, replacing the $7 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement dated October 22, 1997 among Registrant, Xerox Credit Corporation and certain Overseas Borrowers, as Borrowers, various Lenders and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, The Chase Manhattan Bank, Citibank, N.A. and Bank One, as Agents (the "Old Revolver"). At that time, we permanently repaid $2.8 billion of the Old Revolver. Accordingly there is currently $4.2 billion outstanding under the New Credit Facility, consisting of three tranches of term loans totaling $2.7 billion and a $1.5 billion revolving facility that includes a $200 million letter of credit sub-facility. The three term loan tranches include a $1.5 billion amortizing "Tranche A" term loan maturing on April 30, 2005, a $500 million "Tranche B" term loan maturing on April 30, 2005, and a $700 million "Tranche C" term loan which matures on September 15, 2002. Xerox Corporation is currently, and will remain, the borrower of all of the term loans. The revolving loans are available, without sub-limit, to Xerox Corporation, Xerox Canada Capital Limited ("XCCL"), Xerox Capital Europe plc ("XCE") and other foreign subsidiaries requested by us from time to time that meet certain qualifications. We are required to repay $400 million of the Tranche A loan and $5 million of the Tranche B loan in semi-annual installments in 2003, and $600 million of the Tranche A loan and $5 million of the Tranche B loan in semi-annual installments in 2004. The remaining portions of the term loans contractually mature on April 30, 2005, but we could be required to repay portions earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, as described below. In addition, all loans under the New Credit Facility mature upon the occurrence of a change of control. Subject to certain limits described in the following paragraph, all obligations under the New Credit Facility are secured by liens on substantially all domestic assets of Xerox Corporation and by liens on the assets of substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries (excluding Xerox Credit Corporation) and are guaranteed by substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, revolving loans outstanding from time to time to XCE (currently $605 million) are also secured by all of XCE's assets and are also guaranteed on an unsecured basis by certain foreign subsidiaries that directly or indirectly own all of the outstanding stock of XCE. Revolving loans outstanding from time to time to XCCL (currently $300 million) are also secured by all of XCCL's assets and are also guaranteed on an unsecured basis by our material Canadian subsidiaries, as defined (although the guaranties of the Canadian subsidiaries will become secured by their assets in the future if certain events occur). Under the terms of certain of our outstanding public bond indentures, the outstanding amount of obligations under the New Credit Facility that can be secured by assets (the "Restricted Assets") of (i) Xerox Corporation and (ii) our non-financing subsidiaries that have a consolidated net worth of at least $100 million, without triggering a requirement to also secure these indentures, is limited to the excess of (a) 20% of our consolidated net worth (as defined in the public bond indentures) over (b) a portion of the outstanding amount of certain other debt that is secured by the Restricted Assets. Accordingly, the amount of the debt secured under the New Credit Facility by the Restricted Assets (the "Restricted Asset Security Amount") will vary from time to time with changes in our consolidated net worth. The Restricted Assets secure the Tranche B loan (up to the Restricted Asset Security Amount); any Restricted Asset Security Amount in excess of the outstanding Tranche B loan secures, on a ratable basis, the other outstanding loans under the New Credit Facility. The assets of XCE, XCCL and many of the subsidiaries guarantying the New Credit Facility are not Restricted Assets because those entities are not restricted subsidiaries as defined in our public bond indentures. Consequently, the amount of debt under the New Credit Facility secured by their assets is not subject to the foregoing limits. 2
The New Credit Facility loans generally bear interest at LIBOR plus 4.50%, except that the Tranche B loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread that varies between 4.00% and 4.50% depending on the Restricted Asset Security Amount in effect from time to time. Specified percentages of any net proceeds we receive from capital market debt issuances, equity issuances or asset sales during the term of the New Credit Facility must be used to reduce the amounts outstanding under the New Credit Facility, and in all cases any such amounts will first be applied to reduce the Tranche C loan. Once the Tranche C loan has been repaid, or to the extent that such proceeds exceed the outstanding Tranche C loan, any such prepayments arising from debt and equity proceeds will first permanently reduce the Tranche A loans, and any amount remaining thereafter will be proportionally allocated to repay the then-outstanding balances of the revolving loans and the Tranche B loans and to reduce the revolving commitment accordingly. Any such prepayments arising from asset sale proceeds will first be proportionally allocated to permanently reduce any outstanding Tranche A loans and Tranche B loans, and any amounts remaining thereafter will be used to repay the revolving loans and to reduce the revolving commitment accordingly. Notwithstanding the foregoing description, the revolving loan commitment cannot be reduced below $1 billion. The New Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on issuance of debt and preferred stock, certain fundamental changes, investments and acquisitions, mergers, certain transactions with affiliates, creation of liens, asset transfers, hedging transactions, payment of dividends, inter-company loans and certain restricted payments, and a requirement to transfer excess foreign cash, as defined, and excess cash of Xerox Credit Corporation to Xerox Corporation in certain circumstances. Despite a general limitation on the creation of liens, the New Credit Facility provides for the creation of liens from time to time in connection with the monetization or other financing of discrete pools of receivables, leases and other financial assets by Xerox Corporation and its subsidiaries. Thus, the New Credit Facility does not affect our ability to continue to monetize our receivables under the agreements with General Electric Capital Corporation and others. No cash dividends can be paid on our Common Stock for the term of the New Credit Facility. Cash dividends may be paid on preferred stock provided there is then no event of default. In addition to other defaults customary for facilities of this type, defaults on debt of, or bankruptcy of, Xerox Corporation or certain subsidiaries would constitute a default under the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility also contains financial covenants which the Old Revolver did not contain, including: * Minimum EBITDA (rolling four quarters, as defined) * Maximum Leverage (total adjusted debt:EBITDA, as defined) * Maximum Capital Expenditures (annual test) * Minimum Consolidated Net Worth (quarterly test, as defined) Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision of the New Credit Facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. Following the repayment of the $2.8 billion portion of the Old Revolver and $1.3 billion in debt that matured this quarter, our current cash position is approximately $1.7 billion. 3
We expect that the higher interest rates under the New Credit Facility will increase our interest expense by approximately $80 million in 2002 and $140 million in 2003, net of interest income and including transaction fees. Copies of the New Credit Facility and related agreements are filed as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Restatement (and any new method of accounting of the character described in clause (b) of the definition of "Restatement"). Except for the Restatement and as otherwise provided in this Section 1.04(b)(ii)(A), no other restatement or other adjustment of any such financial data shall be made for this purpose on account of any other new or additional information that has become known or available to Xerox since the preparation of the initial Business Plan that is or might otherwise be a basis for adjusting any projection or other statement in the initial Business Plan, or any assumption upon which it was based, notwithstanding that the Revised Business Plan otherwise may, as of its date, contain material misstatements or omit to state material facts, it being understood and agreed that the application of Section 3.11 and Section 7.01(c) to the Revised Business Plan is qualified to this extent. The Revised Business Plan shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer of Xerox stating that it has been prepared in accordance with the foregoing requirements. The Revised Business Plan will also be accompanied by a supplement to the initial Business Plan (which, upon delivery, will be considered part of the initial Business Plan), prepared by Xerox in good faith and signed by the Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer of Xerox, in which the projected Consolidated Net Income for Fiscal Years 2003, 2004 and 2005 (which is set forth in the initial Business Plan on only an annual basis) will be broken down on a quarterly basis (but only through the first Fiscal Quarter of Fiscal Year 2005). (B) The Adjustment Certificate shall be prepared by Xerox in good faith and signed by the Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer of Xerox, and shall have attached thereto a Schedule (the "Covenant Re-set Schedule") setting forth the content of Sections 6.13 - 6.15 but with the amounts and ratios included therein in accordance with the following: (1) Minimum Consolidated EBITDA. The minimum Consolidated EBITDA required by Section 6.13 for each period of four consecutive Fiscal Quarters specified therein shall be adjusted to equal the total of (A) the amount set forth opposite the last day of such period in Section 6.13 (before giving effect to the last sentence thereof), plus (or minus) (B) the increase (decrease) of (1) the Consolidated EBITDA for such period contemplated by the Revised Business Plan compared to (2) the Consolidated EBITDA for such period contemplated by the initial Business Plan. 58
(2) Leverage Ratio. The maximum Leverage Ratio permitted by Section 6.14 as of the last day of any Fiscal Quarter specified therein shall be adjusted to equal the ratio, rounded upwards to the nearest 1/10th, of: (a) the excess of (x) the amount of "Covenant Total Debt" set forth opposite such Fiscal Quarter in Schedule 1.04 over (y) the sum of (i) 85% of the amount of net finance receivables as of such day contemplated by the Revised Business Plan and (ii) the excess, if any, of the amount of consolidated cash and cash equivalents of Xerox as of such day contemplated by the Revised Business Plan (other than those subject to Liens) over $1.3 billion, to (b) the sum of (x) the minimum Consolidated EBITDA covenant level determined pursuant to Section 1.04(b)(ii)(B)(1) for the period of four consecutive Fiscal Quarters ending on such day and (y) the amount of "Capitalized Software" set forth opposite the last Fiscal Quarter of such period in Schedule 1.04. (3) Consolidated Net Worth. The minimum Consolidated Net Worth required by Section 6.15 as of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter shall be adjusted to equal: (a) in the case of the Fiscal Quarter ending September 30, 2002, (x) the excess of (i) Consolidated Net Worth as of December 31, 2001 determined by reference to the audited Fiscal Year financial statements delivered pursuant to this Section 1.04(a) over (ii) $1.3 billion, plus (or minus) (y) the increase (decrease) of (i) Consolidated Net Income contemplated by the Revised Business Plan for the first three Fiscal Quarters of Fiscal Year 2002 compared to (ii) Consolidated Net Income contemplated by the initial Business Plan for such three Fiscal Quarters, and 59
(b) in the case of each subsequent Fiscal Quarter through and including the first Fiscal Quarter of Fiscal Year 2005, the sum of the amount determined under Section 1.04(b)(ii)(B)(3) for the immediately preceding Fiscal Quarter plus the increase (or minus the decrease, as the case may be) of (x) Consolidated Net Income contemplated by the Revised Business Plan for such subsequent Fiscal Quarter compared to (y) Consolidated Net Income contemplated by the initial Business Plan for such subsequent Fiscal Quarter. The Adjustment Certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and the computations of, all of the adjustments set forth therein. (c) During the 30-day period following delivery of the Revised Business Plan and the Adjustment Certificate, as and when reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, Xerox will make available one or more Financial Officers, its independent public accountants (with a Financial Officer present) and its financial adviser to review with the Administrative Agent (and any advisers identified by it) the adjustments from the initial Business Plan reflected in the Revised Business Plan (it being understood that (x) the Revised Business Plan shall not be subject to approval of any Agent or any Lender, (y) any such review of the Revised Business Plan by the Administrative Agent (and any advisers) shall be solely for informational purposes and determining Xerox's compliance with Section 1.04(b) and (z) the Revised Business Plan and the outcome of such review thereof by the Administrative Agent (and any advisers) shall only constitute grounds for the delivery of an Objection Notice with respect to any failure by Xerox to comply with Section 1.04(b)) and the basis for, and the computations of, the adjustments set forth in the Adjustment Certificate, and to provide such additional information and responses to other questions as the Administrative Agent (or such advisers) may reasonably request with respect to the Restatement and the application of Section 1.04(b). On or before the last day of such 30-day period, the Administrative Agent may deliver a notice (the "Objection Notice") to Xerox stating that it disagrees with one or more of the adjustments set forth in the Adjustment Certificate, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement. In the event the Administrative Agent delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with this Section 1.04(c), Xerox and the Administrative Agent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve promptly the matters described in the Objection Notice, and any references herein to the Adjustment Certificate, including the Covenant Re-set Schedule, shall mean the Adjustment Certificate and Covenant Re-set Schedule if and as modified by the agreement of Xerox and the Administrative Agent as a result of such negotiations. The Covenant Re-set Date shall be (i) the last day of such 30- 60
day period (or such earlier date as the Administrative Agent notifies Xerox that it does not have any disagreements with the adjustments set forth in the Adjustment Certificate), unless the Administrative Agent delivers an Objection Notice on or prior thereto, or (ii) if the Administrative Agent delivers an Objection Notice, the date an Adjustment Certificate (including a Covenant Re-set Schedule) is agreed to by the Administrative Agent and Xerox following their negotiations (it being understood that such negotiations may result in no actual changes to the previously delivered Adjustment Certificate). (d) Effective automatically on the Covenant Re-set Date, without the requirement of any notice to or action by the Lenders, the covenants in Sections 6.13 - 6.15 shall be replaced in their entirety by the Covenant Re-set Schedule, a copy of which shall be distributed to each Lender by the Administrative Agent promptly after the Covenant Re-set Date and which shall be deemed to be incorporated into this Agreement as if attached hereto. At all times prior to the Covenant Re-set Date, compliance with Sections 6.13 - 6.15 shall be determined without giving effect to the Restatement, the effect of the Restatement (and any new method of accounting of the character described in clause (b) of the definition of "Restatement") on Fiscal Year 2001 and future periods and the effect of Xerox's change as of January 2002 to the new method of lease revenue recognition adopted in connection with the Restatement (and any new method of accounting of the character described in clause (b) of the definition of "Restatement"). (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the occurrence or existence of any Restatement Event shall not constitute or cause a Default hereunder or prevent any Borrower from requesting and receiving any Loan, and the provisions hereof and of the other Loan Documents shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to avoid the foregoing, provided that (A) the foregoing provisions shall not permit any Xerox Company to take or fail to take any action explicitly required not to be taken or to be taken by Sections 5.01 or 5.02 or Article 6 other than as set forth therein with reference to Restatement Events, nor shall the foregoing excuse any Event of Default under Section 7.01(k) on account of any judgment arising out of a Restatement Event or, except as specifically provided therein, any Event of Default under Section 7.01(f)-7.01(j) arising out of or directly or indirectly caused by a Restatement Event and (B) the foregoing shall have no effect on the calculation of Consolidated Net Worth. Furthermore, to the extent that the delivery by any Xerox Company of any financial report or certificate required to be delivered by it hereunder or in any other Loan Document, or the maintenance by any Xerox Company of its books and records, reflects the Restatement, the effect of the Restatement (and any new method of accounting of the character described in clause (b) of the definition of "Restatement") on Fiscal Year 2001 and future periods and the effect of Xerox's 61
change as of January 2002 to the new method of lease revenue recognition adopted in connection with the Restatement (and any new method of accounting of the character described in clause (b) of the definition of "Restatement"), any requirement herein or in any other Loan Document that any such report, certificate or books and records be delivered, prepared or maintained in accordance with past practice or in a consistent manner shall, on and after the Restatement Date, be modified to allow such matters to be reflected. ARTICLE 2 The Credits Section 2.01. Revolving Commitments; Conversion to Term Loans.

Each Lender under the Existing Credit Agreement shall convert into Tranche C Term Loans, Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans a portion of its loans outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement that bears the same proportion to the total amount of its loans outstanding under the Existing Agreement as the initial aggregate principal amount of such Tranche or of the Revolving Loans set forth above bears to $7,000,000,000. Each Lender's Revolving Commitment on and after the Effective Date will be an amount that bears the same proportion to the total amount of its loans outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement as $1,500,000,000 bears to $7,000,000,000. The Tranche C Term Loans, Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans, Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments of each Lender that will be outstanding and exist on the Effective Date are set forth in Appendix I. 62
(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, on and after the Effective Date each Revolving Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrowers from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not, after giving effect to any simultaneous repayment of the Revolving Loans (or reimbursement of any LC Disbursement or cancellation of any Letter of Credit) and the provisions of Section 2.05(b), at any time result in such Lender's Revolving Exposure exceeding its Revolving Commitment. Within such limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow Revolving Loans. Amounts repaid in respect of any Term Loans may not be reborrowed. (c) The Revolving Commitments of the Revolving Lenders are several, i.e., the failure of any Revolving Lender to make any Revolving Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Revolving Lender of its obligations hereunder, and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as and when required hereunder. Section 2.02. Revolving and Term Loans. (a) The Loans comprising each Existing Borrowing shall be Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans, Tranche C Term Loans or Revolving Loans, all as set forth in Appendix II. Each Revolving Loan made after the Effective Date shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Interest Type made by the Revolving Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments as the relevant Borrower may request (subject to Section 2.13) in accordance herewith. Subject to Section 2.18, each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan. Any exercise of such option shall not affect the relevant Borrower's obligation to repay such Loan as provided herein. (b) At the beginning of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Borrowing, the aggregate amount of such Borrowing shall be an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000. When each Base Rate Borrowing is made, the aggregate amount of such Borrowing shall be an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000; provided that a Base Rate Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the Revolving Commitments. Borrowings of more than one Class and Interest Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of 20 Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no Borrower will be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Eurodollar Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Revolving Maturity Date, Tranche A Maturity Date, Tranche B Maturity Date or Tranche C Maturity Date, as applicable. 63
Section 2.03. Requests to Borrow Revolving Loans. To request a Revolving Borrowing, the relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than Noon, New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of a Base Rate Revolving Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.04(e) may be given not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by Xerox and the relevant Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be a Base Rate Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of "Interest Period"; and (v) the location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds (if any) are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.05.

Promptly after it receives a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Revolving Lender as to the details of such Borrowing Request and the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made pursuant thereto. Section 2.04. Letters of Credit. (a) General.

reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the relevant LC Issuing Bank, from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period. If the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by a Borrower to, or entered into by a Borrower with, any LC Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit are not consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal or Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the relevant Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the relevant LC Issuing Bank) to the relevant LC Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 2.04(c)), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the relevant LC Issuing Bank, the relevant Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such LC Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the LC Exposure will not exceed $200,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Exposures will not exceed the total Revolving Commitments. (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or before the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date that is one year after such Letter of Credit is issued (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days before the Revolving Maturity Date. (d) Participations. Effective upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of any LC Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the LC Issuing Banks grant to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender acquires from the relevant LC Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Revolving Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn thereunder. Pursuant to such participations, each Revolving 65
Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant LC Issuing Bank, such Lender's Revolving Percentage of (i) each LC Disbursement made by such LC Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the relevant Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 2.04(e) and (ii) any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the relevant Borrower for any reason. Each Lender's obligation to acquire participations and make payments pursuant to this subsection is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or any reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. (e) Reimbursement. If any LC Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement under a Letter of Credit, the relevant Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying an amount equal to such LC Disbursement to the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day after Xerox receives notice of such LC Disbursement; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is at least $5,000,000 or the entire unused balance of the Revolving Commitments, the relevant Borrower may, without regard to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be made with the proceeds of a Base Rate Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so requested, the relevant Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Base Rate Revolving Borrowing. If the relevant Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Revolving Percentage thereof. Promptly after it receives such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Revolving Percentage of the payment then due from the relevant Borrower, in the same manner as is provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05(c) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to such payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant LC Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. If a Revolving Lender makes a payment pursuant to this subsection to reimburse an LC Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than by funding Base Rate Revolving Loans as contemplated above), (i) such payment will not constitute a Loan and will not relieve the relevant Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement and (ii) such Revolving Lender will be subrogated to its pro rata share of such LC Issuing Bank's claim against such Borrower for such reimbursement. Promptly after the Administrative Agent receives any payment from a Borrower pursuant to this subsection, the Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to the relevant LC Issuing Bank or, if Revolving Lenders 66
have made payments pursuant to this subsection to reimburse an LC Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such LC Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. (f) Obligations Absolute. Each Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any LC Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Borrower's obligations hereunder. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the LC Issuing Banks and their respective Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the relevant LC Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not excuse the LC Issuing Banks from liability to the relevant Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by such LC Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. In the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of an LC Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such LC Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the relevant LC Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either (A) accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or (B) refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 67
(g) Disbursement Procedures. The relevant LC Issuing Bank shall, promptly after its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The relevant LC Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and Xerox by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such LC Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement pursuant thereto; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice will not relieve the relevant Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the relevant LC Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. (h) Interim Interest. Unless the relevant Borrower reimburses an LC Disbursement in full on the day it is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the day on which such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the day on which such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Base Rate Revolving Loans; provided that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.04(e), then Sections 2.12(c) and 2.12(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this subsection shall be for the account of the LC Issuing Banks, except that a pro rata share of interest accrued on and after the day that any Revolving Lender reimburses an LC Issuing Bank for a portion of such LC Disbursement pursuant to Section 2.04(e) shall be for the account of such Lender. (i) Replacement of LC Issuing Banks. Any LC Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among Xerox, the Administrative Agent, the replaced LC Issuing Bank and the successor LC Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement. At the time any such replacement becomes effective, Xerox shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced LC Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(c). On and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor LC Issuing Bank will have all the rights and obligations of an LC Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "LC Issuing Bank" will be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous LC Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous LC Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After an LC Issuing Bank is replaced, it will remain a party hereto and will continue to have all the rights and obligations of an LC Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it before such replacement, but will not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. (j) Cash Collateralization. If an Event of Default has occurred and the Loans then outstanding have been or are concurrently being declared to be due and payable pursuant to Section 7.01, then on the Business Day that Xerox receives notice from the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders or the 68
Required Revolving Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this subsection, the relevant Borrower shall deposit in its Cash Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure attributable to such Borrower as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral will become effective immediately, and such deposit will become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article 7. Any amount so deposited (including any earnings thereon) will be applied to pay the Secured Obligations as provided in the relevant Security Document. Section 2.05. Funding of Revolving and Term Loans. (a) Each Lender making a Revolving Loan hereunder shall (subject to Section 2.05(b)) wire the principal amount thereof in immediately available funds, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the proposed date of such Loan, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall make such funds available to the relevant Borrower by promptly transferring the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained in the United States and designated in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that Base Rate Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) will be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the relevant LC Issuing Bank. (b) If any Lender makes a new Loan to any Borrower on a day on which another Borrower (the "repaying Borrower") is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Loan from such Lender, such Lender shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and only an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be made available by such Lender to the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.05(a), or remitted by the repaying Borrower to the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.17, as the case may be. (c) Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from a Lender before the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make its share of such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.05(a) and may, in reliance on such assumption, make a corresponding amount available to a Borrower. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the day such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment 69
to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Section 2.06. Interest Elections. (a) Each Existing Borrowing initially shall be a Eurodollar Borrowing with an initial Interest Period as set forth in Appendix II. Each Revolving Borrowing made after the Effective Date initially shall be of the Interest Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter (including in the case of any Existing Borrowing), a Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Interest Type or, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, to continue such Borrowing for one or more additional Interest Periods, all as provided in this Section 2.06. A Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.06, the relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting that a Borrowing of the Interest Type resulting from such election be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by Xerox and the relevant Borrower. (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 and Section 2.06(e): (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to Section 2.06(c)(iii) and 2.06(c)(iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election, which shall be a Business Day; 70
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be a Base Rate Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of "Interest Period". If an Interest Election requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, the relevant Borrower will be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. (d) Promptly after it receives an Interest Election, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the relevant Class as to the details thereof and such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e) If the relevant Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing before the end of an Interest Period applicable thereto, such Borrowing (unless repaid) will be converted to a Base Rate Borrowing at the end of such Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies Xerox, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) each Eurodollar Borrowing (unless repaid) will be converted to a Base Rate Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto on the date of such notice. Section 2.07. Termination or Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Revolving Commitments shall be reduced from time to time or terminated in accordance with the terms of Section 2.10(b), and, unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments will terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date. (b) Xerox may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments; provided that (A) the amount of each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be the amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof and (B) Xerox shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayment of Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.10, the total Revolving Exposures would exceed the total Revolving Commitments. (c) Xerox shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under Section 2.07(b), or any required reduction of the Revolving Commitments under Section 2.10(b), at least 71
two Business Days before the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly after it receives any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by Xerox pursuant to this Section will be irrevocable; provided that any such notice terminating the Revolving Commitments may state that it is conditioned on the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by Xerox (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or before the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments will be permanent and will be made ratably among the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments. Section 2.08. Payment at Maturity; Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Borrower unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent on the Revolving Maturity Date, for the account of each Revolving Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Loans attributable to such Borrower. (b) Xerox unconditionally promises to pay the Administrative Agent (i) on the Tranche A Maturity Date, for the account of each Tranche A Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of such Lender's Tranche A Term Loans, (ii) on the Tranche B Maturity Date, for the account of each Tranche B Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of such Lender's Tranche B Term Loans and (iii) on the Tranche C Maturity Date, for the account of each Tranche C Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of such Lender's Tranche C Term Loans. (c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time. (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder (including the Existing Borrowings), the Class and Interest Type thereof and each Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. (e) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to Section 2.08(c) and 2.08(d) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that any failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not 72
affect the Borrowers' obligation to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (f) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the relevant Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in substantially the form of Exhibit G-1, G-2, G-3 or G-4 hereto, as appropriate (each such promissory note is a "Note"). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.05) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). Section 2.09. Scheduled Amortization of Term Loans. (a) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.09(c), Xerox shall repay Tranche A Term Loans on each date set forth below in the aggregate principal amount set forth opposite such date: Date Amount ---- ------ March 31, 2003 $200,000,000 September 30, 2003 $200,000,000 March 31, 2004 $300,000,000 September 30, 2004 $300,000,000 (b) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.09(c), Xerox shall repay Tranche B Term Loans on each date set forth below in the aggregate principal amount set forth opposite such date: Date Amount ---- ------ March 31, 2003 $2,500,000 September 30, 2003 $2,500,000 March 31, 2004 $2,500,000 September 30, 2004 $2,500,000 (c) Except as provided in Sections 2.10(a)(iv) and 2.10(b)(v), any prepayment of Term Loans of any Class will be applied first to reduce the scheduled repayments of the Term Loans of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section in direct order of maturity and second to the amount to be paid at final maturity. Each repayment pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be made 73
together with accrued interest on the amount repaid and any amounts owing under Section 2.15 in respect of such repayment. Section 2.10. Optional and Mandatory Prepayments. (a) Optional Prepayments. (i) Each Borrower will have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the provisions of this Section. (ii) No Borrower will be permitted to prepay any Revolving Loans until such time as the Tranche C Loans are paid in full, unless, after giving effect to any new Borrowing of Revolving Loans being made by another Borrower on the same day or the following Business Day, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans will be unchanged. (iii) Except as set forth in Section 2.10(a)(iv), any optional prepayment of Term Loans shall be applied as follows: first, to the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche C Term Loans until the Tranche C Term Loans are paid in full, second, to the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans until the Tranche A Term Loans are paid in full (which payment shall be applied in direct order of maturity as set forth in Section 2.09(c)) and third, to the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans (which payment shall be applied in direct order of maturity as set forth in Section 2.09(c)). Any such prepayment shall be made together with any premium payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c), accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and all amounts then owing under Section 2.15 in respect of such prepayment. (iv) If the Basket Lien Available Amount has become fixed as contemplated by clause (A) of the definition of "Basket Lien Available Amount" and Xerox at any time thereafter determines in good faith that the Basket Lien Available Amount is an amount that requires it to equally and ratably secure the Debt outstanding under the Reference Indenture (or any other indenture with a provision substantially identical to the Reference Basket Lien Provision), or determines in good faith that it is significantly likely that within 90 days it would be required to do so, then upon five Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Financial Officer setting forth in reasonable detail the computations underlying such determination (and any projections underlying any such significant likelihood)), Xerox may prepay an outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans equal to the amount (rounded upwards to the nearest multiple of $1,000,000) by which the Basket Lien Available Amount must be reduced 74
so that Xerox is not required to equally and ratably secure any such other Debt. Such prepayment shall be made together with any premium payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c), accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and all amounts then owing under Section 2.15 in respect of such prepayment, and such prepayment shall be applied, first, to reduce the principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans payable at maturity and, second, to reduce all then remaining unpaid installments of principal of the Tranche B Term Loans payable pursuant to Section 2.09 in inverse order of maturity. (b) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) Asset Transfers. Within three Business Days after Xerox or any Wholly-Owned Domestic Subsidiary receives any Net Proceeds of any Included Asset Transfer, Xerox shall prepay an aggregate amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of such Net Proceeds as follows: first, an outstanding principal amount of the Tranche C Term Loans until the Tranche C Term Loans have been paid in full, second, an outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans, allocated ratably based on outstanding principal amount, until such Loans have been paid in full (which payment shall be applied in direct order of maturity as set forth in Section 2.09(c)) and third, an outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans (and in connection with any prepayment pursuant to this clause third the Revolving Commitments shall be permanently reduced (but not to an amount less than $1,000,000,000) by an amount equal to the amount of such prepayment plus, if the amount of Net Proceeds available after application pursuant to clauses first and second exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans, the amount of such excess). Such prepayment shall be made together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and all amounts then owing under Section 2.15 in respect of such prepayment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Net Proceeds of any Included Asset Transfer are less than $75,000,000, Xerox shall not be required to make any prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.10(b)(i) until the aggregate Net Proceeds of Included Asset Transfers not so applied equal or exceed $75,000,000. (ii) Debt and Equity Issuances. Within (A) three Business Days after Xerox or any Finance SPE that is a Domestic Subsidiary receives any Net Proceeds of any Covered Capital Markets Debt or Equity Issuance and (B) five Business Days after XCE or any Finance SPE that is a Foreign Subsidiary receives any Net Proceeds of any Covered Capital Markets Debt or Equity Issuance, Xerox shall prepay an aggregate amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of such Net Proceeds as follows: first, an outstanding principal amount of the Tranche C Term Loans until the Tranche C Term Loans have been paid in full, second, an outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans until the Tranche A Term Loans have been paid in full (which payment shall be applied in direct 75
order of maturity as set forth in Section 2.09(c)) and third, an outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans and the Revolving Loans, allocated ratably based on outstanding principal amount (which payment of Tranche B Term Loans shall be applied in direct order of maturity as set forth in Section 2.09(c)), and in connection with any prepayment pursuant to this clause third the Revolving Commitments shall be permanently reduced (but not to an amount less than $1,000,000,000) by an amount equal to the amount of such prepayment of the Revolving Loans plus, if the amount of Net Proceeds available after application pursuant to clauses first and second exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans and the Revolving Loans, the amount of such excess). Such prepayment shall be made together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and all amounts then owing under Section 2.15 in respect of such prepayment. (iii) Casualty Events. Within thirty Business Days after any Credit Party receives any Net Proceeds of any Casualty Event, Xerox shall prepay an aggregate amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of such Net Proceeds as follows: first, an outstanding principal amount of the Tranche C Term Loans until the Tranche C Term Loans are paid in full, second, an outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans, allocated ratably based on outstanding principal amount, until such Loans have been paid in full (which payment shall be applied in direct order of maturity as set forth in Section 2.09(c)) and third, an outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans (and in connection with any prepayment pursuant to this clause third the Revolving Commitments shall be permanently reduced (but not to an amount less than $1,000,000,000) by an amount equal to the amount of such prepayment plus, if the amount of Net Proceeds available after application pursuant to clauses first and second exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans, the amount of such excess); provided that, if Xerox shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect that (A) such Credit Party intends to apply the Net Proceeds from such event (or a portion thereof specified in such certificate), within 360 days after receipt of such Net Proceeds, to repair, restore or replace the property with respect to which such Net Proceeds were received, (B) if such property is to be replaced, the property acquired to replace it will be included in the Collateral at least to the extent that the property to be replaced was included therein and (C) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment will be required pursuant to this subsection in respect of such Net Proceeds (or the portion of such Net Proceeds specified in such certificate, if applicable) except that, if any such Net Proceeds have not been so applied by the end of such 360-day period, a prepayment will be required at that time in an amount 76
equal to the amount of such Net Proceeds that have not been so applied (unless a binding commitment with a third party to repair or replace the applicable asset is in effect). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Net Proceeds of any Casualty Event are less than $75,000,000, Xerox shall not be required to make any prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.10(b)(iii) until the aggregate Net Proceeds of Casualty Events not so applied equal or exceed $75,000,000. Such prepayment shall be made together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and all amounts then owing under Section 2.15 in respect of such prepayment. (iv) Change in Control. Within 15 days after any Change in Control, Xerox shall prepay all outstanding Term Loans and Revolving Loans in full and deposit in the Cash Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure as of such date. Upon the occurrence of any Change in Control, the Revolving Commitments shall automatically terminate. Such prepayment shall be made together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and all amounts then owing under Section 2.15 in respect of such prepayment. (v) If as of the last day of any Fiscal Quarter the Basket Lien Available Amount has become fixed as contemplated by clause (A)(2) of the definition of "Basket Lien Available Amount", and as of the last day of the immediately succeeding Fiscal Quarter, the Basket Lien Principal Amount determined as of such date (notwithstanding the fact that the Basket Lien Available Amount has previously become fixed) is less than the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans (such difference is the "shortfall"), Xerox shall prepay, within three Business Days after the delivery of the compliance certificate required pursuant to Section 5.01(c) with respect to such succeeding Fiscal Quarter, or, if such Fiscal Quarter is the fourth Quarter of a Fiscal Year, such Fiscal Year, an aggregate amount of Tranche B Term Loans equal to the shortfall. Such prepayment shall be made together with any premium payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c), accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and all amounts then owing under Section 2.15 in respect of such prepayment, and such prepayment shall be applied, first, to reduce the principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans payable at maturity and, second, to reduce all then remaining unpaid installments of principal of the Tranche B Term Loans payable pursuant to Section 2.09 in inverse order of maturity. (c) Prepayment Premium. In the case of the prepayment of any Tranche B Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or 2.10(b)(v) prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date, Xerox shall also pay a premium for the account of each Tranche B Lender in an amount equal to the Applicable Premium 77
Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans being prepaid. (d) Partial Prepayments. Each partial prepayment of a Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted under Section 2.02(b) for a Borrowing of the same Interest Type, except as needed to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each partial prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in such Borrowing. (e) Notice of Prepayments. Xerox shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment of any Borrowing hereunder (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, two Business Days before the date of prepayment and (ii) in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.07(c), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07(c). Promptly after it receives any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Section 2.11. Fees. (a) Xerox shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the Revolving Availability Period. Accrued commitment fees will be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and the day when the Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such day to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees will be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and will be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, a Lender's Revolving Commitment will be deemed to be used to the extent of its outstanding Revolving Loans. (b) On the Effective Date, Xerox shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a restructuring fee in an amount equal to 1.25% of the amount of such Lender's Loans outstanding after giving effect to the Initial Paydown (determined on a pro forma basis assuming that the Tranche C Paydown was made on the Effective Date). 78
(c) Xerox shall pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue for each day, at the Applicable Rate that applies to Eurodollar Revolving Loans, on the amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) on such day, during the period from the Effective Date to the later of the date on which such Lender's Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each LC Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which, subject to any different agreement as to the basis of calculation between Xerox and such LC Issuing Bank, shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon by the relevant Borrower and such LC Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such LC Issuing Bank (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from the Effective Date to the later of the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such LC Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to issuing, amending, renewing or extending any Letter of Credit or processing drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through the last day of March, June, September and December of each year will be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees accrued to the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate will be payable on such date, and any such fees accruing after such date will be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the LC Issuing Banks pursuant to this subsection will be payable within 15 days after demand. All such participation fees and fronting fees will be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and will be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (d) Xerox shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account (including in its capacity as Collateral Agent), fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon by Xerox and the Administrative Agent. (e) Xerox shall pay to the Arrangers, for their own accounts, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon by Xerox and the Arrangers. (f) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the relevant LC Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. 79
Section 2.12. Interest. (a) The Base Rate Loans of each Class shall bear interest for each day at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for such Class. (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing of each Class shall bear interest for each Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate for such Class (it being understood that although the Existing Borrowings will, for their initial Interest Periods, continue to have the same Adjusted LIBO Rates, determined under the Existing Credit Agreement, as are applicable to currently effective interest periods, all as specified on Appendix II, interest accrued for such Interest Periods on and after the Effective Date will be calculated using the Applicable Rate). (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default under Section 7.01(h), 7.01(i) or 7.01(j) has occurred and is continuing or if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, has given notice to Xerox specifying the application of this Section 2.12(c), then during the continuance of such Event of Default, the interest rates applicable to the Loans and all fees and other amounts payable by any Borrower hereunder shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding subsections of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Revolving Loans. (d) Interest accrued on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (A) interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.12(c) shall be payable on demand, (B) upon any repayment of any Loan (except a prepayment of a Base Rate Revolving Loan before the end of the Revolving Availability Period), interest accrued on the principal amount repaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment and (C) upon any conversion of a Eurodollar Loan before the end of the current Interest Period therefor, interest accrued on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. (e) All interest hereunder will be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate will be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case will be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Each applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO 80
Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and its determination thereof will be conclusive absent manifest error. (f) For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of interest or fees provided in this Agreement and each Note (and stated herein or therein as applicable to be computed on the basis of a 365 day year or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent are the rates so determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 365 or such other period of time. Section 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If before the beginning of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing: (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or (ii) Lenders whose Loans to be included in such Borrowing aggregate at least 51% thereof advise the Administrative Agent that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to Xerox and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies Xerox and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing will be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing will be made as a Base Rate Borrowing; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Class of Borrowings, then the other Classes of Borrowings shall be permitted to be Eurodollar Borrowings. Section 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any LC Issuing Bank; or 81
(ii) impose on any Lender or any LC Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost (other than an increase in Taxes, which increase is dealt with exclusively in Section 2.16) to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans) or to increase the cost to such Lender or LC Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender or LC Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then Xerox shall pay to such Lender or LC Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate it for such additional cost incurred or reduction suffered. (b) If any Lender or LC Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or LC Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or LC Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender or the Letters of Credit issued by such LC Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or LC Issuing Bank or such Lender's or LC Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or LC Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or LC Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Xerox shall pay to such Lender or LC Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate it or its holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) A certificate of a Lender or an LC Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and the calculation of, the amount or amounts necessary to compensate it or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 2.14(a) or 2.14(b) shall be delivered to Xerox and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Xerox shall pay such Lender or LC Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof. (d) Failure or delay by any Lender or LC Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.14 will not constitute a waiver of its right to demand such compensation; provided that Xerox will not be required to compensate a Lender or LC Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.14 for any increased cost or reduction incurred more than 270 days before it notifies Xerox of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased cost or reduction and of its 82
intention to claim compensation therefor. However, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased cost or reduction is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above will be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. (e) This Section 2.14 shall not apply to any Change in Law that imposes or increases the amount of any Tax. Section 2.15. Break Funding Payments. If (a) any principal of any Eurodollar Loan is repaid on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default but excluding any principal amount that is simultaneously reborrowed by another Borrower as contemplated by Section 2.05(b)), (b) any Eurodollar Loan is converted on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) any Borrower fails to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(e) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) any Eurodollar Loan is assigned on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by any Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then such Borrower shall compensate each Lender for its loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost and expense to any Lender shall be deemed to be equal to an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the end of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have begun on the date of such failure), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the beginning of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and the calculation of, any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be delivered to Xerox and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The relevant Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof. Section 2.16. Taxes. (a) All payments by the Borrowers under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (A) the sum payable will be increased as necessary so that, after all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this 83
Section) are made, each relevant Lender Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (B) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (C) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. (b) In addition, each Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the extent required to be withheld or paid by such Borrower to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender Party, within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid or incurred by such Lender Party with respect to any payment by or obligation of such Borrower under the Loan Documents (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) and any expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Each Lender Party shall make a good faith effort to verify that such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are correctly and legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. An officer's certificate as to the amount of any such payment delivered to Xerox by a Lender Party on its own behalf, or by the Administrative Agent on behalf of a Lender Party, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Within 15 Business Days after any Borrower pays any Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes or any withholding tax that is an Excluded Tax to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment. Each Borrower shall promptly furnish to each Lender Party any other information, documents and receipts that the Lender Party may from time to time reasonably request to establish to its satisfaction that full and timely payment of all Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes has been made. The applicable Borrower will be deemed to have satisfied the requirement of this Section 2.16(d) if it has furnished such information, documents and/or receipts to the Administrative Agent. (e) Any Lender Party that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax imposed by Canada or the United Kingdom with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) within 15 Business Days following receipt of the written notice referred to below, such properly completed and executed documentation as is reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent in order to permit such payments to be made with the benefit of such 84
exemption or reduction (and shall make application to the relevant Governmental Authority for exemption or reduced rates if it is the party required by law to do so), provided that such Lender Party has received written notice from such Borrower or the Administrative Agent identifying the requirements for such exemption or reduction, supplying all applicable documentation and specifying the time period within which documentation is to be provided under this paragraph 2.16(e) (or such application is to be made). Without limiting the Lender Parties' obligations under the preceding sentence, each Lender Party agrees that it will, without material cost or other material disadvantage (as determined in such Lender Party's good faith judgment), cooperate with such Borrower to minimize the applicable withholding tax burdens in Canada and the United Kingdom. If any Lender Party becomes subject to any Tax because it fails to comply with this subsection 2.16(e), each Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender Party shall reasonably request to assist such Lender Party to recover such Tax. The Administrative Agent agrees that it will provide administrative and ministerial cooperation to each Borrower with respect to (i) procedures for reducing or eliminating the withholding taxes imposed by Canada or the United Kingdom on payments to the Lender Parties and (ii) the reporting, withholding and remitting of Taxes to the appropriate Governmental Authority and shall administer such reporting, withholding and remitting in a manner consistent with its practice under the Existing Credit Agreement, provided that such cooperation shall not impose upon the Administrative Agent greater burdens than those that have arisen in the administration of the Existing Credit Agreement unless such greater burdens are attributable to changes in Applicable Law or procedures with respect to any such taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Borrowers shall retain primary responsibility for ascertaining the requirements of Applicable Law and providing to the Lender Parties the written notice described in the first sentence of this paragraph, and (ii) no failure by the Administrative Agent to meet any obligations under this paragraph shall operate to excuse any Borrower from its obligations to the Lender Parties under this Section 2.16. (f) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party receives a cash refund of any Indemnified Tax or Other Tax deducted, withheld or paid by any Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.16 from the Governmental Authority that imposed such tax, which in the good faith judgement of the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party is allocable to such deduction, withholding or payment and is not (or is no longer) subject to return, reassessment or other repayment to such Governmental Authority, the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party shall promptly pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such cash refund, net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party in obtaining such cash refund. (g) Each Foreign Lender shall provide Xerox (or its designated paying agent) within the time periods required by Applicable Law with Internal Revenue 85
Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, (or any successor form) certifying to the effect that (i) such Foreign Lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty that exempts such Foreign Lender from United States withholding tax or reduces the rate of such tax on payments of interest (or is otherwise exempt) or (ii) such interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If and to the extent that such withholding tax is an Excluded Tax, Xerox will determine the amount of any applicable United States withholding tax (or the exemption therefrom) on the basis of such certification (or prior certification under the Existing Credit Agreement), except to the extent that Xerox has actual knowledge of the incorrectness of such certification and provides written notice thereof to the relevant Foreign Lender at least 10 Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. The parties agree otherwise to cooperate with respect to United States withholding tax matters in a manner consistent with the principles of Section 2.16(e) above, mutatis mutandis. Section 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it under the Loan Documents (whether of principal, interest or fees, or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 or otherwise) before the time expressly required under the relevant Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, before 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amount received after such time on any day may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 1 Bank One Plaza, Chicago, Illinois, 60670, except payments to be made directly to an LC Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.04 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payment received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly after receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment will be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, if such payment accrues interest, interest thereon will be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to 86
such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or any of its participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (A) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (B) the provisions of this Section 2.17(c) shall not apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.17(c) shall apply). Each of the Borrowers consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. (d) Unless, before the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of one or more Lender Parties hereunder, the Administrative Agent receives from Xerox notice that the relevant Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance on such assumption, distribute to each relevant Lender Party the amount due to it. In such event, if the relevant Borrower has not in fact made such payment, each Lender Party severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender Party with interest thereon, for each day from and including the day such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the day it repays the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the 87
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. (e) If any Lender fails to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d), 2.04(e), 2.05(c), 2.17(d) or 9.04(c), the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. Section 2.18. Lender's Obligation to Mitigate; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The relevant Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then Xerox may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.05), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (A) Xerox shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the LC Issuing Banks) in accordance with Section 9.05(b)(A) and (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the relevant Borrower (in the case of all other amounts). A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Xerox to require such assignment cease to apply. 88
Section 2.19. Designation of Overseas Borrower; Termination of Designations. (a) Xerox may from time to time designate any Qualified Foreign Subsidiary as an additional Overseas Borrower for purposes of this Agreement by delivering to the Administrative Agent an Election to Participate duly executed on behalf of such Subsidiary and Xerox in such number of copies as the Administrative Agent may request. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such Election to Participate. (b) Xerox may at any time terminate the status of any Subsidiary as an Overseas Borrower for purposes of this Agreement by delivering to the Administrative Agent an Election to Terminate duly executed on behalf of such Subsidiary and Xerox in such number of copies as the Administrative Agent may request. The delivery of such an Election to Terminate shall not affect any obligation of such Subsidiary theretofore incurred under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any rights of the Lenders and the Agents against such Subsidiary or against Xerox in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of such Subsidiary. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such Election to Terminate. Section 2.20. Overseas Borrower Costs. (a) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan to an Overseas Borrower is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender or its applicable lending office is reduced) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Overseas Borrower is incorporated in, or conducts business in, a jurisdiction outside the United States, such Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent). The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any Excluded Taxes or Taxes addressed in Section 2.16. A certificate of such Lender claiming compensation under this Section 2.20 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (b) Each Lender will promptly notify the relevant Overseas Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event or circumstance of which it has knowledge that will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.20 and will designate a different applicable lending office, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 89
ARTICLE 3 Representations and Warranties Each Borrower represents and warrants (as to itself and, to the extent required by the context, its Subsidiaries only) to the Lender Parties that: Section 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each Credit Party is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where failures to do so, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required. Section 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions to be entered into by each Credit Party are within its corporate (or equivalent) powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate (or equivalent) and, if required, stockholder (or equivalent) action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Credit Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Credit Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Borrower or other Credit Party, as the case may be, in each case enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. Section 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or other action by, any Governmental Authority, except (i) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and (ii) filings, registrations and recordings necessary to perfect the Transaction Liens, (b) will not violate any Applicable Law or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of any Credit Party, (c) will not violate any order of any Governmental Authority, except in any such case where such violation could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (d) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture or other agreement governing Debt or other material agreement or other instrument binding upon any Xerox Company or any of its properties, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any Xerox Company to make any payment thereof (it being understood that any decrease in the consolidated net worth of Xerox following any fixing of the Basket Lien Available Amount could result in a default under various Debt agreements), and (e) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any property of any Xerox Company, other than the 90
Transaction Liens (which include the equal and ratable Liens securing the ESOP Notes and the XCFI Debentures). Section 3.04. Financial Statements; No Material Adverse Change. (a) Xerox has heretofore furnished to the Lenders (i) its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2000 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the Fiscal Year then ended, reported on by KPMG LLP, independent public accountants, and (ii) its consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2001 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the Fiscal Quarter then ended and for the portion of the Fiscal Year then ended, all certified by a Financial Officer, it being understood that such financial statements do not give effect to the Restatement. Except for changes resulting from any Restatement Event, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Xerox and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and their results of operations and cash flows for such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in this Section 3.04(a)(ii). (b) After giving effect to the Transactions, none of the Xerox Companies has, as of the Effective Date, any material contingent liabilities, unusual long-term commitments or unrealized losses which are required to be disclosed pursuant to GAAP, except as disclosed in the financial statements referred to above or the notes thereto or in the Business Plan, except for those that may arise from any Restatement Event and except for the Disclosed Matters and those contingent liabilities, unusual long-term commitments and unrealized losses that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. (c) Except for the Disclosed Matters and any Restatement Event, since December 31, 2000, there has been no material adverse change in the business, assets, operations or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Xerox Companies, taken as a whole. Section 3.05. Properties. (a) Except for the Disclosed Matters, each Xerox Company has good title to, or valid license or leasehold interests in, all real and personal property material to its business (including all its Mortgaged Properties), except for Liens permitted by Section 6.02 and defects in title that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters, each Xerox Company owns, or is licensed to use, all Intellectual Property material to its business, and to the knowledge of a Responsible Officer the use thereof by the Xerox Companies does not infringe upon the Intellectual Property rights of any other Person, except for 91
any such failures of the foregoing to be true that, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Letters of Credit will be requested and used only to support standby obligations, and no such Letter of Credit shall be permitted if, after giving effect to the issuance thereof, the aggregate face amount of all letters of credit issued and outstanding either as (a) Letters of Credit or (b) letters of credit not issued pursuant to this Agreement with reimbursement obligations that are secured by cash collateral pursuant to Section 6.02(k), in each case for purposes other than supporting obligations of Ridge Re, would exceed $195,000,000. 106
Section 5.11. Additional Subsidiaries. (a) (i) If any additional Subsidiary is formed or acquired after the Effective Date, Xerox will promptly (but in any event within 20 Business Days of the occurrence of such event) after such Subsidiary is formed or acquired, notify the Administrative Agent thereof and (ii) if (A) such Subsidiary is a Material Subsidiary that is directly owned by a Domestic Credit Party or a Foreign Credit Party or (B) a Domestic Subsidiary with respect to which Xerox has delivered an Immaterial Subsidiary Certificate or a Foreign Subsidiary with respect to which Xerox has delivered an Immaterial Subsidiary Certificate for purposes of clause (a) of the definition of "Material Foreign Subsidiary" becomes a Material Subsidiary that is directly owned by a Domestic Credit Party or a Foreign Credit Party, Xerox will promptly cause the outstanding Equity Interests of such Subsidiary to be pledged to the extent required by the relevant Security Document (except that (x) no more than 65% of the outstanding voting Equity Interests in any Material Foreign Subsidiary that is a corporation for United States Federal income tax purposes shall be pledged to secure the obligations of Xerox or any Domestic Subsidiary (either directly or through any entity that is a disregarded entity for such purposes) and (y) no Foreign Credit Party shall be required to pledge Equity Interests in any Person other than Material Foreign Subsidiaries directly owned by it and organized under the laws of the same country as such Credit Party (or any state, province or other political subdivision thereof)) and deliver or cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent all certificates or other instruments representing such Equity Interests, together with stock powers or other instruments of transfer with respect thereto endorsed in blank; provided that the Agents may agree in their discretion, with respect to any pledge of the Equity Interests in any Material Foreign Subsidiary described in this clause (ii), that the pledge of such Equity Interests is impossible, impractical or unreasonably burdensome or expensive (or has been substantially, but not fully, completed) and the Agents may, in their respective good faith discretion, consent to a waiver of the pledge of any such Equity Interests. In acting pursuant to the foregoing proviso, each Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of Article 8 of this Agreement, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lenders hereby authorize the Agents, in their sole discretion and from time to time, to grant such waivers and hereby confirm and agree, without limiting the generality of Article 8 of this Agreement, that in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, no Agent shall be liable to any Lender on account of granting any such waiver and any consequences thereof. (b) If (i)(A) any additional Subsidiary referred to in Section 5.11(a) (other than a Subsidiary formed or acquired pursuant to Section 6.04(a)(xvi)) is or subsequently becomes a Wholly-Owned Material Domestic Subsidiary, a Wholly-Owned Material Canadian Subsidiary or a Foreign Subsidiary that is required to be a Foreign Guarantor pursuant to Section 5.14(a) or (B) a Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor on the Effective Date becomes a Wholly-Owned Material Domestic Subsidiary, a Wholly-Owned Material Canadian 107
Subsidiary or a Foreign Subsidiary that is required to be a Foreign Guarantor pursuant to Section 5.14(a) (other than, in each case, a Subsidiary that is not a Xerox Group Company) and (ii) such Subsidiary is not prohibited by Applicable Law or legally valid contractual restrictions in effect on the date hereof or otherwise permitted by Section 6.10 (or, in the case of a Finance SPE, legally valid and customary contractual restrictions or other legally valid contractual restrictions entered into in connection with the Third Party Vendor Financing Program) from guaranteeing one or more Borrowers' obligations hereunder and, from time to time and pursuant to the relevant Security Document, securing such guarantee, Xerox shall promptly cause such Subsidiary to deliver a duly executed supplement to the relevant Security Documents, in the form specified therein, to the Administrative Agent, whereupon such Subsidiary will become a "Domestic Guarantor" or "Foreign Guarantor" and, from time to time, "Lien Grantor" for purposes of the Loan Documents. In addition, Xerox may, at its option, designate as a Guarantor any other Subsidiary that is not a Wholly-Owned Material Subsidiary. If any Subsidiary is so designated, Xerox shall promptly cause such Subsidiary to deliver a duly executed supplement to the relevant Security Documents, in the form specified therein, to the Administrative Agent, whereupon such Subsidiary will become a "Guarantor" and, from time to time, a "Lien Grantor" for purposes of the Loan Documents. Section 5.12. Subsidiary Cash. (a) If (i) on the last day of any Fiscal Quarter, the Cash Balances of the Wholly-Owned Foreign Subsidiaries that are Xerox Group Companies taken as a whole exceed their aggregate Ordinary Course Needs (such excess, "Excess Foreign Cash") or (ii) any Wholly-Owned Foreign Subsidiary receives Net Proceeds of an Included Asset Transfer, or XCE or any Foreign Subsidiary that is a Finance SPE receives Net Proceeds of an issuance of Covered Capital Markets Debt or an Equity Issuance permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(b)(ii), which in each case is not an Excepted Transaction ("Foreign Net Cash Proceeds"), then Xerox shall as promptly as practicable cause an amount equal to such Excess Foreign Cash (net of any Taxes described below) or the Applicable Percentage of Foreign Net Cash Proceeds effectively to be transferred directly or indirectly to Xerox (and, in the case of any Foreign Net Cash Proceeds, applied as provided in Section 2.10), provided that, except with respect to any Planned Qualified Receivables Transaction of a type described in clause (a) of the definition thereof consummated prior to the payment in full of the Tranche C Term Loans or the issuance of any Covered Capital Markets Debt by XCE or any Foreign Subsidiary that is a Finance SPE, (A) such transfer or application shall not be required to the extent that (1) it cannot be made in a tax efficient manner (as determined under Section 5.12(b)) or (2) such transfer or application would violate any applicable contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement or otherwise permitted by Section 6.10 or would violate Applicable Law or if Applicable Law would require minority shareholder approval, a valuation or a discretionary order or would, in the good faith determination of 108
Xerox or a majority of the Board of Directors of such Foreign Subsidiary, involve a reasonable likelihood of there being a breach of fiduciary duties by the directors of such Foreign Subsidiary and (B) it is understood and agreed that (1) Xerox may subsequently re-transfer any such Excess Foreign Cash to any Foreign Subsidiary, as provided in Section 6.04 and (2) in connection with managing transfers of Excess Foreign Cash pursuant to this Section 5.12 and making loans, investments and other advances to Foreign Subsidiaries permitted by Section 6.04, Xerox may cause Excess Foreign Cash to be transferred among Foreign Subsidiaries, rather than transferred to it, in lieu of loans, investments or other advances it would otherwise be permitted to make and would make pursuant to Section 6.04. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) in the case of any Foreign Net Cash Proceeds that would otherwise be required to be transferred to Xerox pursuant to this Section 5.12(a), Xerox need not make such transfer if it nonetheless makes the related mandatory prepayment that would otherwise be required by Section 2.10(b)(i) or 2.10(b)(ii) using funds not otherwise required to be made the basis of any mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10 and (b) if the Foreign Net Cash Proceeds of an Included Asset Transfer are less than $75,000,000, Xerox shall not be required to cause the Applicable Percentage of such Foreign Net Cash Proceeds effectively to be transferred directly or indirectly to Xerox and applied as provided in Section 2.10(b)(i) until the aggregate Foreign Net Cash Proceeds of Included Asset Transfers not so applied equal or exceed $75,000,000. (b) For purposes of Section 5.12(a), the parties agree that a transfer or application of funds (the "Proposed Transfer") cannot be made in a tax efficient manner if and only if in the good faith judgement of Xerox (i) the aggregate amount of projected Taxes to be incurred by Xerox and all of its Subsidiaries if the Proposed Transfer is made exceeds the aggregate amount of such projected Taxes if the Proposed Transfer is not made by more than the Threshold Amount; and (ii) there is no reasonably practicable alternative transaction or transactions that would result in the receipt by Xerox of such Excess Foreign Cash or Foreign Net Cash Proceeds at a cost less than or equal to the Threshold Amount. For purposes of clause (i) above, Taxes shall be projected on the basis of: (A) reasonable, good faith estimates of income, expenses and cash flows, and (B) the overall net Tax cost to Xerox and its Subsidiaries, taking into account (without duplication) (1) all applicable Taxes for the fiscal year of the Proposed Transfer, (2) all credits and deductions in respect of taxes paid or accrued that are available for such fiscal year, 109
and (3) all carryovers of prior net operating losses or other tax attributes to such fiscal year but without taking into account any carryover of tax attributes from such fiscal year to any future fiscal year. For purposes of clause (ii) above Xerox shall give consideration in good faith to whether the Proposed Transfer can be effected indirectly through other wholly-owned subsidiaries. (c) If on the last day of any Fiscal Quarter XCC's Cash Balance exceeds the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of Debt and other obligations of XCC required to be repaid at any time within the next succeeding Fiscal Quarter, plus the amount of accrued interest premium, and other amounts that will be payable on the principal amount to be repaid, and (ii) such other amounts as XCC determines in good faith as are required to meet its ordinary course expenses during the succeeding Fiscal Quarter, then Xerox shall no later than the second Business Day of the next succeeding month cause an amount equal to such excess to be directly or indirectly transferred to it (which transfer may take, without limitation, the form of a demand loan or other advance from XCC to Xerox). On and after the date hereof, Xerox will not, nor will it permit any other Subsidiary to, make any loan, advance or other payment of money to XCC, repay any loan, advance or other obligation owing to XCC (other than any repayment all of the proceeds of which are applied on the Closing Date to repay loans of XCC outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement pursuant to Section 4.01(c)) or sell or otherwise transfer any asset to XCC, except that Xerox Companies may (A) make loans, advances or other payments of money to XCC, or repay any loan, advance or other obligation owing to XCC, in an amount necessary, when added to XCC's Cash Balance (plus any other funds expected to be timely available to it), to enable XCC (1) to repay, together with accrued interest, any principal amount of Debt required to be repaid within 5 Business Days of such payment of money to XCC or (2) to repay or repurchase any Capital Markets Debt of XCC in connection with an issuance by Xerox of XCC Exchange Debt and (B) make any payment to XCC required by the Support Agreement or the Operating Agreement. Section 5.13. Post-Closing Collateral and Guarantees. (a) Within 75 days following the Effective Date, Xerox will cause an appraisal to be completed for the facilities located in Henrietta, New York and Rochester, New York by an appraiser and pursuant to instructions reasonably acceptable to the Agents. Within 90 days following the Effective Date, each relevant Credit Party shall cause the Post-Closing Collateral and Guarantee Requirement to be satisfied. (b) Within 90 days following the Restatement Date, Xerox will (i) deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer (the "Domestic Subsidiary Update Certificate") setting forth the names of each Material Domestic Subsidiary, determined pursuant to clause (b) of the definition 110
of such term, such certificate to have attached thereto a replacement Schedule 3.12 reflecting the information contained in such certificate (which shall replace in its entirety Schedule 3.12 as originally attached hereto and a copy of which shall be distributed to each Lender by the Administrative Agent promptly after receipt thereof), (ii) cause all outstanding Equity Interests in each Material Foreign Subsidiary directly owned by or on behalf of any Domestic Credit Party or any Foreign Credit Party, to the extent that such Equity Interests have not been pledged pursuant to Section 5.13(a) and to the extent required by the relevant Security Document, to be pledged pursuant to the relevant Security Document (except that (x) no more than 65% of the outstanding voting Equity Interests in any Material Foreign Subsidiary that is a corporation for United States Federal income tax purposes shall be pledged to secure the obligations of Xerox or any Domestic Subsidiary (either directly or through any entity that is a disregarded entity for such purposes) and (y) no Foreign Credit Party shall be required to pledge Equity Interests in any Person other than Material Foreign Subsidiaries directly owned by it and organized under the laws of the same country as such Credit Party (or any state, province or other political subdivision thereof)) and deliver or cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent all certificates or other instruments representing such Equity Interests, together with stock powers or other instruments of transfer with respect thereto endorsed in blank and (iii) cause each Wholly-Owned Material Canadian Subsidiary to deliver a duly executed supplement to the Canadian Security Documents (to the extent that such Subsidiary is not already a party to any Canadian Security Document), in the form specified therein, to the Administrative Agent, whereupon such Subsidiary will become a "Canadian Guarantor" and, from time to time, a "Lien Grantor" for purposes of the Loan Documents to the extent that such Subsidiary is not prohibited by Applicable Law or legally valid contractual restrictions in effect on the date hereof or otherwise permitted by Section 6.10 (or, in the case of a Finance SPE, legally valid and customary contractual restrictions or other legally valid contractual restrictions entered into in connection with the Third Party Vendor Financing Program) from guaranteeing XCD's obligations hereunder and, from time to time and pursuant to the relevant Canadian Security Document, securing such guarantee, provided that the Agents may agree in their discretion, with respect to any pledge of the Equity Interests in any Material Foreign Subsidiary described in Section 5.13(b)(ii) or required as part of satisfying this Section 5.13(b)(iii), that the pledge of such Equity Interests is impossible, impractical or unreasonably burdensome or expensive (or has been substantially, but not fully, completed) and the Agents may, in their respective good faith discretion, consent to a waiver of the pledge of any such Equity Interests. In acting pursuant to the foregoing proviso, each Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of Article 8 of this Agreement, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lenders hereby authorize the Agents, in their sole discretion and from time to time, to grant such waivers and hereby confirm and agree, without limiting the generality of Article 8 of this Agreement, that in the absence of gross 111
negligence or willful misconduct, no Agent shall be liable to any Lender on account of granting any such waiver and any consequences thereof. Section 5.14. Further Assurances. (a) Xerox will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver such Security Documents to the Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request with respect to any additional Overseas Borrower designated as such pursuant to Section 2.19 after the date hereof promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after such designation, in order to provide comparable guarantee and security arrangements for the obligations of such Overseas Borrower as are provided (or required to be provided) for XCE and XCD. (b) Each Credit Party will execute and deliver any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other documents), that may be required under any Applicable Law, or that the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may reasonably request, to cause the Transaction Liens to constitute valid and perfected first priority Liens (subject to Liens permitted by Section 6.02) on the Collateral, all at the relevant Borrower or Borrowers' expense. Xerox will provide to the Administrative Agent, from time to time upon reasonable request, evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as to the perfection and priority of the Transaction Liens created or intended to be created by the Security Documents. (c) If any Domestic Credit Party acquires any real property having, at the time of acquisition thereof, a fair market value of at least $25,000,000, Xerox will notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereof promptly (but in any event within 20 Business Days of the occurrence of such event) and if requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, will cause such real property (unless (i) a Financial Officer certifies that such real property is intended to be the subject of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction or the incurrence of Purchase Money Debt within 270 days, and such transaction is, in fact, consummated within 270 days or (ii) the granting of a Transaction Lien on such real property would violate Applicable Law or any contract existing on the date hereof or otherwise permitted by Section 6.10) to be subjected to a Transaction Lien securing the Secured Obligations and will take, or cause the relevant Guarantor to take, such actions as shall be necessary or reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to grant and perfect or record such Transaction Lien, including actions described in Section 5.14(b), all at such Credit Party's expense. Section 5.15. Ownership of Overseas Borrowers. Xerox will, at all times, own, directly or indirectly, 100% of the Equity Interests of each Overseas Borrower, except, in the event that XCI or any of its subsidiaries is designated an 112
Overseas Borrower, it shall be sufficient for Xerox to own 97% or more of the Equity Interests of XCI or such subsidiary.

(g) any non-payment default under any agreement governing any Material Debt occurs that results in Material Debt becoming due before its scheduled maturity or that enables or permits (without the giving of notice or the lapse of time or any such notice having been given or any such grace period having expired) the holder or holders of Material Debt or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf to cause Material Debt to become due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance thereof, before its scheduled maturity; provided that this Section 7.01(g) shall not apply to secured Debt that becomes due as a result of a voluntary sale or transfer of the property securing such Debt or as a result of a Restatement Event; (h) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation, reorganization or other relief in respect of Xerox or any Material Subsidiary or its debts, or of a substantial part of its assets, under any Federal, state, provincial or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, manager, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for Xerox or any Material Subsidiary or for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any such case, such proceeding or petition shall continue undismissed for 60 days or an order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered; (i) Xerox or any Material Subsidiary shall (i) voluntarily commence any proceeding or file any petition seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief under any Federal, state, provincial or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, (ii) consent to the institution of, or fail to contest in a timely and appropriate manner, any proceeding or petition described in Section 7.01(h) above, (iii) apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, manager, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for Xerox or any Material Subsidiary or for a substantial part of its assets, (iv) file an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against it in any such proceeding, (v) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or (vi) take any action for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; (j) Xerox or any Material Subsidiary shall become unable, admit in writing its inability or fail generally to pay its debts as they become due; (k) one or more judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount exceeding $25,000,000 shall be rendered against one or more Xerox Companies and shall remain undischarged for a period of 45 consecutive days during which execution shall not be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally taken by a judgment creditor to attach or levy upon any asset of any Xerox Company to enforce any such judgment; 133
(l) an ERISA Event or Canadian Funding Failure shall have occurred (other than in respect of a Disclosed Matter) that, in the opinion of the Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events and Canadian Funding Failures that have occurred, could reasonably be expected to result in liability of Xerox and its Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount exceeding $25,000,000 in any year; (m) any Lien purported to be created under any Security Document shall cease to be a valid and perfected Lien on any material Collateral, or any Lien purported to be created under any Security Document shall be asserted by any Credit Party not to be a valid and perfected Lien on any Collateral, with the priority required by the applicable Security Document, except (i) as a result of a Transfer of the applicable Collateral in a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents or other release provided for in the Loan Documents, (ii) as a result of the Administrative Agent's failure to maintain possession of any stock certificates, promissory notes or other documents delivered to it under the relevant Security Document or (iii) correctable errors of any copyright office or the Patent and Trademark Office or any Credit Party with respect to Intellectual Property filings, to the extent the relevant Credit Party promptly causes such error to be corrected; or (n) any Guarantor's CA Guarantee shall at any time fail to constitute a valid and binding agreement of such Guarantor or any party shall so assert in writing (other than as a result of transactions permitted by the Loan Documents); then, and in every such event (except an event with respect to any Borrower described in Section 7.01(h) or 7.01(i) above), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders (or, with respect only to clause (i) below, at the request of the Required Revolving Lenders) shall, by notice to Xerox, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Revolving Commitments, and thereupon the Revolving Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are waived by the Borrower; and in the case of any event with respect to any Borrower described in Section 7.01(h) or 7.01(i) above, the Revolving Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued 134
hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are waived by the Borrowers. ARTICLE 8 The Administrative Agent Section 8.01. Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender Party irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its contractual representative and authorizes the Administrative Agent (a) to sign and deliver the Security Documents and (b) to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. In its capacity as the Lenders' contractual representative, the Administrative Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within the meaning of the term "secured party" as defined in the UCC and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives. For greater certainty, and without limiting the powers of the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any of Loan Documents, each Lender hereby acknowledges that the Administrative Agent shall, for purposes of holding any Liens granted by any Canadian Credit Party on the Collateral pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec to secure payment of all liabilities, obligations and indebtedness of the Canadian Credit Parties to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent including, but not limited to, any bonds, notes or other titles of indebtedness, be the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney or fonde de pouvoir (within the meaning of the Civil Code of Quebec) for all present and future Lenders who will agree to an assignment of participation at the time of such assignment, and in particular for all present and future holders of such bonds, notes, or other titles of indebtedness. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 32 of An Act Respecting Powers of Legal Persons (Quebec) (formerly the Special Corporate Powers Act (Quebec)), the Administrative Agent may acquire and be the holder of such bonds, notes or other titles of indebtedness. The Borrowers hereby acknowledges that each Note issued by it under this Agreement constitutes a title of indebtedness, as such term is used in Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec. Section 8.02. Rights and Powers as a Lender. A bank serving as the Administrative Agent shall, in its capacity as a Lender, have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent. Such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, 135
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other business transaction with any Xerox Company or Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent. Section 8.03. General Immunity. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, sub-agents or employees shall be liable to Xerox or any other Borrower, the Lenders or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, except to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person. Section 8.04. Limited Duties and Responsibilities. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required in writing to exercise by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), provided that the Administrative Agent is indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking, or continuing to take any such action, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for any failure to disclose, any information relating to any Xerox Company that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02). The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof specifying that it is a "notice of default" is given to the Administrative Agent by Xerox or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document including, without limitation, any agreement by a Xerox Company to furnish information directly to each Lender, (iv) the validity, 136
enforceability, sufficiency, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any collateral security, (vi) the financial condition of any Xerox Company or (vii) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. Section 8.05. Authority to Rely on Certain Writings, Statements and Advice. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and shall not incur any liability for relying on, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely on any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Xerox Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Section 8.06. Sub-Agents and Related Parties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through one or more sub-agents appointed by it. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding Sections of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Section 8.07. Resignation; Successor Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 8.07, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the LC Issuing Banks and Xerox. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with Xerox, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the LC Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent. Upon acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a 137
successor Administrative Agent shall be the same (without duplication) as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed by the Borrowers and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. Section 7.8. Credit Decisions by Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance on the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance on the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based on this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. ARTICLE 8 Miscellaneous Section 9.01. Notices. (a) Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone or electronic mail, all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows: (i) if to any Borrower, to Xerox at 800 Long Ridge Road, Stamford, CT 06904, Attention of Treasury Department (Telecopy No. 203-968-4373), with a copy to General Counsel (Telecopy No. 203-968-3446); (ii) if to the Administrative Agent (including in its capacity as a Lender or LC Issuing Bank), to Bank One, NA, 1 Bank One Plaza, Chicago, Illinois, 60670, Attention of Thomas T. Bower (Telecopy No. 312-732-1775); and (iii) if to any other Lender (including in its capacity as an LC Issuing Bank), to it at its address (or telecopy number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire. 138
The electronic mail address for the Administrative Agent is thomas_t_bower@bankone.com and for each other Lender is as set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire. Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number (and, for permitted purposes, its electronic mail address) for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the Administrative Agent and Xerox. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt. (b) Each Overseas Borrower hereby designates Xerox as its representative and agent on its behalf for the purposes of giving and receiving all notices (other than Borrowing Requests and requests for the issuance of Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.04) and any other documentation required to be delivered to it pursuant to this Agreement and any other Loan Document by the Administrative Agent or any Lender. Xerox hereby accepts such appointment. The Agents and the Lenders may regard any notice (other than Borrowing Requests and requests for the issuance of Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.04) or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document from Xerox as a notice or communication from all Borrowers, and may give any notice or communication required or permitted to be given to any Overseas Borrower or Overseas Borrowers hereunder to Xerox on behalf of such Overseas Borrower or Overseas Borrowers. Each Overseas Borrower agrees that each notice, election, representation and warranty, covenant, agreement and undertaking made on its behalf by Xerox shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made by such Overseas Borrower and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Overseas Borrower to the same extent as if the same had been made directly by such Overseas Borrower. Section 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by any Lender Party in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Lender Parties under the Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 9.02(b) - 9.02(k), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the making of a Loan nor the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of Credit shall be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Lender Party had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. 139
(b) No Loan Document or provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except by an agreement in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the LC Issuing Banks are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent or the LC Issuing Banks, as the case may be) and the Borrowers (except, in each case, as expressly provided in the Loan Documents). Additionally, no waiver, amendment, or modification set forth in Section 9.02(c) - 9.02(k) below will be effective without, in addition, the signatures of the Persons required therein. (c) Actions Requiring a Unanimous Lender Vote. Without the written consent of each Lender, no amendment, waiver or modification of any Loan Document will be effective to do any of the following: (i) change the percentage of the Lender Shares or the percentage of any of the Revolving Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Lenders, which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under any Loan Document; (ii) reduce the amount of or postpone the date of the Initial Paydown or the restructuring fee payable pursuant to Section 2.11(b); (iii) amend this Section 9.02; (iv) change the definition of "Lender Share" or "Required Lenders"; or (v) change Section 2.17(b) or Section 2.17(c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby. (d) Actions Requiring a Unanimous Tranche A Lender Vote. Without the written consent of each Tranche A Lender, no amendment, waiver or modification of any Loan Document will be effective to reduce the principal amount of any Tranche A Loan or reduce the interest rate thereon, postpone the Tranche A Maturity Date, or any scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Tranche A Loan under Section 2.09, or any date for the payment of any interest or fee payable with respect to the Tranche A Loans hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment or change the definition of "Required A Lenders" or "Required A/B Lenders". (e) Actions Requiring a Unanimous Tranche B Lender Vote. Without the written consent of each Tranche B Lender, no amendment, waiver or modification of any Loan Document will be effective to reduce the principal amount of any Tranche B Loan or reduce the interest rate thereon, postpone the 140
the Tranche B Maturity Date, or any scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Tranche B Loan under Section 2.09, or any date for the payment of any interest or fee payable with respect to the Tranche B Loans hereunder (including the prepayment premium pursuant to Section 2.10(d)), or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment or change the definition of "Required B Lenders", "Required A/B Lenders" or "Required Revolving /B Lenders". (f) Actions Requiring a Unanimous Tranche C Lender Vote. Without the written consent of each Tranche C Lender, no amendment, waiver or modification of any Loan Document will be effective to reduce the principal amount of any Tranche C Loan or reduce the interest rate thereon, postpone the Tranche C Maturity Date, or any scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Tranche C Loan under Section 2.09, or any date for the payment of any interest or fee payable with respect to the Tranche C Loans hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment or change the definition of "Required C Lenders". (g) Actions Requiring a Unanimous Revolving Lender Vote. Without the written consent of each Revolving Lender, no amendment, waiver or modification of any Loan Document will be effective to increase the Revolving Commitments, reduce the principal amount of any Revolving Loan or reduce the interest rate thereon, postpone the Revolving Maturity Date, or any scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Revolving Loan under Section 2.09, or any date for the payment of any interest or fee payable with respect to the Revolving Loans hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Revolving Commitment or change the definition of "Required Revolving Lenders" or "Required Revolving /B Lenders". (h) Actions Requiring Required Revolving Lender Vote. If at any time a Default shall have occurred and be continuing or the conditions in Section 4.02(a) could not be satisfied, neither any waiver of such Default or such conditions in Section 4.02(a), nor any amendment or other modification of any Loan Document that has the effect of eliminating such Default or enabling such conditions to be satisfied, shall be effective for purposes of Section 4.02 without the written consent to such waiver, amendment or other modification of the Required Revolving Lenders, provided that the foregoing limit on effectiveness shall not apply in the case of the making of any Loan or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect thereto and any concurrent transaction, the aggregate Revolving Exposures of the Revolving Lenders are not increased. 141
(i) Amendments to Mandatory Prepayment Provisions. (i) Without the written consent of (A) until such time as the Tranche C Loans are paid in full, the Required Tranche C Lenders, (B) thereafter, until such time as the Tranche A Loans are paid in full, the Required Tranche A Lenders and (C) thereafter, the Required Revolving/B Lenders, no amendment, waiver or modification of any Loan Document will be effective to reduce the principal amount of or postpone the date of any mandatory prepayment from the proceeds of Asset Transfers or Casualty Events pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(i) or 2.10(b)(iii). (ii) Without the written consent of (A) until such time as the Tranche C Loans are paid in full, the Required Tranche C Lenders, (B) thereafter, until such time as the Tranche A Loans and the Tranche B Loans are paid in full, the Required A/B Lenders and (C) thereafter, the Required Revolving Lenders, no amendment, waiver or modification of any Loan Document will be effective to reduce the principal amount of or postpone the date of any mandatory prepayment from the proceeds of Capital Markets Debt or Equity Issuances pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(ii)). (j) Amendments Releasing Guarantees or Collateral. (i) Without the written consent of each Tranche B Lender, and, if the amount of the aggregate outstanding Tranche B Loans is less than 25% of the Basket Lien Principal Amount, each Tranche A Lender and Revolving Lender, no amendment, waiver or modification of any Loan Document will be effective to release all or any substantial portion of the Domestic Collateral (except as expressly provided in Section 9.03 or in the relevant Security Document). (ii) Without the written consent of each Revolving Lender, no amendment, waiver or modification of any Loan Document will be effective to release all or any substantial portion of the Foreign Collateral, or to release Xerox's Guarantee of the obligations of the Overseas Borrowers (except as expressly provided in Section 9.03 or in the relevant Security Document). (k) Actions Requiring Super-Majority Lender Vote. Without the written consent of the Super-Majority Lenders, neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document may be amended to permit any Debt (including any Debt attributable to an increase in the Revolving Commitments or the addition of any tranche of Loans hereunder) to be secured by any Collateral pursuant to a Lien of equal priority to, or higher priority than, the Lien of the Secured Parties thereon, except for Permitted Liens. 142
Section 9.03. Automatic Releases. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the Transfer of any Collateral by any Credit Party, the Lender Parties hereby agree that the security interest granted in such Collateral shall immediately and automatically terminate and all rights to such Collateral shall automatically revert to such Credit Party without any further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any other Person. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, in the event (i) all of the Equity Interests in any Guarantor shall be sold or otherwise disposed of (including by merger or consolidation) in a sale permitted by this Agreement or a Guarantor shall liquidate or dissolve in a transaction permitted by this Agreement, (ii) any Guarantor becomes a Turnaround Program Subsidiary or ceases to be a Subsidiary in accordance with Section 6.05(d), (iii) with respect to any Foreign Guarantor or Overseas Borrower, all of the Release Conditions with respect to such Foreign Guarantor or Overseas Borrower have been satisfied or (iv) with respect to Xerox or any Domestic Guarantor, all of the Release Conditions are satisfied, then, in each case, the obligations of such Guarantor or Borrower (as the case may be) hereunder and pursuant to any Loan Document shall automatically be discharged and released, and all rights to or security interests in the Collateral of such Guarantor or Borrower (as the case may be) in favor of the Secured Parties shall revert to the applicable Guarantor or Borrower or be released, as the case may be, in each case without any further action by any Secured Party or any other Person. If at any time any payment of a Secured Obligation is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency or receivership of Xerox, any Overseas Borrower or otherwise, any Guarantee or Guarantees in respect of such Secured Obligation that have been discharged and released pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(iii) or 9.03(b)(iv) shall be reinstated with respect thereto as though such payment had been due but not made at such time. (c) Upon any termination or release of obligations or Collateral pursuant to this Section 9.03, the Collateral Agent will, at the expense of the relevant Credit Party, execute and deliver to such Credit Party such documents as such Credit Party shall reasonably request to evidence the termination or release of such obligations or Collateral, as the case may be.

security interests in the Collateral of such Guarantor in favor of the Secured Parties shall revert to the applicable Guarantor or be released, as the case may be, without any further action by any Secured Party or any other Person. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if any Immaterial Subsidiary Certificate indicates that any Foreign Subsidiary the Equity Interests of which have been pledged to the Collateral Agent as part of the Collateral is not a Material Foreign Subsidiary for purposes of clause (a) of such definition as of the date of delivery of such certificate and Xerox has notified the Administrative Agent in writing that it requests that the Equity Interests of such Foreign Subsidiary be released, then the pledge of the Equity Interests in such Foreign Subsidiary shall automatically be discharged and released, and all rights to such Equity Interests in favor of the Secured Parties shall revert to the applicable Guarantor without any further action by any Secured Party or any other Person, and the Collateral Agent shall return any certificates evidencing such Equity Interests to the applicable Guarantor. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if any Subsidiary the Equity Interests of which have been pledged to the Collateral Agent as part of the Collateral becomes a Qualified Turnaround Program Subsidiary with respect to which the Qualification Requirements have been satisfied with respect to a prohibition on the pledge of the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary to the Collateral Agent as part of the Collateral thereto, then the pledge of the Equity Interests in such Subsidiary shall automatically be discharged and released, and all rights to such Equity Interests in favor of the Secured Parties shall revert to the applicable Guarantor without any further action by any Secured Party or any other Person, and the Collateral Agent shall return any certificates evidencing such Equity Interests to the applicable Guarantor. Section 9.04. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) Each of the Borrowers, with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries, shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of external counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan Documents and any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the LC Issuing Banks in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) at any time when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Lender Party, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel (including internal counsel) for any Lender Party, 144

(b) Each of the Borrowers, with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries, shall indemnify each of the Lender Parties and their respective Related Parties (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom or any Letter of Credit or the use thereof (including any refusal by any LC Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any Mortgaged Property or any other property owned or operated by any Xerox Company, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to any Xerox Company, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not be available to any Indemnitee to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from such Indemnitee's gross negligence or wilful misconduct. (c) To the extent that any Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or any LC Issuing Bank under Section 9.04(a) or 9.04(b), each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or the relevant LC Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or such LC Issuing Bank in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based on its share of the sum of the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and unused Revolving Commitments at the time. 145
(d) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, no Borrower shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. (e) All amounts due under this Section 9.04 shall be payable within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor. (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.04 shall require a payment by a Foreign Credit Party if such payment would violate Applicable Law or if Applicable Law would require minority shareholder approval, a valuation or a discretionary order; provided that Xerox, as a Guarantor under this Agreement, shall be liable for any such payment referred to in this Subsection 9.04(f). Section 9.05. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any LC Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (except the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any LC Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly provided herein, the Related Parties of the Lender Parties) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of any Revolving Commitment it has at the time and any Loans at the time owing to it); provided that: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate that does not involve a new Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Revolving Commitment or any Lender's obligations in respect of its LC Exposure, each LC Issuing Bank) must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, it being understood that, in the case of any assignment involving a new 146
Revolving Lender, the assignee may be required to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent its legal and financial ability to timely perform its obligations in respect of its unused Revolving Commitment); (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that this clause (B) shall not prohibit the assignment of all or a portion of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Loans or the Revolving Commitments on a non-pro rata basis; (C) unless each of Xerox and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, the amount of the Revolving Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date on which the relevant Assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 or, if only Tranche B Term Loans are being assigned, shall not be less than $1,000,000; provided that this clause (C) shall not apply to an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Revolving Commitment or Loans or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Loans or the Revolving Commitments; (D) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided that only one such fee shall be due in respect of a simultaneous assignment to up to five Lender Affiliates; and (E) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a completed Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to Section 9.05(d), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.04). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.05(b) shall be treated for 147
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.05(e). (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, their respective Revolving Commitments and the principal amounts of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be prima facie evidence of the information recorded therein, and the parties hereto may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by any party hereto at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 9.05(b) and any written consent to such assignment required by Section 9.05(b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this Section 9.05(d). Promptly after recording any Assignment, the Administrative Agent shall send Xerox a notice of such Assignment, including the pertinent information therein and, if the assignee is not already a Lender, accompanied by a copy of the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire. (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower or any other Lender Party, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers and the other Lender Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment or modification that both affects such 148
Participant and requires the unanimous vote of all Lenders or the unanimous vote of the Lenders in the Class of Loans or the Revolving Commitments in which the Participant has acquired an interest. Subject to Section 9.05(f), each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 9.05(b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.09 as though it were a Lender, provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender. (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Xerox's prior written consent. Without limiting the preceding sentence, a Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall only be entitled to any of the benefits of Section 2.16 if Xerox is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Sections 2.16(e) and 2.16(g) as though it were a Lender. (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or, in the case of a Lender which is a fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee, and this Section 9.05 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. Section 9.06. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties in the Loan Documents and in certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that any Lender Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any principal of or accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable hereunder is outstanding or any Letter of Credit is outstanding or any Revolving Commitment has not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 9.04 and 9.13 149
and Article 8 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the Transactions, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Revolving Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. Section 9.07. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuing Banks and the Arrangers constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement (a) will become effective as provided in Section 4.01 and (b) thereafter will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Section 9.08. Severability. If any provision of any Loan Document is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent (but only to the extent) of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, (b) the other provisions of the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the intentions of the parties thereto as nearly as may be possible and (c) the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any such provision in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Section 9.09. Right of Setoff. If an acceleration or payment Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower (or, in the case of any Overseas Borrower, Xerox, as Guarantor) against any obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing hereunder and held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section 9.09 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender may have. 150
Section 9.10. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. (b) Each of the Borrowers irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any relevant appellate court, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and, except to the extent expressly provided therein, any other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each party hereto agrees that, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in any Loan Document shall affect any right that any Lender Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to any Loan Document against any Credit Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. (c) Each of the Borrowers irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document in any court referred to in Section 9.10(b). Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court. (d) Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in any Loan Document will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. Section 9.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO 151
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from any Xerox Company relating to its business, other than any such information that is available to any Lender Party on a nonconfidential basis before disclosure by Xerox. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 9.13 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Section 9.14. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together 152
with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under Applicable Law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") that may be contracted for, charged or otherwise received by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with Applicable Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section 9.14 shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such Lender shall have received such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of payment. 153

(d) The Security Interests are granted as security only and shall not subject the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party to, or transfer or in any way affect or modify, any obligation or liability of any Lien Grantor with respect to any of the Collateral or any transaction in connection therewith. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, Liens on Restricted Collateral granted pursuant to this Agreement and the other Domestic Security Documents will only secure, at any time, an amount of the Secured Obligations not to exceed the Basket Lien Available Amount at such time. (f) It is the intention of the parties that the Liens granted pursuant to this Agreement and the other Domestic Security Documents shall comply with (i) Section 6.4 of the ESOP Guarantee Agreement and (ii) Section 20.8 of each of the XCFI Indentures. Section 5. Further Assurances; Covenants. Each Lien Grantor covenants as follows: (a) Such Lien Grantor will not (i) change its corporate, partnership, company or other legal name or location (determined as provided in UCC Section 9-307), (ii) change its identity or corporate structure, (iii) change its Federal Taxpayer Identification Number or (iv) become bound, as provided in UCC Section 9-203(d) or otherwise, by a security agreement entered into by another Person, except, if applicable, in accordance with Section 5.03(a) of the Credit Agreement. 22
(b) Such Lien Grantor will, from time to time, at its expense, execute, deliver, file and record any statement, assignment, instrument, document, agreement or other paper and take any other reasonable action (including, without limitation, any filings of financing or continuation statements under the UCC) that from time to time is required under the UCC or with respect to Recordable Intellectual Property to enable the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties to obtain the full benefits of the Domestic Security Documents or to enable the Collateral Agent to exercise and enforce any of its rights, powers and remedies under the Domestic Security Documents with respect to any of the Collateral. The Lien Grantor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to file a Record or Records (as defined in the UCC), including, without limitation, financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, in all jurisdictions and with all filing offices as the Collateral Agent may determine, in its sole discretion, are necessary or advisable to perfect the security interest granted to the Collateral Agent herein without such Lien Grantor's signature appearing thereon. Such financing statements may describe the Collateral in the same manner as described herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral that describes such property in any other manner as the Collateral Agent may determine, in its sole discretion, is necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of the security interest in the Collateral granted to the Collateral Agent herein, including, without limitation, describing such property as "all assets" or "all personal property." Such Lien Grantor agrees that a carbon, photographic, photostatic or other reproduction of this Agreement is sufficient as a financing statement. Such Lien Grantor constitutes the Collateral Agent its attorney-in-fact to execute and file any filings required or so requested for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed; and such power, being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable until all the Security Interests granted by such Lien Grantor terminate pursuant to Section 19. Such Lien Grantor shall pay the costs of, or reasonable costs incidental to, any recording or filing of any financing or continuation statements or other documents recorded or filed pursuant thereto concerning the Collateral. (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, if any Collateral is in the possession or control of a warehouseman, bailee or agent, such Lien Grantor will upon request of the Required Lenders (i) notify such warehouseman, bailee or agent of the relevant Security Interests, (ii) instruct such warehouseman, bailee or agent to hold all such Collateral for the Collateral Agent's account subject to the Collateral Agent's instructions and to permit such Collateral to be removed by such Lien Grantor in the ordinary course of business until the Collateral Agent notifies such warehouseman, bailee or agent that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (iii) use reasonable commercial efforts (without incurring material obligations or foregoing material rights) to cause such warehouseman, bailee or agent to Authenticate a Record 23
acknowledging that it holds possession of such Collateral for the Collateral Agent's benefit and (iv) make such Authenticated Record available to the Collateral Agent. (d) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Lien Grantor shall stamp or otherwise mark all books and records relating to the Collateral in such manner, if any, as the Required Lenders may reasonably require in order to reflect the Security Interests. (e) Such Lien Grantor will, promptly upon request, provide to the Collateral Agent all information and evidence in such Lien Grantor's possession, or under such Lien Grantor's control, or that can be generated internally or, if an Actionable Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, can otherwise be obtained by such Lien Grantor, without unreasonable effort or expense, which the Collateral Agent may reasonably request concerning the Collateral to enable the Collateral Agent to enforce the provisions of the Domestic Security Documents. (f) Such Lien Grantor will not Transfer, grant interests in, or grant any option with respect to, any of its Collateral; provided that such Lien Grantor may do any of the foregoing unless doing so would violate a covenant in the Credit Agreement. Concurrently with any such Transfer (except a Transfer to another Lien Grantor, a lease or a license) permitted by the foregoing proviso, the Security Interests on such assets Transferred (but not in any Proceeds arising from such Transfer) will cease immediately pursuant to Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement. Section 6. Recordable Intellectual Property. Each Lien Grantor covenants as follows: (a) On the Effective Date (in the case of an Original Lien Grantor) or the date on which it signs and delivers its first Security Agreement Supplement (in the case of any other Lien Grantor), such Lien Grantor will sign and deliver to the Collateral Agent Intellectual Property Security Agreements with respect to all Recordable Intellectual Property then owned by it. Within 60 days after each March 31 and September 30 after December 31, 2002, it will sign and deliver to the Collateral Agent any Intellectual Property Security Agreement necessary to grant Security Interests on all Recordable Intellectual Property owned by it on such March 31 or September 30 that is not covered by any previous Intellectual Property Security Agreement so signed and delivered by it. In each case, it will promptly make all Intellectual Property Filings necessary to record the Security Interests on such Recordable Intellectual Property; provided, however, that any good faith omission to include any Recordable Intellectual Property in any such Intellectual Property Security Agreement shall not constitute an Event of Default if, within 15 days after the discovery by such Lien Grantor of such good faith 24
omission, such Lien Grantor signs and delivers to the Collateral Agent Intellectual Property Security Agreements with respect to such omitted Recordable Intellectual Property and promptly makes all Intellectual Property Fillings necessary to record the Security Interests on such omitted Recordable Intellectual Property. (b) Such Lien Grantor will notify the Collateral Agent promptly if it knows that any application or registration relating to any material Recordable Intellectual Property owned or licensed by it may become abandoned or dedicated to the public, or of any adverse determination or development (including the institution of, or any adverse determination or development in, any proceeding in the United States Copyright Office, the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any court) regarding such Lien Grantor's ownership of such material Recordable Intellectual Property, its right to register or patent the same, or its right to keep and maintain the same, except where the occurrence of any of the foregoing could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. If any of such Lien Grantor's rights to any material Recordable Intellectual Property are infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third party, such Lien Grantor will, unless such Lien Grantor shall reasonably determine that such action would be of negligible value, economic or otherwise, or the failure to take such action could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) promptly sue for infringement, misappropriation or dilution and to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution, (ii) take such other actions as such Lien Grantor shall reasonably deem appropriate under the circumstances to protect such material Recordable Intellectual Property and (iii) notify the Collateral Agent thereof to the extent required by the Credit Agreement. Unless an Actionable Event of Default shall exist and the Collateral Agent shall have notified such Lien Grantor that the Lien Grantor's right to do so is terminated, suspended or otherwise limited, the grant of Liens on Recordable Intellectual Property pursuant hereto and the Intellectual Property Security Agreements shall not preclude any Lien Grantor from entering into any Copyright License, Patent License or Trademark License or, subject to Section 5, from managing or maintaining its Recordable Intellectual Property in a manner that is in the ordinary course of such Lien Grantor's business and consistent with such Lien Grantor's historical practices as permitted by the Credit Agreement. Section 7. Pledged Securities. Each Lien Grantor represents, warrants and covenants as follows: (a) Certificated Securities. (i) With respect to each Original Lien Grantor, such Original Lien Grantor will deliver, (A) on the Effective Date, to the Collateral Agent as Collateral hereunder all certificates representing Pledged 25

(ii) With respect to any other Lien Grantor, such Lien Grantor will deliver, on the date on which it signs and delivers its first Security Agreement Supplement or, in the case of Pledged Certificated Securities that are Equity Interests in any Foreign Subsidiary, as promptly as practicable, to the Collateral Agent as Collateral hereunder all certificates representing Pledged Certificated Securities that are Equity Interests then directly owned by such Lien Grantor and required to be included in the Collateral. (iii) After the pledge and delivery of Pledged Certificated Securities described in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7(a), whenever such Original Lien Grantor or such Lien Grantor, as the case may be, acquires any other certificate representing a Pledged Certificated Security that are Equity Interests and required to be included in the Collateral, such Original Lien Grantor or such Lien Grantor, as the case may be, will promptly deliver such certificate to the Collateral Agent as Collateral hereunder. The provisions of this subsection are subject to the limitation in Section 7(g) in the case of Securities that are voting Equity Interests in a Foreign Subsidiary and to the limitation in Section 7(h) in the case of Equity Interests that are subject to Permitted Encumbrances. (b) Uncertificated Securities.

(ii) With respect to any other Lien Grantor, such Lien Grantor will, on the date on which it signs and delivers its first Security Agreement Supplement or, in the case of Pledged Uncertificated Securities that are Equity Interests in any Foreign Subsidiary, as promptly as practicable, in respect of each Pledged Uncertificated Security that is an Equity Interest then directly owned by such Lien Grantor and required to be included in the Collateral, cause the issuer of any such Pledged Uncertificated Security to either (x) register the Collateral Agent as the registered owner of such security on the books and records of the issuer or (y) enter into an Issuer Control Agreement with respect to such Security, in each case as the Collateral Agent and such Lien Grantor may reasonably agree. (iii) After the pledge of Pledged Uncertificated Securities described in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7(b), whenever such Original Lien Grantor or such Lien Grantor, as the case may be, acquires any other Pledged Uncertificated Security that is an Equity Interest and required to be included in the Collateral, such Original Lien Grantor or such Lien Grantor, as the case may be, will promptly cause the issuer of any such Pledged Uncertificated Security to either (x) register the Collateral Agent as the registered owner of such security on the books and records of the issuer or (y) enter into an Issuer Control Agreement with respect to such Security, in each case as the Collateral Agent and such Original Lien Grantor or such Lien Grantor, as the case may be, may reasonably agree. The provisions of this subsection are subject to (X) the limitation in Section 7(g) in the case of Securities that are voting Equity Interests in a Foreign 27
Subsidiary, (Y) Section 9(c) and (Z) the limitation in Section 7(h) in the case of Equity Interests that are subject to Permitted Encumbrances. (c) Perfection as to Certificated Securities. When such Lien Grantor delivers the certificate representing any Pledged Certificated Security that is an Equity Interest and owned by it to the Collateral Agent and complies with Section 7(e) in connection with such delivery, (i) the Security Interest on such Pledged Certificated Security will be perfected under the UCC, subject to no prior Liens or rights of others, (ii) the Collateral Agent will have Control of such Pledged Certificated Security and (iii) the Collateral Agent will be a protected purchaser (within the meaning of UCC Section 8-303) thereof if the Collateral Agent does not have notice of any adverse claim to the applicable security. (d) Perfection as to Uncertificated Securities. When such Lien Grantor, the Collateral Agent and the issuer of any Pledged Uncertificated Security that is an Equity Interest and owned by such Lien Grantor enter into an Issuer Control Agreement with respect thereto, or when the Collateral Agent is registered as the registered owner of such Pledged Uncertificated Security, (i) the Security Interest on such Pledged Uncertificated Security will be perfected under the UCC, subject to no prior Liens or rights of others, (ii) the Collateral Agent will have Control of such Pledged Uncertificated Security and (iii) the Collateral Agent will be a protected purchaser (within the meaning of UCC Section 8-303) thereof if the Collateral Agent does not have notice of any adverse claim to the applicable security. (e) Delivery of Pledged Certificates. Any certificate representing a Pledged Certificated Security that is an Equity Interest, when delivered to the Collateral Agent, will be in suitable form for transfer by delivery, or accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank signed by a Responsible Officer, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. (f) Communications. If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent shall have given notice to the Lien Grantors that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in Section 12, such Lien Grantor will promptly give to the Collateral Agent copies of any notices and other communications received by it with respect to Pledged Securities that are Equity Interests and registered in the name of such Lien Grantor or its nominee. (g) Foreign Subsidiaries. Such Lien Grantor will not be obligated to comply with the provisions of this Section at any time with respect to any Security that is a voting Equity Interest in a Foreign Subsidiary if and to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Security is excluded from the Collateral at such time pursuant to Section 4(b)(v). 28
(h) Equity Interests Subject to Permitted Encumbrances. Such Lien Grantor will not be obligated to comply with the provisions of this Section at any time with respect to any Equity Interest issued by any Person if and to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Equity Interest is excluded from the Collateral at such time pursuant to Section 4(b)(i). (i) Such Lien Grantor shall hold directly, and not through any subsidiary, Securities Intermediary or other Person, all Pledged Securities owned by it. Section 8. Collateral Account. (a) There is hereby established with the Collateral Agent, with respect to each Lien Grantor, a cash collateral account (its "Collateral Account") in the name and under the exclusive control of the Collateral Agent into which there shall be deposited from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Actionable Event of Default and upon notice from the Collateral Agent that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 8 the cash proceeds of the Collateral required to be delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to subsection 8(b) hereof or any other provision of any Domestic Security Document. Any income received by the Collateral Agent with respect to the balance from time to time standing to the credit of each Collateral Account, including any interest or capital gains on Liquid Investments, shall remain, or be deposited, in the Collateral Account. All cash amounts on deposit in each Collateral Account from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, together with any Liquid Investments from time to time made pursuant to subsection 8(d) hereof, shall at all times be within the exclusive possession, dominion and control of the Collateral Agent, shall constitute part of the Collateral hereunder and shall not constitute payment of the Secured Obligations until applied thereto as hereinafter provided. (b) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and if so requested by the Required Lenders, each Lien Grantor shall instruct all account debtors and other Persons obligated in respect of all Accounts then included in the Collateral to make all payments in respect of the Accounts either (i) directly to the Collateral Agent (by instructing that such payments be remitted to a post office box which shall be in the name of such Lien Grantor (with a notation that proceeds held therein are held in trust for and subject to the Liens of the Secured Parties) and under the control of the Collateral Agent) or (ii) under other arrangements, in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, pursuant to which such Lien Grantor shall have irrevocably instructed such other bank (and such other bank shall have agreed) to remit all proceeds of such payments directly to the Collateral Agent for deposit into the Collateral Account or as the Collateral Agent may otherwise instruct such bank. All such 29
payments made to the Collateral Agent shall be deposited in such Lien Grantor's Collateral Account. In addition to the foregoing, such Lien Grantor agrees that if the proceeds of any Collateral hereunder (including the payments made in respect of Accounts) are received by it at a time when the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(b) are in effect, such Lien Grantor shall as promptly as possible deposit such proceeds into its Collateral Account. Until so deposited into the Collateral Account, all such proceeds shall, during the continuation of such Event of Default, be held in trust by such Lien Grantor for the Secured Parties and shall not be commingled with any other funds or property of such Lien Grantor. (c) Upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall, if so instructed by the Required Lenders, apply or cause to be applied (subject to collection) any or all of the balance from time to time standing to the credit of each Collateral Account in the manner specified in Section 14. (d) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, amounts on deposit in each Collateral Account, to the extent not applied in the manner specified in Section 14 pursuant to paragraph (c) above, shall be invested and re-invested from time to time in such Liquid Investments as the relevant Lien Grantor shall determine, which Liquid Investments shall be held in the name and be under the control of the Collateral Agent, provided that the Collateral Agent shall, if instructed by the Required Lenders, liquidate any such Liquid Investments and apply or cause to be applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Secured Obligations in the manner specified in Section 14; and provided further that the Collateral Agent shall, if so instructed by relevant Lenders in the manner specified in Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement, liquidate any such Liquid Investments and release the proceeds thereof to the relevant Lien Grantor. For this purpose, "Liquid Investments" means Permitted Investments; provided that each Liquid Investment shall mature within 30 days after it is acquired by the Collateral Agent. Section 9. Transfer of Record Ownership. (a) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may (and to the extent that action by it is required, the relevant Lien Grantor, if directed to do so by the Collateral Agent, will as promptly as practicable) cause each of the Pledged Securities (or any portion thereof specified in such direction) to be transferred of record into the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee. (b) Perfection upon Transfer of Record Ownership. If and when any Pledged Security (whether certificated or uncertificated) owned by such Lien Grantor is transferred of record into the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee pursuant to Section 7(b) or 9(a), (i) the Security Interest on such Pledged Security will be perfected, subject to no prior Liens or rights of others, (ii) the 30
Collateral Agent will have Control of such Pledged Security and (iii) the Collateral Agent will be a protected purchaser (within the meaning of UCC Section 8-303) thereof if the Collateral Agent does not have notice of any adverse claim to the applicable security. (c) Provisions Inapplicable after Transfer of Record Ownership. If the provisions of Section 9(a) are implemented, Section 7(b) shall not thereafter apply to any Pledged Security that is registered in the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee. (d) Communications after Transfer of Record Ownership. The Collateral Agent will promptly give to the relevant Lien Grantor copies of any notices and other communications received by the Collateral Agent with respect to Pledged Securities registered in the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee. Section 10. Right to Vote Securities. (a) Unless an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent shall have notified such Lien Grantor that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 10, each Lien Grantor will have the right, from time to time, to vote and to give consents, ratifications and waivers with respect to any Pledged Security owned by it, and the Collateral Agent will, upon receiving a written request from such Lien Grantor, deliver to such Lien Grantor or as specified in such request such proxies, powers of attorney, consents, ratifications and waivers in respect of any such Pledged Security that is registered in the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee, in each case as shall be reasonably requested by such Lien Grantor. Unless an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent shall have notified such Lien Grantor that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 10, the Collateral Agent will have no right to take any action which the owner of a Pledged Partnership Interest or Pledged LLC Interest is entitled to take with respect thereto, except the right to receive payments and other distributions to the extent provided herein. (b) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent shall have notified such Lien Grantor that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 10, the Collateral Agent will have the right to the extent permitted by Applicable Law (and, in the case of Collateral consisting of any Security that is subject to any Permitted Encumbrances, by the relevant agreement or governing document to the extent of any Permitted Encumbrances contained in such agreement or governing document) to vote, to give consents, ratifications and waivers and to take any other action with respect to the Pledged Securities (if any) with the same force and effect as if the Collateral Agent were the absolute and sole owner thereof, and 31
each Lien Grantor will take all such action as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request from time to time to give effect to such right. Section 11. General Authority. Each Lien Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent its true and lawful attorney, with full power of substitution, in the name of such Lien Grantor, the Collateral Agent, the Secured Parties or otherwise, for the use and benefit of the Secured Parties, but at the Borrowers' expense, to the extent permitted by law to exercise, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Actionable Event of Default or upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, all or any of the following powers with respect to all or any of the Collateral: (a) to demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for any and all monies due or to become due thereon or by virtue thereof, (b) to settle, compromise, compound, prosecute or defend any action or proceeding with respect thereto, (c) upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise deal in or with the same or the proceeds thereof, as fully and effectually as if the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner of the Lien Grantor's right, title and interest therein, and (d) to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to make any allowance and other adjustments with reference thereto; provided that, except in the case of Personal Property Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, the Collateral Agent will give the relevant Lien Grantor at least ten days' prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale thereof or the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition thereof will be made. Any such notice shall (i) contain the information specified in UCC Section 9-613, (ii) be Authenticated and (iii) be sent to the parties required to be notified pursuant to UCC Section 9-611(c); provided that, if the Collateral Agent fails to comply with this sentence in any respect, its liability for such failure shall be limited to the liability (if any) imposed on it as a matter of law under the UCC. Section 12. Remedies upon Actionable Event of Default or Acceleration. (a) Upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent may exercise (or cause its sub-agents to exercise) any and all remedies available to it (or to such sub-agents) under the Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, 32
the Collateral Agent may exercise (or cause its sub-agents to exercise) on behalf of the Secured Parties all rights of a secured party after default under the UCC (whether or not in effect in the jurisdiction where such rights are exercised) with respect to any Personal Property Collateral and, in addition, the Collateral Agent may, without being required to give any notice, except as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, (i) withdraw all cash and Liquid Investments in the Collateral Accounts and apply such cash and Liquid Investments and other cash, if any, then held by it as Collateral as specified in Section 14 and (ii) if there shall be no such cash or Liquid Investments or if such cash and Liquid Investments shall be insufficient to pay all the Secured Obligations in full, take possession of, sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, and at such price or prices as the Collateral Agent may deem satisfactory. Any Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral so sold at any public sale (or, if the Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations, at any private sale). The relevant Lien Grantor will execute and deliver such documents and take such other action as the Collateral Agent deems reasonably necessary or proper in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with law. Upon any such sale the Collateral Agent shall have the right to deliver, assign and transfer to the purchaser thereof the Collateral so sold. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold to it absolutely and free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity or right of redemption of the relevant Lien Grantor which may be waived, and such Lien Grantor, to the extent permitted by law, hereby specifically waives all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal which it has or may have under any law now existing or hereafter adopted. The notice (if any) of such sale required by Section 11 shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section 11. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix in the notice of such sale. At any such sale the Collateral may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any such sale pursuant to any such notice. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to which the same may be so adjourned. In the case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until the selling price is paid by the purchaser thereof, but the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in the case of the failure of such purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in the case of any such failure, such Collateral may again be sold upon like notice. The Collateral Agent, instead of exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose 33
the Security Interests and sell the Collateral, or any portion thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent jurisdiction. (b) For the purpose of enforcing any and all rights and remedies under the Security Documents upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Actionable Event of Default or upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, as the case may be, the Collateral Agent may (i) require any Lien Grantor to, and such Lien Grantor agrees that it will, at its expense and upon the request of the Collateral Agent, forthwith take reasonable steps to assemble all or any part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral Agent and make it available at a place designated by the Collateral Agent which is, in its opinion, reasonably convenient to the Collateral Agent and such Lien Grantor, whether at the premises of such Lien Grantor or otherwise, (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, enter, with or without process of law and without breach of the peace, any premise where any of the Collateral is or may be located, and without charge or liability to it seize and remove such Collateral from such premises, (iii) have access to and use such Lien Grantor's books and records relating to the Collateral upon reasonable prior notice and at reasonable times and (iv) prior to the disposition of the Collateral, store or transfer it without charge in or by means of any storage or transportation facility owned or leased by such Lien Grantor, process, repair or recondition it or otherwise prepare it for disposition in any manner and to the extent the Collateral Agent reasonably deems appropriate and, in connection with such preparation and disposition, use without charge any trademark, trade name, copyright, patent or technical process used by such Lien Grantor in connection therewith and included in the Collateral, subject, with respect to products being sold under Trademarks, to standards of quality with respect to such products that are reasonably comparable to those prevailing at the time of such Actionable Event of Default. (c) The remedies specified in this Section 12 do not affect, and are in addition to, remedies otherwise specified for or available to the Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including, but not limited to, remedies available upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or Actionable Event of Default, as the case may be. (d) The Collateral Agent hereby agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the exercise of rights and remedies by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 12 (or otherwise) with respect to any Collateral may be subject to the effect of any Permitted Encumbrances. Section 13. Limitation on Duty of Collateral Agent in Respect of Collateral. Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession or 34
control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income thereon or as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, consignee or other agent or bailee selected by the Collateral Agent in good faith. Section 14. Application of Proceeds.

(x) in the case of proceeds of any sale of, or realization upon, ESOP Restricted Collateral that is not XCFI Restricted Collateral remaining after the application of amounts pursuant to clause first above, in ratable amounts as follows: (I) the ESOP Percentage thereof shall be applied to pay (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section 14(b)) the ESOP Secured Obligations in accordance with Section 14(a)(ii) until payment in full of all ESOP Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for); and (II) the CA Percentage thereof shall be applied to pay (or provide for the repayment thereof pursuant to Section 14(b)) the CA Secured Obligations in accordance with Section 14(a)(iv) until payment in full of all CA Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for); (y) in the case of proceeds of any sale of, or realization upon, XCFI Restricted Collateral that is not ESOP Restricted Collateral remaining after the application of amounts pursuant to clause first above, in ratable amounts as follows: (I) the XCFI Percentage thereof shall be applied to pay (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section 14 (b)) the XCFI Secured Obligations in accordance with Section 14(a)(iii) until payment in full of all XCFI Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for); and (II) the CA Percentage thereof shall be applied to pay (or provide for the repayment thereof pursuant to Section 14(b)) the CA Secured Obligations in accordance with Section 14(a)(iv) until payment in full of all CA Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for); and (z) in the case of proceeds of any sale of, or realization upon, any Collateral that is not Shared Collateral remaining after the application of amounts pursuant to clause first above, 100% thereof shall be applied to pay (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section 14(b)) the CA Secured Obligations in accordance with Section 14(a)(iv) until payment in full of all CA Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for); and finally, to pay to the relevant Lien Grantor, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, any surplus then remaining from the proceeds of the Collateral owned by it. 36
(ii) All amounts required to be applied to pay (or provide for the payment of) the ESOP Secured Obligations pursuant to Section 14(a)(i) shall be applied by the Collateral Agent in the following order of priorities: first, to pay the unpaid principal of the ESOP Secured Obligations ratably (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section 14(b)), until payment in full of the principal of all ESOP Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for); second, to pay ratably all interest on the ESOP Secured Obligations; and third, to pay all other ESOP Secured Obligations ratably (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section 14(b)), until payment in full of all such other ESOP Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for). (iii) All amounts required to be applied to pay (or provide for the payment of) the XCFI Secured Obligations pursuant to Section 14(a)(i) shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Trustee under each of the XCFI Indentures (and any successor Trustee thereunder) for application by such Trustee in accordance with the provisions of each of the XCFI Indentures (or provide for such payment pursuant to Section 14(b)), until payment in full of all XCFI Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for). (iv) All amounts required to be applied to pay (or provide for the payment of) the CA Secured Obligations pursuant to Section 14(a)(i) shall be applied by the Collateral Agent in the following order of priorities: first, to ratably pay any unreimbursed expenses for which any Secured Party is to be reimbursed pursuant to Section 9.04 of the Credit Agreement, and any unpaid fees owing to the Agents under the Credit Agreement; second, to pay the unpaid principal of Tranche B Term Loans (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section 14(b)), until payment in full of the principal of all Tranche B Term Loans shall have been made (or so provided for); third, to pay interest on Tranche B Term Loans, until payment in full of all such interest shall have been made; 37
fourth, to pay ratably the unpaid principal of Revolving Loans, Tranche A Term Loans and, if still outstanding, Tranche C Term Loans (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section ), until payment in full of the principal of such Loans shall have been made (or so provided for); fifth, to pay ratably all interest and fees payable under the Credit Agreement to Revolving Lenders, Tranche A Lenders and, if still outstanding, Tranche C Lenders, until payment in full of all such interest and fees shall have been made; and sixth, to pay all other CA Secured Obligations ratably (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section ), until payment in full of all such other CA Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for). (v) The Collateral Agent may make distributions under clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above in cash or in kind or, on a ratable basis, in any combination thereof. (b) If at any time any portion of any monies collected or received by the Collateral Agent would, but for the provisions of this Section 14(b), be payable in respect of a Contingent CA Secured Obligation or any other Secured Obligation that is not then due and payable (by reason of acceleration or otherwise), the Collateral Agent shall not apply any monies to pay such Secured Obligation but instead shall request the holder thereof, at least 10 days before each proposed distribution hereunder, to notify the Collateral Agent as to the maximum amount of such Secured Obligation if then ascertainable (e.g. in the case of a Letter of Credit, the maximum amount available for subsequent drawings thereunder, regardless of whether the conditions to drawing thereunder are then satisfied). If the holder of such Secured Obligation does not notify the Collateral Agent of the maximum ascertainable amount thereof at least two Business Days before such distribution, such holder will not be entitled to share in such distribution. If such holder does so notify the Collateral Agent as to the maximum ascertainable amount thereof, the Collateral Agent will allocate to such holder a portion of the monies to be distributed in such distribution, calculated as if such Secured Obligation were outstanding and then due and payable in such maximum ascertainable amount. However, the Collateral Agent will not apply such portion of such monies to pay such Secured Obligation, but instead will hold such monies or invest such monies in Liquid Investments. All such monies and Liquid Investments and all proceeds thereof will constitute Collateral hereunder, but will be subject to distribution in accordance with this Section 14(b) rather than Section 14(a). The Collateral Agent will hold all such monies and Liquid Investments and the net proceeds thereof in trust until all or part of such Secured Obligation becomes due and payable (or, in the case of a Contingent CA Secured Obligation, 38
becomes a Non-Contingent CA Secured Obligation), whereupon the Collateral Agent at the request of the relevant Secured Party will apply the amount so held in trust to pay such Secured Obligation; provided that, if the other Secured Obligations theretofore paid pursuant to the same clause of Section 14(a) were not paid in full, the Collateral Agent will apply the amount so held in trust to pay the same percentage of such Secured Obligation as the percentage of such other Secured Obligations theretofore paid pursuant to the same clause of Section 14(a). If (i) the holder of such Secured Obligation shall advise the Collateral Agent that no portion thereof (A) has not become due and payable or (B) remains in the category of a Contingent CA Secured Obligation, as the case may be, and (ii) the Collateral Agent still holds any amount held in trust pursuant to this Section 14(b) in respect of such Secured Obligation (after paying all amounts payable pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to any portions thereof that have become due and payable or become Non-Contingent CA Secured Obligations, as the case may be), such remaining amount will be applied by the Collateral Agent in the order of priorities set forth in the relevant clause of Section 14(a). (c) In making the payments and allocations required by this Section, the Collateral Agent may rely upon information supplied to it pursuant to Section 15(c). All distributions made by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section shall be final (except in the event of manifest error) and the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to inquire as to the application by any Secured Party of any amount distributed to it. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Domestic Security Document, the aggregate amount of proceeds of all sales of, and other realizations upon, Restricted Collateral applied pursuant to this Section 14 shall not at any time exceed the Basket Lien Available Amount at such time. Section 15. Concerning the Collateral Agent. The provisions of Article VIII of the Credit Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent in respect of this Agreement (as if the Collateral Agent were the Administrative Agent referred to therein) and shall be binding upon the parties to the Credit Agreement. In furtherance and not in derogation of the rights, privileges and immunities of the Collateral Agent therein specified: (a) The Collateral Agent is authorized to take all such action as is provided to be taken by it as Collateral Agent hereunder and all other action reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for herein (including, without limitation, the timing and methods of realization upon the Collateral) the Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting in accordance with written instructions from the Required 39
Lenders or, in the absence of such instructions, in accordance with its discretion. (b) The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the existence, genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or for the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the Security Interests in any of the Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to act on its part under the Security Documents. The Collateral Agent shall have no duty to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms of any Security Document by any Lien Grantor. (c) For all purposes of the Domestic Security Documents, including determining the amounts of the Secured Obligations and whether a Secured Obligation is a Contingent CA Secured Obligation or not, the Collateral Agent will be entitled to rely on information from (i) its own records for information as to the Lender and Agents, their Secured Obligations and actions taken by them, (ii) any Secured Party for information as to its Secured Obligations and actions taken by it, to the extent that the Collateral Agent has not obtained such information from the foregoing sources, and (iii) Xerox, to the extent that the Collateral Agent has not obtained information from the foregoing sources. Section 16. Appointment of Co-Collateral Agents. At any time or times, upon prior written notice to Xerox and in order to (a) comply with any legal requirement in any jurisdiction, (b) preserve or protect the Collateral, (c) exercise remedies specified in this Agreement or (d) otherwise carry out duties or exercise rights specified in this Agreement, the Collateral Agent may appoint another bank or trust company or one or more other Persons, either to act as co-agent or co-agents, jointly with the Collateral Agent, or to act as separate agent or agents on behalf of the Secured Parties with such power and authority as may be necessary for the effective operation of the provisions hereof and may be specified in the instrument of appointment (which may, in the discretion of the Collateral Agent, include provisions for the protection of such co-agent or separate agent similar to the provisions of Section 15). Section 17. Expenses. Xerox agrees that it will forthwith upon demand pay to the Collateral Agent: (i) the amount of any Taxes which the Collateral Agent may have been required to pay by reason of the Security Interests or to free any of the Collateral from any other Lien thereon; and (ii) the amount of any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and, upon the 40
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, of any other experts, which the Collateral Agent may incur in connection with (w) the administration or enforcement of the Security Documents, including such expenses as are incurred to preserve the value of the Collateral and the validity, perfection, rank and value of any Security Interest, (x) the collection, sale or other disposition of any of the Collateral, (y) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of any of the rights conferred upon it under the Security Documents or (z) any Event of Default. Any such amount not paid on demand shall bear interest at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans from time to time plus 2% and shall be an additional Secured Obligation hereunder. Section 18. Taxes. Each Guarantor agrees that: (a) All payments of Secured Obligations and all other amounts payable on, under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Domestic Security Document by such Guarantor, including, without limitation, amounts payable by such Guarantor under clause (b) of this Section 18, shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for all present and future Taxes (other than income or franchise taxes imposed on (or measured by) the net income of a Secured Party by a Secured Party Jurisdiction of that Secured Party) including any such Taxes imposed with respect to this Agreement or any other Domestic Security Document, the execution, registration, enforcement, notarization or other formalization of any thereof, and any payments of principal, interest, charges, fees, commissions or other amounts made on, under or in respect thereof (hereinafter called "Covered Taxes"), provided that, if any Guarantor shall be required to deduct any Covered Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable will be increased as necessary so that, after all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) are made, each relevant Secured Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. The parties agree to cooperate and provide information with respect to United States and foreign withholding tax matters relating to payments under this Agreement in a manner consistent with the principles of Section 2.16(e) of the Credit Agreement, mutatis mutandis. The parties also agree that the provisions of Section 2.16(f) of the Credit Agreement apply, mutatis mutandis, to Covered Taxes that are deducted, withheld or paid by a Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement. (b) Each Guarantor shall indemnify each Secured Party, within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Covered Taxes paid or incurred by such Secured Party with respect to any payment by or obligation of such Guarantor under or with respect to this Agreement or any other 41
Domestic Security Document (including Covered Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Covered Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Each Secured Party shall make a good faith effort to verify that such Covered Taxes are correctly and legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. An officer's certificate as to the amount of any such payment delivered to Xerox by a Secured Party on its own behalf, or by the Collateral Agent on behalf of a Secured Party, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) Within 15 Business Days after any Guarantor pays any Covered Taxes to a Governmental Authority, such Guarantor shall deliver to the Collateral Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment. Each Guarantor shall promptly furnish to each Secured Party any other information, documents and receipts that the Secured Party may from time to time reasonably request to establish to its satisfaction that full and timely payment of all Covered Taxes has been made. The applicable Guarantor will be deemed to have satisfied the requirement of this Section 18(c) if it has furnished such information, documents and/or receipts to the Collateral Agent. (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the payment increases and indemnities pursuant to those paragraphs will not apply to the payment of any Secured Obligation to the extent that (in the absence of this paragraph (d)) the Secured Party would thereby receive a net cash payment in respect of that Secured Obligation greater than if that Secured Obligation had been paid by the relevant Borrower. Section 19. Termination of Security Interests; Release of Collateral. (a) Each Security Interest granted hereunder shall terminate, and all rights to the relevant Collateral shall revert to the relevant Lien Grantor, if, as and to the extent permitted by Section 9.02 and 9.03 of the Credit Agreement, as the case may be. (b) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, if at any time prior to the termination of the Security Interests pursuant to this Section 19, the ESOP Secured Obligations are paid in full, all rights hereunder of the holders of ESOP Secured Obligations shall simultaneously terminate, and none of the Secured Subsidiary Guarantors shall thereafter be an ESOP Restricted Secured Subsidiary Guarantor. (c) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, if at any time prior to the termination of the Security Interests pursuant to this Section 19, 42
the XCFI Secured Obligations are paid in full, all rights hereunder of the holders of XCFI Secured Obligations shall simultaneously terminate. (d) Upon any termination of a Security Interest or release of Collateral, the Collateral Agent will, at the expense of the relevant Lien Grantor, execute and deliver to such Lien Grantor such documents as such Lien Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence the termination of such Security Interest or the release and reassignment of such Collateral, as the case may be. Section 20. Additional Guarantors and Lien Grantors. Any Domestic Subsidiary may become a party hereto by signing and delivering to the Collateral Agent a Guarantee and Security Agreement Supplement, whereupon such Subsidiary shall become a "Subsidiary Guarantor" and a "Lien Grantor" as defined herein. Section 21. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party at its address or telex or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof or at such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Collateral Agent and Xerox. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt. Section 22. Waivers, Non-Exclusive Remedies. No failure on the part of the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising and no course of dealing with respect to, any right or remedy under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party of any right under any Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies in the Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law. Section 23. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties and their successors and, in the case of the Lenders, permitted assigns pursuant to Section 9.04 of the Credit Agreement and in the event of an assignment of all or any of the Secured Obligations, the rights hereunder, to the extent applicable to the obligation so assigned, shall be automatically transferred with such obligation. This Agreement shall be binding on Xerox, each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns. 43
Section 24. Changes in Writing. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended, modified or terminated except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the parties hereto, with the consent of such Lenders as are required to consent thereto under Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement. Section 25. New York Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York, except as otherwise required by mandatory provisions of law and except to the extent that remedies provided by the laws of any jurisdiction other than New York are governed by the laws of such jurisdiction. Section 26. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO AND ANY OTHER SECURED PARTY BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BENEFITS HEREOF OR BY SEEKING TO ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY SECURITY DOCUMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY), AND EACH OF SUCH PARTIES (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. Section 27. Severability. If any provision of any Security Document is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) the other provisions of the Security Documents shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties in order to carry out the intentions of the parties hereto as nearly as may be possible; and (ii) the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. 44

SCHEDULE 1 PLEDGED SECURITIES (as of the Effective Date) Jurisdiction Number of of Owner of Percentage Shares or Issuer Organization Security Owned Units ------------- ---------------- ---------- ------------ ---------- S-1-1
SCHEDULE 2 TERMS OF SUBORDINATION SECTION 1. Agreement to Subordinate. The XCC Subordinated Obligations are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Schedule 2, to the prior payment in full of all XCC Senior Obligations. The subordination provisions are for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of XCC Senior Obligations or their designated representatives. SECTION 2. Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy. Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of XCC to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of XCC or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to XCC or its property: (1) holders of XCC Senior Obligations are entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all XCC Senior Obligations, including all interest accrued or accruing on XCC Senior Obligations after the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or similar case or proceeding at the contract rate (including, without limitation, any contract rate applicable upon default) specified in the XCC Indentures, whether or not the claim for the interest is allowed as a claim in the case or proceeding with respect to the XCC Senior Obligation (only such payment constituting "payment in full") before any holder of XCC Subordinated Obligations (the "XCC Secured Parties") will be entitled to receive any payment of XCC Subordinated Obligations; and (2) until the XCC Senior Obligations are paid in full, any distribution from the assets of XCC to which XCC Secured Parties would be entitled but for these subordination provisions shall instead be made to holders of XCC Senior Obligations as their interests may appear. SECTION 3. Payment Default at Final Maturity. XCC shall not pay any XCC Subordinated Obligations until such time as all the XCC Senior Obligations have been paid in full when due. SECTION 4. When Distribution Must Be Paid Over. If a payment or other distribution is made to the XCC Secured Parties that because of these subordination provisions should not have been made to them, the XCC Secured Parties that receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of XCC Senior Obligations and pay it over to them as their interests may appear. SECTION 5. Subrogation. A distribution made under these subordination provisions to holders of XCC Senior Obligations which otherwise S-2-1
would have been made to the XCC Secured Parties is not, as between XCC and the XCC Secured Parties, a payment by XCC on XCC Senior Obligations. After all XCC Senior Obligations are paid in full and until the XCC Subordinated Obligations are paid in full, the XCC Secured Parties will be subrogated to the rights of holders of XCC Senior Obligations to receive payments in respect of XCC Senior Obligations, which, to the extent received by the XCC Secured Parties, do not constitute, as between XCC and the XCC Secured Parties, payments by XCC on the XCC Subordinated Obligations. SECTION 6. Relative Rights; Subordination Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Accelerate. These subordination provisions define the relative rights of the XCC Secured Parties and holders of XCC Senior Obligations and do not impair, as between XCC and the XCC Secured Parties, the obligation of XCC, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the XCC Subordinated Obligations in accordance with their terms. The failure to make a payment pursuant to the XCC Subordinated Obligations by reason of these subordination provisions does not prevent the occurrence of a Default, nor do these subordination provisions have any effect on the right of the XCC Secured Parties or the Collateral Agent to accelerate the maturity of the XCC Subordinated Obligations upon an Event of Default or prevent the Collateral Agent or any XCC Secured Party from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of XCC Senior Obligations to receive distributions otherwise payable to the XCC Secured Parties. SECTION 7. Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company. No right of any holder of XCC Senior Obligations to enforce the subordination of the XCC Subordinated Obligations will be impaired by any act or failure to act by XCC or by its failure to comply with this Schedule 2. SECTION 8. Rights of Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent may continue to make payments on the XCC Subordinated Obligations and will not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than one Business Day prior to the date of such payment, the Collateral Agent receives notice satisfactory to it from XCC or a holder of XCC Senior Obligations that payments may not be made under this Schedule 2. SECTION 9. Collateral Agent Not Fiduciary for Holders of XCC Senior Obligations. The Collateral Agent will not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of XCC Senior Obligations and will not be liable to any such holders if it mistakenly pays over or distribute to the XCC Secured Parties, or to XCC or any other Person, any money or assets to which holders of XCC Senior Obligations are entitled by virtue of this Schedule 2. S-2-2
SECTION 10. Reliance by Holder of XCC Senior Obligations on Subordination Provisions; No Waiver. (a) Each XCC Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that these subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of XCC Senior Obligations, to acquire or to hold such XCC Senior Obligations, and each holder of XCC Senior Obligations will be deemed conclusively to have relied on these subordination provisions in acquiring and holding such XCC Senior Obligations. (b) The holders of XCC Senior Obligations may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Collateral Agent or the XCC Secured Parties, without incurring any liability or responsibility to the XCC Secured Parties, and without impairing the rights of holders of XCC Senior Obligations under these subordination provisions, do any of the following: (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, XCC Senior Obligations or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which XCC Senior Obligations is outstanding or secured; (2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing XCC Senior Obligations; (3) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment of XCC Senior Obligations; or (4) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against XCC and any other Person.

If acceleration of the time for payment of any Canadian Secured Obligation by the Canadian Borrower is stayed by reason of the insolvency or receivership of the Canadian Borrower or otherwise, all Canadian CA Secured Obligations otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any Loan Document shall nonetheless be payable by the relevant Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Collateral Agent. (g) Right of Set-Off. If any Canadian Secured Obligation is not paid promptly when due, each of the Secured Parties and their respective Affiliates is authorized, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Secured Party or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee, irrespective of whether or not such Secured Party shall have made any demand thereunder and although such deposits and other obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Secured Party under this Section 2(g) are in addition to all other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Secured Party may have. (h) Payments. Each payment to be made by any Guarantor in respect of any of the Canadian CA Secured Obligations shall be payable in the currency or currencies in which such Canadian CA Secured Obligations are denominated at the office of the Collateral Agent and to the extent permitted by law, shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any governmental authority excluding net income taxes or branch profit taxes or franchise taxes imposed in lieu of net income taxes imposed on the Collateral Agent or any of the Secured Parties as a result of a present or former connection between the Collateral Agent or any of the Secured Parties and the jurisdiction of the governmental authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any connection arising solely from the Collateral Agent or such Secured Party having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, as provided herein). (i) Continuing Guarantee. Each Guarantee is a continuing guarantee, shall be binding on the relevant Guarantor and its successors and assigns, and shall be enforceable by the Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties. If all or part of any Secured Party's interest in any Canadian Secured Obligation is assigned or otherwise transferred, the transferor's rights under 12
each Guarantee, to the extent applicable to the obligation so transferred, shall automatically be transferred with such obligation. (j) Limitation on Obligations of Guarantor. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (i) the obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such Guarantee invalid or unenforceable under Applicable Laws and (ii) the amount of the liability of each Guarantor for the Canadian CA Secured Obligations (A) pursuant to Section 2.14(a) of the Credit Agreement or Section 2.14(b) of the Credit Agreement, to the extent Section 2.14(b) relates to Loans or Letters of Credit, shall be limited to amounts so owing with respect to the increased costs or reduced rates of return arising from Loans to, or Letters of Credit issued for the account of, the Canadian Borrower and (B) except as set out in (A) above, pursuant to Section 2.14(b), shall be limited, at any particular time, to the amount which is proportionate to the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans to, and the aggregate of the LC Exposure and LC Reimbursement Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit issued for the account of, the Canadian Borrower to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans to, and the aggregate of the LC Exposure and LC Reimbursement Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit issued for the account of, all Borrowers at such time. SECTION 3. Representations and Warranties and Covenants. Each Lien Grantor and Guarantor represents and warrants, at the times set forth below, and covenants where indicated below, as follows: (a) It is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction identified as its jurisdiction of organization in the Perfection Certificate. (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by it and the performance by it of its obligations under this Agreement are (i) within its corporate or other powers, (ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action, (iii) require no consent or approval of, registration or filing with, any Governmental Authority except (A) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and (B) filings, recordings and registrations necessary to perfect the Security Interests, (iv) do not violate any Applicable Law or its organizational documents, (v) do not violate any order of any Governmental Authority except in any such case where such violation could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (vi) do not violate or result in a default under any indenture or material agreement or other instrument binding upon it and (vii) do not result in any Lien on any of its properties other than the Security Interests. (c) This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of it, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by (A) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (B) general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at equity or at law. (d) Schedule 1 of this Agreement sets forth the name and jurisdiction of organization of, and the ownership interest (including percentage owned and number of shares or units) of such Original Lien Grantor in the Securities issued by each of such Lien Grantor's direct 13
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, which are required to be included in the Collateral and pledged pursuant to Section 5.13(a) of the Credit Agreement and the Post-Closing Collateral and Guarantee Requirement. (e) All Pledged Securities owned by such Lien Grantor are owned by it free and clear of any Lien other than (i) the Security Interests (ii) the Permitted Encumbrances and (iii) any tax liens and judgment liens, that are CA Permitted Liens. None of such Pledged Securities is subject to any option to purchase or similar right of any Person other than Permitted Encumbrances, such Lien Grantor is not and covenants that it will not, become a party to or otherwise bound by any agreement (except the Loan Documents to which it is a party) which restricts in any material manner the rights of any present or future holder of any Pledged Securities with respect thereto. (f) Except for the Disclosed Matters, such Lien Grantor has good title to, or valid license or leasehold interests in, all of its Collateral which is material to its business (other than after-acquired Collateral in which such Lien Grantor will own or have rights in such Collateral at the time so acquired) free and clear of any Liens other than the (i) the CA Permitted Liens, (ii) the Permitted Encumbrances and (iii) other defects that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. (g) Other than financing statements, financing change statements or other similar or equivalent documents or instruments with respect to the Security Interests and other CA Permitted Liens, or that are in respect of consignments, sale of Accounts, operating leases or are otherwise precautionary, no financing statement, financing change statement, security agreement or similar or equivalent document or instrument covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file or of record in any jurisdiction in which such filing or recording is effective to perfect or record a Lien on such Collateral except (i) Liens that have been released and (ii) Liens the obligations secured by which have been satisfied, in each case as evidenced pursuant to the requirements of Section 4.01(f) of the Credit Agreement. After the Relevant Date applicable to a Lien Grantor, no Collateral owned by such Lien Grantor will be in the possession or under the control of any other Person having a claim thereto or security interest therein, other than the CA Permitted Liens. (h) The Security Interests on all Collateral to which the PPSA applies in which such Lien Grantor has rights (i) have been, or will on the Relevant Date applicable to such Lien Grantor be, validly created, (ii) will attach to each item of such Collateral on the Relevant Date applicable to such Lien Grantor (or, if such Lien Grantor first obtains rights thereto on a later date, on such later date) and (iii) when so attached, will constitute Collateral for the Canadian Secured Obligations of such Lien Grantor. (i) The Canadian Borrower has heretofore delivered the Perfection Certificate to the Collateral Agent. The information specified therein with respect to such Lien Grantor is correct and complete in all material respects as of the Relevant Date applicable to such Lien Grantor. Each other Lien Grantor shall provide the Collateral Agent with a Perfection Certificate in respect of such Lien Grantor on or before the Relevant Date applicable to it. 14
(j) When a PPSA financing statement or financing change statement describing the Collateral and naming such Lien Grantor as debtor has been filed in the applicable offices located in the jurisdictions where such Lien Grantor's assets are located as specified in the Perfection Certificate and the security interests in Collateral located in or subject to, the laws of the Province of Quebec have been published in the Register of Personal and Movable Real Rights ("RPMRR"), the Security Interests will constitute perfected security interests in the Collateral in which such Lien Grantor has rights in favour of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties to the extent that a security interest therein may be perfected by filing pursuant to the PPSA or the Civil Code of Quebec, as the case may be, prior to all Liens and rights of others therein except Permitted Liens. Except for the filing of such PPSA financing statements and financing change statements and the publication of the security interests in Collateral located in the Province of Quebec in the RPMRR, no registration, publication or filing with any Canadian, provincial or territorial governmental body, agency or official is required in connection with the execution or delivery of the Canadian Security Documents or is necessary for the validity or enforceability thereof or for the perfection or due recordation of the Security Interests in Canada or for the enforcement of the Security Interests. (k) As of the date hereof, the Inventory and Equipment are insured in accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement. SECTION 4. The Security Interests. (a) The Canadian Borrower, in order to secure the Canadian CA Secured Obligations and each Guarantor, if and when it becomes a Secured Guarantor, in order to secure its Canadian Secured Guarantor Obligations, grants to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties a continuing security interest in and to all of such Guarantor's respective right, title and interest in and to its now owned or hereafter acquired personal property, including all Proceeds, renewals, accretions and substitutions thereof, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising and regardless of where located, but subject to the exclusions in Section 4(b), and including, without limitation, the following: (i) all Accounts; (ii) all Chattel Paper; (iii) all deeds, documents, writings, papers, books of account and other books relating to or being records of debts, Chattel Paper or Documents of Title or by which such are or may hereafter be secured, evidenced, acknowledged or made payable; (iv) all Documents of Title (whether negotiable or not); (v) all Equipment; (vi) all Goods (including all parts, accessories, attachments, special tools, additions and accessions thereto); (vii) all Instruments; 15

(vii) Equity Interests in any Person that is not a Material Canadian Subsidiary or which are not directly owned by such Lien Grantor. (c) With respect to each right to payment or performance included in the Collateral from time to time, the Security Interest granted therein includes, subject to Permitted Encumbrances, a continuing security interest in (i) any supporting obligation that supports such payment or performance and (ii) any Lien that (x) secures such right to payment or performance or (y) secures any such supporting obligation. (d) The Security Interests are granted as security only and shall not subject the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party to, or transfer or in any way affect or modify, any obligation or liability of any Lien Grantor with respect to any of the Collateral or any transaction in connection therewith. (e) If the Collateral is realized upon and the security interest in the Collateral is not sufficient to satisfy all Canadian Secured Obligations, each Lien Grantor acknowledges and agrees that, subject to the provisions of the PPSA, such Lien Grantor shall continue to be liable for any Canadian Secured Obligations remaining outstanding and Collateral Agent shall be entitled to pursue full payment thereof. (f) Each Lien Grantor, on and from the Relevant Date applicable to such Lien Grantor, and the Collateral Agent hereby acknowledge that value has been given, such Lien Grantor has rights in the Collateral or, with respect to any after acquired Collateral, will have rights in such Collateral when so acquired and this Agreement constitutes a security agreement as that term is defined in the PPSA. (g) Each Guarantor (other than XCFI) shall be a Secured Guarantor, and such Guarantor's grant of a Security Interest in its Collateral hereunder shall become effective, on the date hereof, unless such Guarantor (other than XCFI) is either (i) a Restricted Guarantor or (ii) an ESOP Restricted Guarantor on the date hereof and in each case such Guarantor's grant of a Security Interest in its Collateral hereunder shall not become effective until, and such Guarantor shall not become a Secured Guarantor hereunder until, the first day after the end of the first Fiscal Year during which such Guarantor ceases to be either a Restricted Guarantor or an ESOP Restricted Guarantor. (h) XCFI's grant of a security interest in its Collateral hereunder shall not become effective until, and XCFI shall not become a Secured Guarantor hereunder until, the first day after the end of the first Fiscal Quarter after or containing the XCFI Release Date during which XCFI is not a Restricted Guarantor or an ESOP Restricted Guarantor. (i) Liens on the Collateral of any Secured Guarantor granted pursuant to this Agreement shall lapse, and such Guarantor shall cease to be a Secured Guarantor, starting on the day such Guarantor becomes a Restricted Guarantor; provided, however, that such Guarantor's grant of a security interest in its Collateral hereunder shall revive, and such Guarantor shall become a Secured Guarantor again, on the first day after the end of the next first Fiscal Quarter during which such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Guarantor. 17
SECTION 5. Further Assurances; Covenants. Each Lien Grantor covenants as follows: (a) Such Lien Grantor will furnish to the Collateral Agent promptly (but in any event within 20 Business Days of the occurrence of such event) written notice of any change in (i) its corporate, partnership, company or other legal name, (ii) its place of business or chief executive office if there is more than one principal place of business (determined as provided in the PPSA applicable to such Lien Grantor) or, if applicable, its domicile (as defined in the Civil Code of Quebec) or (iii) its identity or corporate structure. (b) Such Lien Grantor will, from time to time, at its expense, execute, deliver, file and record any statement, assignment, instrument, document, agreement or other paper and take any other reasonable action, (including, without limitation, any filings of financing or financing change statements under the PPSA) that from time to time is required under the PPSA or the Civil Code of Quebec to enable the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties to obtain the full benefits of the Canadian Security Documents or to enable the Collateral Agent to exercise and enforce any of its rights, powers and remedies under the Canadian Security Documents with respect to any of the Collateral. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, such Lien Grantor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent as such Lien Grantor's attorney-in-fact to execute and file all filings in Canada, including financing statements and financing change statements with respect to the Collateral, required or requested for the purposes of creating, perfecting and preserving the Security Interests, all acts of such attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed; and such power, is coupled with an interest, includes the power of substitution and shall be irrevocable until all the Security Interests granted by such Lien Grantor terminate pursuant to Section 19. Such Lien Grantor shall pay the costs of, or reasonable costs incidental to, any filing of any financing or financing change statements, the publication of notice under the RPMRR or other documents registered, recorded or filed pursuant thereto concerning the Collateral. (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, if any Collateral is in the possession or control of a warehouseman, bailee or agent, such Lien Grantor will upon request of the Required Revolving Lenders (i) notify such warehouseman, bailee or agent of the relevant Security Interests, (ii) instruct such warehouseman, bailee or agent to hold all such Collateral for the Collateral Agent's account subject to the Collateral Agent's instructions and to permit such Collateral to be removed by such Lien Grantor in the ordinary course of business until the Collateral Agent notifies such warehouseman, bailee or agent that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (iii) use reasonable commercial efforts (without incurring material obligations or foregoing material rights) to cause such warehouseman, bailee or agent to enter into an agreement for the benefit of Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties acknowledging that it holds possession of such Collateral for the Collateral Agent's benefit and otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. (d) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Lien Grantor shall stamp or otherwise mark all books and records relating to the Collateral in such manner, if any, as the Required Revolving Lenders may reasonably require in order to reflect the Security Interests. 18
(e) Such Lien Grantor will, promptly upon request, provide to the Collateral Agent all information and evidence in such Lien Grantor's possession, or under such Lien Grantor's control, or that can be generated internally or, if an Actionable Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, can otherwise be obtained by such Lien Grantor, without unreasonable effort or expense, which the Collateral Agent may reasonably request concerning the Collateral to enable the Collateral Agent to enforce the provisions of the Canadian Security Documents. (f) Such Lien Grantor will not Transfer, grant interests in, or grant any option with respect to, any of its Collateral; provided that such Lien Grantor may do any of the foregoing unless doing so would violate a covenant in the Credit Agreement. Concurrently with any such Transfer (except a Transfer to another Lien Grantor, a lease or a license) permitted by the foregoing proviso, the Security Interests on such assets Transferred (but not in any Proceeds arising from such Transfer) will cease immediately pursuant to Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement. (g) Each Lien Grantor that owns or has rights in movable property situated in, or subject to the laws of, the Province of Quebec shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent a Hypothec in respect of movable property and bond certificates and pledge agreement, if necessary (all substantially in the form which the Collateral Agent may reasonably request) and all other ancillary and supplementary documents or documentation required for publication with respect to any of the foregoing. SECTION 6. Recordable Intellectual Property. Each Lien Grantor covenants as follows: (a) Such Lien Grantor will notify the Collateral Agent promptly if it knows that any application or registration relating to any material Recordable Intellectual Property owned or licensed by it may become abandoned or dedicated to the public, or of any adverse determination or development (including the institution of, or any adverse determination or development in, any proceeding in the Canadian Intellectual Property Office) regarding such Lien Grantor's ownership of such material Recordable Intellectual Property, its right to register or patent the same, or its right to keep and maintain the same, except where the occurrence of the foregoing could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. If any of such Lien Grantor's rights to any material Recordable Intellectual Property are infringed, misappropriated or diluted, by a third party, such Lien Grantor will notify the Collateral Agent within 30 days after it learns thereof and will, unless such Lien Grantor shall reasonably determine that such action would be of negligible value, economic or otherwise, or the failure to take such action could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) promptly sue for infringement, misappropriation or dilution and to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution, (ii) take such other actions as such Lien Grantor shall reasonably deem appropriate under the circumstances to protect such material Recordable Intellectual Property and (iii) notify the Collateral Agent thereof to the extent required by the Credit Agreement. (b) Unless an Actionable Event of Default shall exist and the Collateral Agent shall have notified such Lien Grantor that the Lien Grantor's right to do so is terminated, suspended or 19
otherwise limited, the grant of Liens on Recordable Intellectual Property pursuant hereto shall not preclude any Lien Grantor from entering into any Copyright License, Design License, Patent License or Trademark License or, subject to Section 5, from managing or maintaining its Recordable Intellectual Property in a manner that is in the ordinary course of such Lien Grantor's business and consistent with such Lien Grantor's historical practices, as permitted by the Credit Agreement. SECTION 7. Pledged Securities. Each Lien Grantor represents, warrants and covenants as follows: (a) Certificated Securities. (i) With respect to each Original Lien Grantor, such Original Lien Grantor will deliver (A), on the Canadian Effective Date to the Collateral Agent as Collateral hereunder all certificates representing Pledged certificated Securities ("Pledged Certificated Securities") that are Equity Interests and issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary then directly owned by such Original Lien Grantor and identified on Schedule 1 of this Agreement as required to be pledged under Section 5.13(a) of the Credit Agreement and the Post-Closing Collateral and Guarantee Requirement and (B) in accordance with Section 5.13(b) of the Credit Agreement within 90 days after the Restatement Date, to the Collateral Agent as Collateral hereunder all certificates representing Pledged Certificated Securities that are Equity Interests issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary then directly owned by such Original Lien Grantor (to the extent such Securities have not been pledged and delivered pursuant to clause (i)(A) of this Section 7(a)). (ii) With respect to any other Lien Grantor, such Lien Grantor will deliver, on the date on which it signs and delivers its first Guarantee and Security Agreement Supplement (or on its Relevant Date in the case of a Guarantor which is not an Original Lien Grantor) to the Collateral Agent as Collateral hereunder all certificates representing Pledged Certificated Securities that are Equity Interests issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary then directly owned by such Lien Grantor and required to be included in the Collateral. (iii) After the pledge and delivery of Pledged Certificated Securities described in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7(a), whenever such Original Lien Grantor or such Lien Grantor, as the case may be, acquires direct ownership of any other certificate representing a Pledged Certificated Security that is an Equity Interest and required to be included in the Collateral, such Original Lien Grantor or such Lien Grantor, as the case may be, will promptly deliver such certificate to the Collateral Agent as Collateral hereunder. The provisions of this subsection are subject to the limitation in Section 7(g) in the case of Equity Interests that are subject to Permitted Encumbrances. (b) Uncertificated Securities. 20
(i) With respect to each Original Lien Grantor, such Original Lien Grantor will, (A) on the Canadian Effective Date in respect of each Pledged uncertificated Security ("Pledged Uncertificated Security") that is an Equity Interest and issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary then directly owned by such Original Lien Grantor and identified on Schedule 1 of this Agreement as required to be pledged under Section 5.13(a) of the Credit Agreement and the Post-Closing Collateral and Guarantee Requirement and (B) in accordance with Section 5.13(b) of the Credit Agreement within 90 days after the Restatement Date, in respect of each Pledged Uncertificated Security that is an Equity Interest issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary then directly owned by such Original Lien Grantor (to the extent that such Security has not been pledged pursuant to clause (i)(B) of this Section 7(b)), (x) such Lien Grantor shall give written instructions to the relevant depository institution or other applicable Person, together with a written copy thereof to the Collateral Agent, sufficient for the depository institution or other applicable Person to record in its book entry system that the Collateral Agent is the pledgee of each Pledged Uncertificated Security or (y) register the Collateral Agent as the registered owner of such Security on the books and records of the issuer, in each case as the Collateral Agent and such Original Lien Grantor may reasonably agree. (ii) With respect to any other Lien Grantor, such Lien Grantor will, on the date on which it signs and delivers its first Guarantee and Security Agreement Supplement (or on its Relevant Date in the case of a Guarantor which is not an Original Lien Grantor) in respect of each Pledged Uncertificated Security that is an Equity Interest issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary then directly owned by such Lien Grantor and required to be included in the Collateral (x) give written instructions to the relevant depository institution or other applicable Person, together with a written copy thereof to the Collateral Agent, sufficient for the depository institution or other applicable Person to record in its book entry system that the Collateral Agent is the pledgee of each Pledged Uncertificated Security or (y) register the Collateral Agent as the registered owner of such Security on the books and records of the issuer, in each case as the Collateral Agent and such Lien Grantor may reasonably agree. (iii) After the pledge of Pledged Uncertificated Securities described in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7(b), whenever such Original Lien Grantor or such Lien Grantor, as the case may be, acquires any other Pledged Uncertificated Security that is an Equity Interest and required to be included in the Collateral such Original Lien Grantor or such Lien Grantor, as the case may be, will promptly (x) give written instructions to the relevant depository institution or other applicable Person, together with a written copy thereof to the Collateral Agent, sufficient for the depository institution or other applicable Person to record in its book entry system that the Collateral Agent is the pledgee of each Pledged Uncertificated Security or (y) register the Collateral Agent as the registered owner of such Security on the books and records of the issuer, in each case as the Collateral Agent and such Original Lien Grantor or Lien Grantor, as the case may be, may reasonably agree. The provisions of this subsection are subject to (X) Section 9(c), and (Y) the limitation in Section 7(g) in the case of Equity Interests that are subject to Permitted Encumbrances. 21
(c) Perfection as to Certificated Securities. When such Lien Grantor delivers the certificate representing any Pledged Certificated Security that is an Equity Interest issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary, the Collateral Agent takes possession of the Pledged Certificated Securities or a person on its behalf other than such Lien Grantor or its agent, and, provided that the Collateral Agent has no notice of any adverse claim affecting the Pledged Certificated Securities, the Security Interest in the Pledged Certificated Securities has priority over any other security interest in the Pledged Certificated Securities. (d) Perfection as to Uncertificated Securities. When the Collateral Agent takes possession or constructive possession or when the Collateral Agent is registered as the registered owner of any Pledged Uncertificated Security that is an Equity Interest issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary owned by such Lien Grantor the Security Interest on such Pledged Uncertificated Security will be perfected, subject to no prior Liens or rights of others or a person on its behalf other than such Lien Grantor or its agent, if the Collateral Agent has no notice of any adverse claim affecting the Pledged Uncertificated Securities. (e) Delivery of Pledged Certificates. Any certificate representing a Pledged Certificated Security that is an Equity Interest issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary, when delivered to the Collateral Agent, will be in suitable form for transfer by delivery, or accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, signed by an authorized officer, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. (f) Communications. If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent shall have given notice to the Lien Grantors that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in Section 12, such Lien Grantor will promptly give to the Collateral Agent copies of any notices and other communications received by it with respect to Pledged Certificated Securities that are Equity Interests issued by any Material Canadian Subsidiary registered in the name of such Lien Grantor or its nominee. (g) Equity Interests subject to Permitted Encumbrances. Such Lien Grantor will not be obligated to comply with the provisions of this Section at any time with respect to any Equity Interest issued by any Person if and to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Equity Interest is excluded from the Collateral at such time pursuant to Sections 4(b)(i) or 4(b)(vii). (h) Direct Holding of Pledged Securities. Such Lien Grantor shall hold directly, and not through any subsidiary, securities intermediary or other Person, all Pledged Securities owned by it. SECTION 8. Collateral Account. (a) There is hereby established with the Collateral Agent, with respect to each Lien Grantor, a cash collateral account (its "Collateral Account") in the name and under the exclusive control of the Collateral Agent into which there shall be deposited from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Actionable Event of Default and upon notice from the Collateral Agent that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 8 the cash proceeds of the Collateral required to be delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to subsection 8(b) hereof or any other provision of any Canadian Security Document. Any income 22
received by the Collateral Agent with respect to the balance from time to time standing to the credit of each Collateral Account, including any interest or capital gains on Liquid Investments, shall remain, or be deposited, in the Collateral Account. All cash amounts on deposit in each Collateral Account from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, together with any Liquid Investments from time to time made pursuant to subsection 8(d) hereof, shall at all times be within the exclusive possession, dominion and control of the Collateral Agent, shall constitute part of the Collateral hereunder and shall not constitute payment of the Canadian Secured Obligations until applied thereto as hereinafter provided. (b) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and if so requested by the Required Lenders each Lien Grantor shall instruct all account debtors and other Persons obligated in respect of all Accounts then included in the Collateral to make all payments in respect of the Accounts either (i) directly to the Collateral Agent (by instructing that such payments be remitted to a post office box which shall be in the name of such Lien Grantor (with a notation that proceeds held therein are held in trust for and subject to the Liens of the Secured Parties) and under the control of the Collateral Agent) or (ii) under other arrangements, in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, pursuant to which such Lien Grantor shall have irrevocably instructed such other bank (and such other bank shall have agreed) to remit all proceeds of such payments directly to the Collateral Agent for deposit into the Collateral Account or as the Collateral Agent may otherwise instruct such bank. All such payments made to the Collateral Agent shall be deposited in such Lien Grantor's Collateral Account. In addition to the foregoing, such Lien Grantor agrees that if the proceeds of any Collateral hereunder (including the payments made in respect of Accounts) are received by it at a time when the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(b) are in effect, such Lien Grantor shall as promptly as possible deposit such proceeds into its Collateral Account. Until so deposited into the Collateral Account, all such proceeds shall, during the continuation of such Event of Default, be held in trust by such Lien Grantor for the Secured Parties and shall not be commingled with any other funds or property of such Lien Grantor. (c) Upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall, if so instructed by the Required Lenders, apply or cause to be applied (subject to collection) any or all of the balance from time to time standing to the credit of each Collateral Account in the manner specified in Section 14. (d) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, amounts on deposit in each Collateral Account, to the extent not applied in the manner specified in Section 14 pursuant to paragraph (c) above, shall if permitted by the terms of any agreement between the relevant Lien Grantor and the depository institution where such Collateral Account is held, be invested and re-invested from time to time in such Liquid Investments as the relevant Lien Grantor shall determine, which Liquid Investments shall be held in the name and be under the control of the Collateral Agent, provided that the Collateral Agent shall, if instructed by the Required Lenders, liquidate any such Liquid Investments and apply or cause to be applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Canadian Secured Obligations in the manner specified in Section 14; and provided further that the Collateral Agent shall, if so instructed by the relevant Lenders in the manner specified in Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement, liquidate any such Liquid Investments and release the proceeds thereof to the relevant Lien Grantor. For this 23
purpose, "Liquid Investments" means Permitted Investments; provided that each Liquid Investment shall mature within 30 days after it is acquired by the Collateral Agent. SECTION 9. Transfer of Record Ownership. (a) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may (and to the extent that action by it is required, the relevant Lien Grantor, if directed to do so by the Collateral Agent, will as promptly as practicable) cause each of the Pledged Securities (or any portion thereof specified in such direction) to be transferred of record into the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee. (b) Perfection upon Transfer of Record Ownership. If and when any Pledged Security (whether certificated or uncertificated) owned by such Lien Grantor is transferred of record into the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee pursuant to Section 7(b) or 9(a), the Security Interest on such Pledged Security will be perfected, subject to no prior Liens or rights of others. (c) Provisions Inapplicable after Transfer of Record Ownership. If the provisions of Section 9(a) are implemented, Section 7(b) shall not thereafter apply to any Pledged Security that is registered in the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee. (d) Communications after Transfer of Record Ownership. The Collateral Agent will promptly give to the relevant Lien Grantor copies of any notices and other communications received by the Collateral Agent with respect to Pledged Securities registered in the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee. SECTION 10. Right to Vote Securities and Receive Dividends. (a) Unless an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent shall have notified such Lien Grantor that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 10, each Lien Grantor will have the right, from time to time, to vote and to give consents, ratifications and waivers with respect to any Pledged Security owned by it, and the Collateral Agent will, upon receiving a written request from such Lien Grantor, deliver to such Lien Grantor or as specified in such request such proxies, powers of attorney, consents, ratifications and waivers in respect of any such Pledged Security that is registered in the name of the Collateral Agent or its nominee, in each case as shall be reasonably requested by such Lien Grantor. Unless an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent shall have notified such Lien Grantor that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 10, the Collateral Agent will have no right to take any action which the owner of a Pledged Partnership Interest is entitled to take with respect thereto, except the right to receive payments and other distributions to the extent provided herein. (b) If an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent shall have notified such Lien Grantor that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 10, the Collateral Agent will have the right to the extent permitted by Applicable Law (and, in the case of Collateral consisting of any Security that is subject to any Permitted Encumbrances, by the relevant agreement or governing document to the extent of any Permitted Encumbrances contained in such agreement or governing document) to vote, to give 24
consents, ratifications and waivers and to take any other action with respect to the Pledged Securities (if any) with the same force and effect as if the Collateral Agent were the absolute and sole owner thereof, and each Lien Grantor will take all such action as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request from time to time to give effect to such right. (c) Unless an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent shall have notified such Lien Grantor that it elects to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 10, dividends or other distributions paid on Pledged Equity Interests owned directly by such Lien Grantor shall be paid to such Lien Grantor. SECTION 11. General Authority. Each Lien Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent its true and lawful attorney, and such power is coupled with an interest with full power of substitution, in the name of such Lien Grantor, the Collateral Agent, the Secured Parties or otherwise, for the use and benefit of the Secured Parties, but at the Borrowers' expense, to the extent permitted by law to exercise, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Actionable Event of Default or upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, all or any of the following powers with respect to all or any of the Collateral: (a) to demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for any and all monies due or to become due thereon or by virtue thereof, (b) to settle, compromise, compound, prosecute or defend any action or proceeding with respect thereto, (c) upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise deal in or with the same or the proceeds thereof, as fully and effectually as if the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner of the Lien Grantor's right, title and interest therein, and (d) to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to make any allowance and other adjustments with reference thereto; provided that, except in the case of Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, the Collateral Agent will give the relevant Lien Grantor at least ten days' prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale thereof or the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition thereof will be made. Any such notice comply with the provisions of the PPSA and all other mandatory requirements of Applicable Law; provided that, if the Collateral Agent fails to comply with this sentence in any respect, its liability for such failure shall be limited to the liability (if any) imposed on it as a matter of law under the PPSA. SECTION 12. Remedies upon Actionable Event of Default or Acceleration. (a) Upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent may exercise (or cause its sub-agents to exercise) any and all remedies available to it (or to such sub-agents) under the Canadian Security Documents. 25
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent may exercise (or cause its sub-agents to exercise) on behalf of the Secured Parties all rights of a secured party after default under the PPSA (whether or not in effect in the jurisdiction where such rights are exercised) with respect to any Collateral and, in addition, the Collateral Agent may, without being required to give any notice, except as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, (i) withdraw all cash and Liquid Investments in the Collateral Accounts and apply such cash and Liquid Investments and other cash, if any, then held by it as Collateral as specified in Section 14 and (ii) if there shall be no such cash or Liquid Investments or if such cash and Liquid Investments shall be insufficient to pay all the Canadian Secured Obligations in full, take possession of, sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, and at such price or prices as the Collateral Agent may deem satisfactory. Any Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral so sold at any public sale (or, if the Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations, at any private sale). The relevant Lien Grantor will execute and deliver such documents and take such other action as the Collateral Agent deems reasonably necessary or proper in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with law. Upon any such sale the Collateral Agent shall have the right to deliver, assign and transfer to the purchaser thereof the Collateral so sold. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold to it absolutely and free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity or right of redemption of the relevant Lien Grantor which may be waived, and such Lien Grantor, to the extent permitted by law, hereby specifically waives all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal which it has or may have under any law now existing or hereafter adopted. The notice (if any) of such sale required by Section 11 shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section 11. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix in the notice of such sale. At any such sale the Collateral may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any such sale pursuant to any such notice. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to which the same may be so adjourned. In the case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until the selling price is paid by the purchaser thereof, but the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in the case of the failure of such purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in the case of any such failure, such Collateral may again be sold upon like notice. The Collateral Agent, instead of exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose the Security Interests and sell the Collateral, or any portion thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent jurisdiction. (b) For the purpose of enforcing any and all rights and remedies under the Canadian Security Documents upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Actionable Event of Default or upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, as the case may be, the Collateral Agent may (i) require any Lien Grantor to, and such Lien Grantor agrees that it will, at its expense and upon the request of the Collateral Agent, forthwith take reasonable steps to assemble all or any part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral 26
Agent and make it available at a place designated by the Collateral Agent which is, in its opinion, reasonably convenient to the Collateral Agent and such Lien Grantor, whether at the premises of such Lien Grantor or otherwise, (ii) to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, enter, with or without process of law and without breach of the peace, any premise where any of the Collateral is or may be located, and without charge or liability to it seize and remove such Collateral from such premises, (iii) have access to and use such Lien Grantor's books and records relating to the Collateral upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times and (iv) prior to the disposition of the Collateral, store or transfer it without charge in or by means of any storage or transportation facility owned or leased by such Lien Grantor, process, repair or recondition it or otherwise prepare it for disposition in any manner and to the extent the Collateral Agent reasonably deems appropriate and, in connection with such preparation and disposition, use without charge any Intellectual Property or technical process used by such Lien Grantor in connection therewith and included in the Collateral, subject, with respect to products being sold under Trademarks, to standards of quality with respect to such Products that are reasonably comparable to those prevailing at the time of such Actionable Event of Default. The Collateral Agent may also render any or all of the Collateral unusable at such Lien Grantor's premises and may dispose of such Collateral on such premises without liability for rent or costs. (c) If an Actionable Event of Default exists, the Collateral Agent may appoint or reappoint by instrument in writing, any person or persons, whether an officer or officers or an employee or employees of the Collateral Agent or not, to be a receiver or receivers (hereinafter called a "Receiver", which term when used herein shall include a receiver and manager) of the Collateral (including any interest, income or profits therefrom) and may remove any Receiver so appointed and appoint another in his/her or its stead. Any such Receiver shall, so far as concerns responsibility for his/her or its acts, be deemed the agent of the Lien Grantors and not the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party, and neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party shall be in any way responsible for any misconduct, negligence or non-feasance on the part of any such Receiver, his/her or its servants, agents or employees. Subject to the provisions of the instrument appointing him/her or it, any such Receiver shall (i) have such powers as have been granted to the Collateral Agent under subsection (a) and (b) above, and (ii) shall be entitled to exercise such powers at any time that such powers would otherwise be exercisable by the Collateral Agent under subsection (a) and (b) above, as applicable, which powers shall include the power to preserve Collateral or its value, and to carry on or concur in carrying on all or any part of the business of such Lien Grantor. To facilitate the foregoing powers, any such Receiver may, to the exclusion of all others, including such Lien Grantor, enter upon, use and occupy all premises owned or occupied by such Lien Grantor wherein Collateral may be situate, maintain Collateral upon such premises, and borrow money on a secured or unsecured basis and use Collateral directly in carrying on such Lien Grantor's business or as security for loans or advances to enable the Receiver to carry on such Lien Grantor's business or otherwise, as such Receiver shall, in its discretion, determine. Except as may be otherwise directed by the Collateral Agent, all money received from time to time by such Receiver in carrying out his/her or its appointment shall be received in trust for and paid over to the Collateral Agent. Every such Receiver may, in the discretion of the Collateral Agent, be vested with all or any of the rights and powers of the Collateral Agent. (d) The remedies specified in this Section 12 do not affect, and are in addition to, remedies otherwise specified for or available to the Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties under 27
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including, but not limited to, remedies available upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, or Actionable Event of Default, as the case may be. (e) The Collateral Agent hereby agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the exercise of rights and remedies by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 12 (or otherwise) with respect to any Collateral may be subject to the effect of any Permitted Encumbrances. SECTION 13. Limitation on Duty of Collateral Agent in Respect of Collateral. Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income thereon or as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, consignee or other agent or bailee selected by the Collateral Agent in good faith. SECTION 14. Application of Proceeds. (a) Upon (A) acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and (B) the exercise of remedies by the Collateral Agent under Section 12 hereof, the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral, shall be applied by the Collateral Agent as follows: first, to pay the expenses of such sale or other realization, including reasonable compensation to agents contemplated by Section 16 and counsel for the Collateral Agent, and all expenses, liabilities and advances incurred or made by the Collateral Agent in connection with the Canadian Security Documents, and then ratably (based on the proportion of the Loans to the Canadian Borrower to all Loans) to pay any other unreimbursed expenses for which the Collateral Agent is to be reimbursed pursuant to Section 18 hereof; second, to pay the unpaid principal of Revolving Loans to the Canadian Borrower (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section 14(b)), until payment in full of the principal of such Loans shall have been made (or so provided for); third, to pay all interest on the Loans to the Canadian Borrower and fees (to the extent payable by the Canadian Borrower or by Xerox on behalf of the Canadian Borrower) payable under the Credit Agreement to Revolving Lenders until payment in full of all such interest and fees shall have been made; fourth, to pay all other Canadian Secured Obligations ratably (or provide for the payment thereof pursuant to Section 14(b)), until payment in full of all 28
such other Canadian Secured Obligations shall have been made (or so provided for); and finally, to pay to the relevant Lien Grantor, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, any surplus then remaining from the proceeds of the Collateral owned by it. The Collateral Agent may make distributions hereunder in cash or in kind or, on a ratable basis, in any combination thereof. (b) If at any time any portion of any monies collected or received by the Collateral Agent would, but for the provisions of this Section 14(b), be payable in respect of a Canadian Contingent CA Secured Obligation or any other Canadian Secured Obligation that is not then due and payable (by reason of acceleration or otherwise), the Collateral Agent shall not apply any monies to pay such Canadian Secured Obligation but instead shall request the holder thereof, at least 10 days before each proposed distribution hereunder, to notify the Collateral Agent as to the maximum amount of such Canadian Secured Obligation if then ascertainable (e.g., in the case of a Letter of Credit, the maximum amount available for subsequent drawings thereunder, regardless of whether the conditions to drawing thereunder are then satisfied). If the holder of such Canadian Secured Obligation does not notify the Collateral Agent of the maximum ascertainable amount thereof at least two Business Days before such distribution, such holder will not be entitled to share in such distribution. If such holder does so notify the Collateral Agent as to the maximum ascertainable amount thereof, the Collateral Agent will allocate to such holder a portion of the monies to be distributed in such distribution, calculated as if such Canadian Secured Obligation were outstanding and then due and payable in such maximum ascertainable amount. However, the Collateral Agent will not apply such portion of such monies to pay such Canadian Secured Obligation, but instead will hold such monies or invest such monies in Liquid Investments. All such monies and Liquid Investments and all proceeds thereof will constitute Collateral hereunder, but will be subject to distribution in accordance with this Section 14(b) rather than Section 14(a). The Collateral Agent will hold all such monies and Liquid Investments and the net proceeds thereof in trust until all or part of such Canadian Secured Obligation becomes due and payable (or, in the case of a Canadian Contingent CA Secured Obligation, becomes a Canadian Non-Contingent CA Secured Obligation), whereupon the Collateral Agent at the request of the relevant Secured Party will apply the amount so held in trust to pay such Canadian Secured Obligation; provided that, if the other Canadian Secured Obligations theretofore paid pursuant to the same clause of Section 14(a) were not paid in full, the Collateral Agent will apply the amount so held in trust to pay the same percentage of such Canadian Secured Obligation as the percentage of such other Canadian Secured Obligations theretofore paid pursuant to the same clause of Section 14(a). If (i) the holder of such Canadian Secured Obligation shall advise the Collateral Agent that no portion thereof (A) has not become due and payable or (B) remains in the category of a Canadian Contingent CA Secured Obligation, as the case may be, and (ii) the Collateral Agent still holds any amount held in trust pursuant to this Section 14(b) in respect of such Canadian Secured Obligation (after paying all amounts payable pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to any portions thereof that have become due and payable or become Canadian Non-Contingent CA Secured Obligations, as the case may be), such remaining amount will be applied by the Collateral Agent in the order of priorities set forth in Section 14(a). 29
(c) In making the payments and allocations required by this Section, the Collateral Agent may rely upon information supplied to it pursuant to Section 15(c). All distributions made by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section shall be final (except in the event of manifest error) and the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to inquire as to the application by any Secured Party of any amount distributed to it. SECTION 15. Concerning the Collateral Agent. The provisions of Article VIII of the Credit Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent in respect of this Agreement (as if the Collateral Agent were the Administrative Agent referred to therein) and shall be binding upon the parties to this Agreement. In furtherance and not in derogation of the rights, privileges and immunities of the Collateral Agent therein specified: (a) The Collateral Agent is authorized to take all such action as is provided to be taken by it as Collateral Agent hereunder and all other action reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for herein (including, without limitation, the timing and methods of realization upon the Collateral) the Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting in accordance with written instructions from the Required Lenders or, in the absence of such instructions, in accordance with its discretion. (b) The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the existence, genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or for the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the Security Interests in any of the Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to act on its part under the Canadian Security Documents. The Collateral Agent shall have no duty to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms of any Canadian Security Document by any Lien Grantor. (c) For all purposes of the Canadian Security Documents, including determining the amounts of the Canadian Secured Obligations and whether a Canadian Secured Obligation is a Canadian Contingent CA Secured Obligation or not, the Collateral Agent will be entitled to rely on information from (i) its own records for information as to the Lender and Agents, their Canadian Secured Obligations and actions taken by them, (ii) any Secured Party for information as to its Canadian Secured Obligations and actions taken by it, to the extent that the Collateral Agent has not obtained such information from the foregoing sources, and (iii) Xerox, to the extent that the Collateral Agent has not obtained information from the foregoing sources. SECTION 16. Appointment of Co-Collateral Agents. At any time or times, upon prior written notice to Xerox and in order (a) to comply with any legal requirement in any jurisdiction, (b) preserve or protect the Collateral, (c) exercise remedies specified in this Agreement or (d) otherwise carry out duties or exercise rights specified in this Agreement, the Collateral Agent may appoint another bank or trust company or one or more other Persons, either to act as co-agent or co-agents, jointly with the Collateral Agent, or to act as separate agent or agents on behalf of the Secured Parties with such power and authority as may be necessary for the effective operation of the provisions hereof and may be specified in the instrument of appointment (which may, in the discretion of the Collateral Agent, include 30
provisions for the protection of such co-agent or separate agent similar to the provisions of Section 15). SECTION 17. Taxes Each Guarantor agrees that: (a) All payments of Canadian Secured Obligations and all amounts payable on, under or in respect of this Agreement by such Guarantor, including, without limitation, amounts payable by such Guarantor under clause (b) of this Section 17, shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for all present and future Taxes (other than income or franchise taxes imposed on (or measured by) the net income of a Secured Party by a Secured Party Jurisdiction of that Secured Party) including any such Taxes imposed with respect to this Agreement, the execution, registration, enforcement, notarization or other formalization of any thereof, and any payments of principal, interest, charges, fees, commissions or other amounts made on, under or in respect thereof (hereinafter called "Covered Taxes"), provided that, if any Guarantor shall be required to deduct any Covered Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable will be increased as necessary so that, after all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) are made, each relevant Secured Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. The parties agree to cooperate and provide information with respect to Canadian and foreign withholding tax matters relating to payments under this Agreement in a manner consistent with the principles of Section 2.16(e) of the Credit Agreement, mutatis mutandis. The parties also agree that the provisions of Section 2.16(f) of the Credit Agreement apply, mutatis mutandis, to Covered Taxes that are deducted, withheld or paid by a Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement. (b) Each Guarantor shall indemnify each Secured Party, within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Covered Taxes paid or incurred by such Secured Party with respect to any payment by or obligation of such Guarantor under or with respect to this Agreement or any other Canadian Security Document (including Covered Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 17) and any expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Covered Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Each Secured Party shall make a good faith effort to verify that such Covered Taxes are correctly and legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. An officer's certificate as to the amount of any such payment delivered to Xerox by a Secured Party on its own behalf, or by the Collateral Agent on behalf of a Secured Party, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) Within 15 Business Days after any Guarantor pays any Covered Taxes to a Governmental Authority, such Guarantor shall deliver to the Collateral Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment. Each Guarantor shall promptly furnish to each Secured Party any other information, documents and receipts that the Secured Party may from time to time reasonably request to establish to its satisfaction that full and timely payment of all Covered Taxes has been made. The applicable 31
Guarantor will be deemed to have satisfied the requirement of this Section 17(c) if it has furnished such information, documents and/or receipts to the Collateral Agent. (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the payment increases and indemnities pursuant to those paragraphs will not apply to the payment of any Canadian Secured Obligation to the extent that (in the absence of this paragraph (d)) the Secured Party would thereby receive a net cash payment in respect of that Canadian Secured Obligation greater than if that Canadian Secured Obligation had been paid by the Borrower. SECTION 18. Expenses. The Canadian Borrower agrees that it will forthwith upon demand pay to the Collateral Agent: (i) the amount of any Taxes which the Collateral Agent may have been required to pay by reason of the Security Interests or to free any of the Collateral from any other Lien thereon; and (ii) the amount of any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, and of any other experts, which the Collateral Agent may incur in connection with (w) the administration or enforcement of the Canadian Security Documents, including such expenses as are incurred to preserve the value of the Collateral and the validity, perfection, rank and value of any Security Interest, (x) the collection, sale or other disposition of any of the Collateral, (y) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of any of the rights conferred upon it under the Canadian Security Documents or (z) any Event of Default. Any such amount not paid on demand shall, unless prohibited by Applicable Law, bear interest at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans from time to time plus 2% and shall be an additional Canadian Secured Obligation hereunder. SECTION 19. Termination of Security Interests; Release of Collateral. (a) Each Security Interest granted hereunder shall terminate, and all rights to the relevant Collateral shall revert to the relevant Lien Grantor, if, as and to the extent permitted by Section 9.02 and 9.03 of the Credit Agreement, as the case may be. (b) Upon any termination of a Security Interest or release of Collateral, the Collateral Agent will, at the expense of the relevant Lien Grantor, execute and deliver to such Lien Grantor such documents as such Lien Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence the termination of such Security Interest or the release of such Collateral, as the case may be. SECTION 20. Additional Guarantors and Lien Grantors. Any Canadian Subsidiary may become a party hereto by signing and delivering to the Collateral Agent a Guarantee and Security Agreement Supplement, whereupon such Subsidiary shall become (a) a "Guarantor" or (b) a "Guarantor" and a "Lien Grantor" as defined herein. 32
SECTION 21. Change of Status. (a) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, if any Unrestricted Guarantor (other than XCFI before the XCFI Release Date) shall become a "Specified Subsidiary" under the Reference Indenture (or if the High Yield Indenture ceases to be the Reference Indenture, a corresponding category under the new Reference Indenture) after the Canadian Effective Date, such Guarantor shall be treated as a Restricted Guarantor for the purpose of this Agreement, and Liens on the Collateral of such Guarantor shall lapse. (b) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, if any Restricted Guarantor (other than XCFI before the XCFI Release Date) shall cease to be a "Specified Subsidiary" under the Reference Indenture (or if the High Yield Indenture ceases to be the Reference Indenture, a corresponding category under the new Reference Indenture) at the end of any Fiscal Year, such Guarantor shall be treated as an Unrestricted Guarantor for the purpose of this Agreement, and, unless such Guarantor is still an ESOP Restricted Guarantor, its grant of a Security Interest in its Collateral pursuant hereto shall become effective, starting the first day after the end of such Fiscal Year. (c) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, a Guarantor shall cease to be an ESOP Restricted Guarantor immediately after it or Xerox's obligations under the ESOP Guarantee Agreement have been terminated. (d) Upon becoming a Secured Guarantor under this Section 21, each such Secured Guarantor shall at its own expense, promptly execute and deliver all further documents and take all further action necessary or appropriate to give effect to the provisions and intent of this Agreement and to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, deliver to Collateral Agent all documents and instruments required to be delivered under Section 7 in respect of Pledged Securities. SECTION 22. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party at its address or telex or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof or at such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for such purpose by notice to the Collateral Agent and the Canadian Borrower. All notices and other communication given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt. SECTION 23. Waivers, Non-Exclusive Remedies. No failure on the part of the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising and no course of dealing with respect to, any right or remedy under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party of any right under any Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies in the Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law. 33
SECTION 24. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties and their successors and, in the case of the Lenders, permitted assigns pursuant to Section 9.04 of the Credit Agreement and in the event of an assignment of all or any of the Canadian Secured Obligations, the rights hereunder, to the extent applicable to the obligation so assigned, shall be automatically transferred with such obligation. This Agreement shall be binding on the Canadian Borrower, each Guarantor and its successors and assigns. SECTION 25. Changes in Writing. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended, modified or terminated except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the parties hereto, with the consent of such Lenders as are required to consent thereto under Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement. SECTION 26. Ontario Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, except as otherwise required by mandatory provisions of law and except to the extent that remedies provided by the laws of any jurisdiction other than Ontario are governed by the laws of such jurisdiction. SECTION 27. Judgment Currency If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from a Guarantor or the Canadian Borrower in the currency expressed to be payable in any Loan Document (the "specified currency") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Collateral Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Collateral Agent's Toronto office on the domestic Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligations of the Guarantor or the Canadian Borrower in respect of any sum due to the Collateral Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the domestic Business Day following receipt by the Collateral Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency the Collateral Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency; if the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Collateral Agent, in the specified currency, the Guarantor or the Canadian Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Collateral Agent, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Collateral Agent, in the specified currency, then the Collateral Agent agrees to remit such excess to the Guarantor or the Canadian Borrower. 34
SECTION 28. Interest Act For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of interest or fees provided in the Credit Agreement and in this Agreement (and stated herein as applicable to be computed on the basis of a 365 day year or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent are the rates so determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 365 or such other period of time. SECTION 29. Saskatchewan It is hereby agreed that The Limitation of Civil Rights Act of the Province of Saskatchewan, or any provision thereof, shall have no application to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument renewing or extending or collateral to this Agreement. SECTION 30. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO AND ANY OTHER SECURED PARTY BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BENEFITS HEREOF OR BY SEEKING TO ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY CANADIAN SECURITY DOCUMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED THEREBY AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY), AND OF EACH OF SUCH PARTIES (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR COUNSEL OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Payments in Gross All dividends, compositions and moneys received by the Administrative Agent from the Principal or from any other person which are capable of being applied by the Administrative Agent in reduction of the Guaranteed Moneys shall be regarded for all purposes as payments in gross and accordingly shall not prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent to recover from the Guarantors to the full extent of this Deed the ultimate balance which, after the receipt of such dividends, compositions and moneys, may remain owing to the Administrative Agent. 10. Suspense Account For the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent to sue the Principal or any other surety or prove in the Dissolution of the Principal or any other surety for the whole of the Guaranteed Moneys, or to preserve intact the liability of any other party, the Administrative Agent may, for as long as the Guaranteed Moneys have not been discharged and satisfied in full, at its sole discretion, place and retain on a suspense account, for as long as it considers fit, any moneys received, recovered or realised under or in connection with this Deed or under any other guarantee and/or indemnity or any security without any obligation on the part of the Administrative Agent to apply the same in or towards the discharge of the Guaranteed Moneys except when such moneys would be sufficient to discharge the Guaranteed Moneys in full in which case they shall be applied to such discharge and without any right on the part of the Guarantors to sue the Principal or any other surety or to prove in the Dissolution of the Principal or any other surety in competition with or so as to diminish any dividend or other
7 advantage that would or might come to the Administrative Agent, or to treat the liability of the Principal or any other surety as diminished. 11. Certificate to Be Conclusive Evidence A copy of a certificate signed by an officer of the Administrative Agent as to the amount of any indebtedness comprised in the Guaranteed Moneys: (A) calculated in accordance with Section 2.08(e) of the Credit Agreement shall, in the absence of manifest error, be prima facie evidence; and (B) decided pursuant to any judgment against the Principal shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive evidence for the purposes of any Proceedings, against the Guarantors that such amount is in fact due and payable by the Principal to the Administrative Agent. 12. Principal Debtor As an original and independent obligation under this Deed and without prejudice to any other provision in this Deed, the Guarantors jointly and severally agree that any of the Guaranteed Moneys which may not be recoverable from the Guarantors on the footing of a guarantee whether by reason of any legal limitation or incapacity on or of the Principal or by reason of any other fact or circumstance whatsoever (and whether any such fact or circumstance shall have been known to the Administrative Agent or not) shall nevertheless be recoverable from the Guarantors as though the same had been incurred by the Guarantors as sole or principal debtor and shall be paid by the Guarantors on demand. 13. No Discharge of Guarantors Subject to the terms of Clause 7, no Guarantor shall be released or discharged from any of its obligations under this Deed, nor shall any of such obligations be in any way prejudiced or affected, by: (A) any invalidity, unenforceability, illegality or voidability of any obligation expressed to be assumed or owed by the Principal under or in connection with the Credit Agreement; or (B) any variation or amendment of, or waiver or release granted under or in connection with, the Credit Agreement or other document; or (C) time being given, or any other indulgence or concession being granted, by the Administrative Agent to the Principal or any other person; or (D) the taking, holding, failure to take or hold, varying, realisation, non-enforcement, non-perfection or release by the Administrative Agent or any other person of any other guarantee and/or indemnity or any security for any of the Guaranteed Moneys; or
8 (E) the Dissolution of the Principal or any other person; or (F) any change in the constitution of the Principal; or (G) any amalgamation, merger or reconstruction that may be effected by the Administrative Agent with any other person or any sale or transfer of the whole or any part of the undertaking and assets of the Administrative Agent to any other person; or (H) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which any of the Guarantors may have at any time against the Principal, the Administrative Agent or any other person, or which the Principal may have at any time against the Administrative Agent, whether in connection with the Credit Agreement or otherwise; or (I) the granting by the Administrative Agent to the Principal of any other financial accommodation or the withdrawal or restriction by the Administrative Agent of any financial accommodation, or the absence of any notice to any of the Guarantors of any such granting, withdrawal or restriction; or (J) any arrangement or compromise entered into by the Administrative Agent with the Principal or any other person; or (K) any other thing done or omitted or neglected to be done by the Administrative Agent or any other person or any other dealing, fact, matter or thing (including, but without limitation, any circumstances whatsoever affecting or preventing recovery of amounts under the Credit Agreement) which, but for this provision, might operate to exonerate or discharge any of the Guarantors from, or otherwise prejudice or affect, any of the Guarantors' obligations under this Deed. 14. Guarantors Not to Take Security 14.1 No Security Presently Held Each of the Guarantors represents and warrants that it has not taken or received any security from the Principal or any other surety for or in respect of that Guarantor's obligations under this Deed. 14.2 Guarantors Shall Not Take Security No Guarantor shall take or receive any security from the Principal or any other surety for or in respect of that Guarantor's obligations under this Deed. 14.3 Security Held on Trust If at any time any of the Guarantors has the benefit of any security in breach of this clause 14, it shall hold such security on trust for the Administrative Agent, and shall, upon request by the Administrative Agent, transfer or assign such security to the Administrative Agent as security for that Guarantor's obligations under this Deed.
9 This clause 14.3 is intended to give rise to rights in contract and equitable rights only and is not intended to constitute, create or give rise to a security interest of any kind over any asset of Guarantor.

10 under this Deed. If any balance of such moneys shall remain after such Guarantor's obligations have been discharged in full, such balance shall forthwith be released from such trust and shall belong absolutely and beneficially to that Guarantor. 17. Representations and Warranties 17.1 Initial Representations Each Guarantor confirms that each of the following is true: (A) Legal Status It is a company duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of England.

No analogous event has occurred in any jurisdiction. 17.2 Repetition The representations in clause 17.1 will be deemed repeated by each of the Guarantors on the date of each Borrowing by the Principal and the date of each issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of Credit issued to the Principal. This repetition will be with reference to the facts on that day. 18. Currency 18.1 Payments to be Made in Same Currency All payments to be made under this Deed shall be made in the currency or currencies in which the Guaranteed Moneys were expressed to be payable by the Principal, and strictly in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. 18.2 Currency Indemnity If, under any applicable law, whether pursuant to a judgment against any of the Guarantors or the Dissolution of any of the Guarantors or for any other reason, any payment under or in connection with this Deed is made or falls to be satisfied in a currency (the "Other Currency") other than the currency in which the relevant payment is expressed to be payable (the "Required Currency"), then, to the extent that the payment actually received by the Administrative Agent (when converted into the Required Currency at the rate of exchange on the date of payment or, if it is not practicable for the Administrative Agent to make the conversion on that date, at the rate of exchange as soon afterwards as it is practicable for the Administrative Agent to do so or, in the case of a Dissolution, at the rate of exchange on the
12 latest date permitted by applicable law for the determination of liabilities in such Dissolution) falls short of the amount expressed to be due or payable under or in connection with this Deed, the Guarantors jointly and severally shall, as an original and independent obligation under this Deed, indemnify and hold the Administrative Agent harmless against the amount of such shortfall. For the purpose of this clause 18, "rate of exchange" means the rate at which the Administrative Agent is able on the relevant date to purchase the Required Currency with the Other Currency and shall take into account any commission, premium and other costs of exchange and Taxes payable in connection with such purchase. 19. No Set-off or Withholding by Guarantors 19.1 No Set-off All payments to be made by any Guarantor under this Deed shall be made in full without any set-off, restriction or condition and without any deduction for or on account of any counterclaim. 19.2 No Withholding, Gross-Up and Tax Indemnity In this Clause 19.2 "Covered Taxes" means all present and future Taxes (other than income or franchise taxes imposed on (or measured by) the net income of a Revolving Lender by a Lender Party Jurisdiction of that Revolving Lender) including any such Taxes imposed with respect to this Deed, the execution, registration, enforcement, notarization or other formalization of any thereof, and any payments of principal, interest, charges, fees, commissions or other amounts made on, under or in respect thereof. Each Guarantor agrees that:- (a) All payments of Guaranteed Moneys and all other amounts payable on, under or in respect of this Deed by such Guarantor, including, without limitation, amounts payable by such Guarantor under paragraph (b) of this Clause 19.2, shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of Covered Taxes save as may be required by law, provided that, if any Guarantor shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Covered Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable will be increased as necessary so that, after all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) are made, each relevant Revolving Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) such Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. The parties agree to co-operate and provide information with respect to United Kingdom, United States and foreign withholding tax matters relating to payments under this Deed in a manner consistent with the principles of Section 2.16(e) of the Credit Agreement, mutatis mutandis. The parties also agree that the provisions of Section 2.16(f) of the Credit Agreement apply, mutatis mutandis, to Covered Taxes that are deducted, withheld or paid by a Guarantor pursuant to this Deed. (b) Each Guarantor shall indemnify each Revolving Lender, within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Covered Taxes paid or incurred by such
13 Revolving Lender with respect to any payment by or obligation of such Guarantor under or with respect to this Deed (including Covered Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Clause 19.2) and any expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Covered Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Each Revolving Lender shall make a good faith effort to verify that such Covered Taxes are correctly and legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. An officer's certificate as to the amount of any such payment delivered to Xerox by a Revolving Lender on its own behalf, or by the Administrative Agent on behalf of a Revolving Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) Within 15 Business Days after any Guarantor pays any Covered Taxes to a Governmental Authority in accordance with this Clause 19.2, such Guarantor shall certify to the Administrative Agent's reasonable satisfaction that it has so paid such Covered Taxes. If an original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment is available, the Guarantor shall deliver the same to the Administrative Agent as soon as is practicable. Each Guarantor shall promptly furnish to each Revolving Lender any other information, documents and receipts that the Revolving Lender may from time to time reasonably request to establish to its satisfaction that full and timely payment of all Covered Taxes has been made. The applicable Guarantor will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of this Clause 19.2(c) if it has furnished such information, documents and/or receipts to the Administrative Agent. (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the payment increases and indemnities pursuant to those paragraphs will not apply to the payment of any Guaranteed Moneys to the extent that (in the absence of this paragraph (d)) the Revolving Lender would thereby receive a net cash payment in respect of the Guaranteed Moneys greater than if the Guaranteed Moneys had been paid by the Borrower. 20. Set-off by Revolving Lenders 20.1 Revolving Lenders May Set-off Each of the Revolving Lenders and their respective Affiliates may, without notice to the Guarantors and without prejudice to any of the other rights of such Revolving Lender or its Affiliate, set off any matured obligation owed by any Guarantor under this Deed to such Revolving Lender or its Affiliate against any obligation (whether or not matured) owed by such Revolving Lender or its Affiliate to such Guarantor, regardless of the place of payment, booking branch or currency of such obligations. 20.2 Different Currencies If the obligations referred to in clause 20.1 are in different currencies, then, for the purpose of any such set-off, such Revolving Lender or its Affiliate may convert any such obligations at the rate of exchange determined by such Revolving Lender or its Affiliate, acting reasonably to be prevailing at the date of set-off.
14 20.3 No Security Interest This clause 20 is intended to give rise to rights in contract only and is not intended to constitute, create or give rise to a security interest of any kind over any asset of Guarantor. If and to the extent that any right conferred under this clause 20 would, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, constitute, create or give rise to any security interest, such right shall be of no effect. 21.

15 (B) if no date is specified or the date specified is less than five Business Days after the date on which notice is given, the date falling five Business Days after notice of any such change has been given. 22. Remedies and Waivers 22.1 Delay No delay or omission on the part of the Administrative Agent in exercising any right, power or remedy provided by law or under this Deed shall impair such right, power or remedy or operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right, power or remedy. 22.2 Single or Partial Exercise The single or partial exercise by the Administrative Agent of any right, power or remedy provided by law or under this Deed shall not preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. 22.3 Remedies to Be Cumulative The rights, powers and remedies provided in this Deed are cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any rights, powers and remedies provided by law. 23. Invalidity If at any time any provision of this Deed is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the law of any jurisdiction, neither: (A) the legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision of this Deed; nor (B) the legality, validity or enforceability under the law of any other jurisdiction of that or any other provision of this Deed, shall be affected or impaired. 24. Assignment The Administrative Agent may at any time, without the consent of the Guarantors, assign or transfer the whole or, as the case may be, any part of the Administrative Agent's rights under this Deed to any person to whom the whole or any part of the Administrative Agent's rights under the Credit Agreement may be assigned or transferred. 25.

Jurisdiction 28.1 The courts of England are to have jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Deed. Any Proceedings may therefore be brought in the English courts.

The Administrative Agent therefore is to retain the right to bring Proceedings in any court which has jurisdiction by virtue of rules which would be applicable apart from this jurisdiction agreement. Nothing contained in this clause 28 shall limit the right of the Administrative Agent to take Proceedings against any Guarantor in any other court or in the courts of more than one jurisdiction at the same time. 28.2 Each Guarantor irrevocably waives (and irrevocably agrees not to raise) any objection, on the ground of forum non conveniens or on any other ground, to the taking of Proceedings in any court referred to in this clause 28. Each party also irrevocably agrees that a judgement against it in Proceedings brought in any jurisdiction referred to in this clause 28 shall be conclusive and binding upon it and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction.

Security 3.1 Creation of security (A) Fixed Charge XCE with full title guarantee (except to the extent that any Permitted Encumbrance conflicts with such full title guarantee) and as continuing security for the payment and discharge of all Secured Sums charges in favour of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of itself and the Revolving Lenders) by way of first fixed charge: (i) all plant, machinery and equipment owned by XCE and XCE's interest in any plant, machinery or equipment in its possession; (ii) all Investments beneficially owned by XCE, and all dividends, interest and other distributions paid or payable in respect of those Investments; (iii) moneys (including interest) now or hereafter standing to the credit of the Collateral Account, and the debts represented by such moneys; (iv) all the goodwill of XCE; (v) all the uncalled capital of XCE; (vi) all the Intellectual Property Rights of XCE; (vii) all Book Debts; (viii) all Negotiable Instruments; (ix) all its rights under or in connection with all licences held in connection with the business of XCE or the use of any Charged Asset.

11 (xi) if not effectively assigned by Clause 3.2, all its rights and benefits under or in connection with each of the Policies, including, in each case both those assets currently held by XCE and those held in the future but excluding, in each case, any Excluded Assets. (B) Floating charge XCE with full title guarantee (except to the extent that any Permitted Encumbrance conflicts with such full title guarantee) and as continuing security for the payment and discharge of all Secured Sums charges in favour of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of itself and the Revolving Lenders) by way of first floating charge ranking behind all the fixed charges created by or pursuant to this Debenture but ranking, to the extent permitted by law, in priority to any other Security created after the date of this Debenture, except: (i) Security permitted by Clause 3.5(A); and (ii) Security ranking in priority in accordance with Clause 13.2(E) all its assets, including assets expressed to be charged by Clause 3.1(A) but excluding any Excluded Assets. 3.2 Security Assignment (A) As further continuing security for the payment of the Secured Sums, XCE assigns (to the fullest extent capable of assignment and subject to Clause 3.2(B)) with full title guarantee in favour of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of itself and the Revolving Lenders) all its rights, title and interest in: (i) the Assigned Agreements; and (ii) the Policies, including (without limitation): (a) all payments (including bonuses) that may become due under the Policies; and (b) all amounts due to XCE in connection with the Policies pursuant to section 76 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982, except, in each case, to the extent that such rights, title and interest in the Assigned Agreements or the Policies (as the case may be) are Excluded Assets, (B) (i) Until (y) the occurrence of an Actionable Event of Default which is continuing or acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and (z) receipt of notice from the Collateral
12 Agent, XCE shall be entitled to continue to deal with the counterparties to the Assigned Agreements and the Policies. (ii) On payment or discharge in full of the Secured Sums the Collateral Agent will at the request and cost of XCE re-assign the Assigned Agreements and the Policies to XCE (or as it shall direct). 3.3 Conversion of floating charge into fixed charge (A) Conversion: The floating charge created by Clause 3.1(B) will convert into a fixed charge in the circumstances described in this Clause 3.3.

This notice must describe the assets which are affected by the conversion. This description can be general or specific. A notice may only be given under this paragraph in either of the following cases: (i) An Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. (ii) The Collateral Agent considers that the assets which are affected by the conversion are in danger of being seized or sold under any legal process or to be otherwise in jeopardy. In this case conversion will occur in accordance with the terms of the notice. It will take effect on the date of delivery of the notice or, if later, the date specified in the notice. (C) Automatic conversion: Conversion will occur automatically if: (i) any Security (other than Security permitted by Clause 3.5(A) or Clause 13.2(E) exists over XCE's interest in the assets covered by the floating charge; or (ii) any person levies or attempts to levy any distress, attachment, execution or other legal process against any of the assets covered by the floating charge. The conversion will affect those assets affected by the matter described in sub-paragraph (i) or (ii). It will take effect the instant before sub-paragraph (i) or (ii) applies. (D) Re-conversion: Any fixed charge created over any asset pursuant to Clause 3.3(C)(ii) will be re-converted to a floating charge if the distress, attachment, execution or other legal process which gave rise to the conversion under Clause 3.3(C)(ii) has been discharged, discontinued, removed or vacated or
13 has, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Agent, otherwise ceased to affect such asset. 3.4 Nature of Security (A) Continuing Security: The Charges are continuing security. No payment or other settlement will discharge the Charges until the Secured Sums have been discharged in full. (B) Other Security: The Charges are in addition to, and independent of, any other Security or guarantee. (C) Charges not to be affected: The Charges will only be discharged upon their release in accordance with this Debenture. They will not be discharged by any other action, omission or fact.

14 (ix) The winding-up or re-organisation of XCE or any other person. (x) Any change in the constitution, condition, nature or status of XCE. (xi) Any other matter which might discharge the Charges other than a release from the Charges in accordance with the terms of this Debenture. 3.5 Restrictions on other Security and disposals XCE agrees that except with the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent: (A) Security: It will not create or permit to subsist any Security on, over or with respect to any of its assets except (i) for Permitted Encumbrances, (ii) over Excluded Assets and (iii) as permitted by Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement.

This delivery or payment will be made promptly after the Collateral Agent's request. 5. Further Advances The Charges are intended to secure further advances. The Collateral Agent (acting in its capacity as Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement) agrees to make further advances in respect of Revolving Loans in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Agent (acting in its capacity as Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement) will, however, only have an obligation under this Clause to the extent it receives funds from the Lender or Lenders making such Revolving Loan or Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.05 of the Credit Agreement. 6.

Payments under any Assigned Agreement made to the Collateral Agent will be paid into the Collateral Account. 12.2 Charges becoming enforceable The Charges will be enforceable at any time upon acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. At this time the powers conferred by section 101 of the LPA, as varied and extended by this Debenture, will be exercisable. 12.3 Section 101 LPA The powers conferred by section 101 of the LPA, as varied and extended by this Debenture, arise on the date of this Debenture. 12.4 Sections 93 and 103 LPA Sections 93 and 103 of the LPA do not apply to this Debenture. 12.5 Enforcement This sub-clause applies when the Charges are enforceable pursuant to Clause 12.2. In this case each of the following applies: (A) Application of Book Debts, Assigned Agreements and the Collateral Account: The Collateral Agent may apply: (i) the Book Debts; (ii) payments under the Assigned Agreements made to the Collateral Agent; and (iii) moneys standing to the credit of the Collateral Account, in payment of the Secured Sums.

(D) Scope of appointment: A Receiver may be appointed in respect of all the Collateral or any part of them specified in the appointment.

This sub-clause is subject to section 36 of the Insolvency Act. 14.

This applies whether or not the Collateral Agent has taken possession or appointed a Receiver. 14.2 Prior Security This sub-clause applies if there is any other Security (other than Permitted Encumbrances and as permitted by Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement) over the
28 Collateral ranking ahead of the Charges. In this case the Collateral Agent may do any of the following: (A) Redeem that other Security. (B) Procure the transfer of that other Security to the Collateral Agent. (C) Discharge the debts secured by that other Security. In this case the discharge of those debts will be conclusive and binding on XCE. XCE agrees that it will reimburse the Collateral Agent for: (i) all amounts paid or committed by the Collateral Agent in exercise of its rights under this sub-clause; and (ii) all losses, liabilities and expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of these rights. 14.3 Subordinate Security This sub-clause applies when either of the following has occurred: (A) The Collateral Agent receives actual or constructive notice of any other Security over the Collateral ranking behind the Charges or created after the Charges. (B) The Dissolution of XCE. When this sub-clause applies the Collateral Agent may open a new account in the name of XCE (whether or not it permits any existing account to continue). If the Collateral Agent does not open a new account, it will be treated as if it had done so at the time (the "cut-off time") it received notice or, as the case may be, the Dissolution commenced. After that time all payments made by XCE to the Collateral Agent, or received by the Collateral Agent for the account of XCE, will be credited, or treated as having been credited, to the extent permitted by law, to the new account. Those payments will not operate to reduce the amount secured by this Debenture at the cut-off time. 14.4 Suspense Account The Collateral Agent may, for as long as any of the Secured Sums for which any other person may be liable as principal debtor or as co-surety with XCE have not been paid or discharged in full, at its sole discretion, place and retain on a suspense account, for as long as it considers fit, any moneys received, recovered or realised under or in connection with this Debenture to the extent of such Secured Sums without any obligation on the part of the Collateral Agent to apply the same in or towards the discharge of such Secured Sums except when such moneys would be sufficient to
29 discharge the Secured Sums in full in which case they shall be applied to such discharge. 14.5 Delegation The Collateral Agent may delegate any of the rights which it may exercise under this Debenture. The delegation will be on terms determined by the Collateral Agent to any person chosen by the Collateral Agent. It may allow the delegate to sub-delegate his powers. 15. Application of moneys Amounts received by the Collateral Agent under this Debenture are to be applied in the following order: (A) Towards payment of all losses, liabilities and expenses: (i) incurred by any Receiver; or (ii) incidental to the appointment of any Receiver, including the remuneration of that Receiver. (B) Towards the payment of the Secured Sums in an order determined by the Collateral Agent. (C) After all the Secured Sums have been paid or discharged in full, any surplus will be paid to XCE or other person entitled to it. This Clause does not affect any right of the Collateral Agent under this Debenture. 16. Liability of the Collateral Agent and other persons 16.1 Possession of the Collateral If the Collateral Agent, any Receiver or any Delegate takes possession of the Collateral, it may relinquish that possession at any time. 16.2 Limitation of the Collateral Agent's liability (A) The Collateral Agent will not be liable to account to XCE or any other person for anything except the Collateral Agent's actual receipts. (B) The Collateral Agent will not be liable to XCE or any other person for any losses, liabilities or expenses arising from or connected with: (i) any realisation of the Collateral; or
30 (ii) any act, default, omission or misconduct of the Collateral Agent, its officers, employees or Collateral Agents in relation to the Collateral. This paragraph does not, however, apply to the extent that a loss, liability or expense is determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the Collateral Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct or that of its officers or employees. (C) This sub-clause applies where the loss, liability or expense: (i) arises because of the taking of possession of Collateral; or (ii) arises in the Collateral Agent's capacity as mortgagee in possession. It also applies in all other cases where the Collateral Agent would otherwise be liable. 16.3 Limitation of the liability of other persons No Receiver or Delegate or any officer, employee or agent of the Collateral Agent, any Receiver or any Delegate will be liable to XCE or any other person in relation to this Debenture except for their own negligence or wilful misconduct. 16.4 Indemnity Each of the Collateral Agent and every Receiver, Delegate, attorney, manager, agent or other person appointed by the Collateral Agent is entitled to be reimbursed out of the Collateral in respect of all losses, liabilities (except to the extent that such loss or liability is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of that person or that of its officers or employees) and reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by any of them: (A) in the execution or purported execution of any of its rights; or (B) relating to the Collateral. Each amount to be reimbursed under this sub-clause may be deducted from any moneys received in respect of the Collateral. 17. Protection of third parties No person dealing with the Collateral Agent, any Receiver or any Delegate is to be concerned to enquire about any of the following: (A) Whether any right under or in connection with this Debenture, the LPA or the Insolvency Act is exercisable.
31 (B) Whether any consent, regulation, restriction or direction relating to those rights has been obtained or complied with. (C) As to the propriety or regularity of acts purporting or intended to be in exercise of those rights or as to the application of any money borrowed or raised or other proceeds of enforcement. All the protections to purchasers contained in sections 104 and 107 of the LPA, section 42(3) of the Insolvency Act or in any other legislation applies to any person purchasing from, or dealing with, the Collateral Agent, any Receiver or any Delegate.
32 PART V: MISCELLANEOUS 18. Power of Attorney 18.1 Appointment (A) XCE appoints as its attorney each of the Collateral Agent, each Receiver and each Delegate. Each attorney may act without the others and may do any of the following on behalf of XCE: (i) Anything which XCE is obliged to do under this Debenture to create Security over any of the assets of XCE which are expressed to be subject to the Charges, or to perfect, preserve or protect the Security over the Collateral, or to preserve or protect the rights of the Collateral Agent therein, but has not done within 14 days of receipt of notice from the Collateral Agent. (ii) Anything necessary to facilitate the exercise by the Collateral Agent, any Receiver or any Delegate of its rights in relation to the Collateral or under or in connection with this Debenture, the LPA or the Insolvency Act, provided that anything done pursuant to this paragraph (ii) shall be done at such time or times as are permitted by, and in accordance with the terms of, this Debenture, the LPA or the Insolvency Act, as the case may be. The attorney may act in the name of XCE or in any other manner determined by the attorney. (B) The power of attorney in paragraph (A) is irrevocable and granted by way of security. (C) Each attorney has full powers of substitution and delegation. 18.2 Ratification XCE agrees to ratify and confirm everything each attorney does, or purports to do, in the exercise, or purported exercise, of the power of attorney in Clause 18.1. 19. Notices (A) A notice under this Debenture shall be made in writing by letter or facsimile transmission. (B) Notices under this Debenture shall (unless that other party has by five days' written notice specified another address) be sent to a party addressed as follows: (i) if to XCE to:
33 [ ] Attention: [ ] Facsimile: [ ] (ii) if to the Collateral Agent to: [ ] Attention: [ ] Facsimile: [ ] (C) Any notice given under this Debenture shall be deemed to have been duly given on the date of receipt. 20. Invalidity This clause applies if any part of this Debenture is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable under the law of any jurisdiction. In this case neither of the following will be affected or impaired: (A) The legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other part of this Debenture. (B) The legality, validity or enforceability under the law of any other jurisdiction of that or any other part of this Debenture. 21. Assignment The Collateral Agent may, without the consent of XCE, assign or transfer any of its rights under this Debenture to any person to whom its rights under the Credit Agreement are assigned or transferred. 22. Miscellaneous 22.1 Exercise of rights If the Collateral Agent does not exercise a right or power when it is able to do so this will not prevent it exercising that right or power. When it does exercise a right or power it may do so again in the same or a different manner. The Collateral Agent's rights and remedies under this Debenture are in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have. Those other rights and remedies are not affected by this Debenture.
34 23. Currency Indemnity If, under any applicable law, whether pursuant to a judgment against XCE or the Dissolution of XCE or for any other reason, any payment under or in connection with this Debenture is made or falls to be satisfied in a currency (the "Other Currency") other than the currency in which the relevant payment is expressed to be payable (the "Required Currency"), then, to the extent that the payment actually received by the Collateral Agent (when converted into the Required Currency at the rate of exchange on the date of payment or, if it is not practicable for the Collateral Agent to make the conversion on that date, at the rate of exchange as soon afterwards as it is practicable for the Collateral Agent to do so or, in the case of a Dissolution, at the rate of exchange on the latest date permitted by applicable law for the determination of liabilities in such Dissolution) falls short of the amount expressed to be due or payable under or in connection with this Debenture, XCE shall, as an original and independent obligation under this Debenture, indemnify and hold the Collateral Agent harmless against the amount of such shortfall. For the purpose of this Clause 23, "rate of exchange" means the rate at which the Collateral Agent is able on the relevant date to purchase the Required Currency with the Other Currency and shall take into account any commission, premium and other costs of exchange and Taxes payable in connection with such purchase. 24. Certificate to Be Conclusive Evidence A copy of a certificate signed by an officer of the Collateral Agent as to the amount of any indebtedness comprised in the Secured Sums: (A) calculated in accordance with Section 2.08(e) of the Credit Agreement shall, in the absence of manifest error, be prima facie evidence; and (B) decided pursuant to any judgment against XCE shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive evidence for the purposes of any Proceedings, against XCE that such amount is in fact due and payable by XCE to the Collateral Agent. 25.

If the Mortgagee exercises any of its rights or remedies under this Mortgage, or if any actions or proceedings (including any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization proceedings) are commenced in which the Mortgagee is made a party and is obliged to defend or uphold or enforce this Mortgage or the rights of the Mortgagee hereunder or the terms of any Lease (and at such time an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing), or if a condemnation proceeding is instituted affecting the Mortgaged Property (and at such time an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing), the Mortgagor will pay all reasonable sums, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred by the Mortgagee related to the exercise of any remedy or right of the Mortgagee pursuant hereto and the reasonable expenses of any such action or proceeding together with all statutory or other costs, disbursements and allowances, interest thereon from the date of demand for payment thereof at the Post-Default Rate, and such sums and the interest thereon shall, to the extent permissible by law, be a Lien on the Mortgaged Property prior to any right, title to, interest in or claim upon the Mortgaged Property attaching or accruing subsequent to the recording of this Mortgage and shall be secured by this Mortgage to the extent permitted by law. Any payment of amounts due under this Mortgage not made on or before the due date for such payments (including any applicable notice and grace period) shall accrue interest daily without notice from the due date until paid at the Post-Default Rate, and such interest at the Post-Default Rate shall be immediately due upon demand by the Mortgagee. 19
ARTICLE 3 Insurance, Casualty and Condemnation Section 3.01. Insurance. (a) The Mortgagor shall maintain in full force and effect Insurance Policies with respect to the Property as required by Section 5.07 of the Credit Agreement. (b) If at any time the area in which any Improvement is located is designated a "flood hazard area" in any Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency), the Mortgagor shall obtain flood insurance in such total amount as the Mortgagee may from time to time reasonably require, and otherwise comply with the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended from time to time. As of the date hereof, the Mortgagee acknowledges that the Improvements are not located in a "flood hazard area." Section 3.02. Casualty. The Mortgagor represents and warrants that, as of the date hereof, there is no material Casualty affecting the Property. Section 3.03. Insurance Proceeds. Any Insurance Proceeds received by the Mortgagor shall be collected and applied in accordance with Section 2.10(b)(iii) of the Credit Agreement and Section 14 of the Security Agreement. Section 3.04. Condemnation. The Mortgagor represents and warrants that, as of the date hereof, (i) it has not received any written notice of any Condemnation affecting the Property, (ii) to the knowledge of the appropriate property management personnel of the Mortgagor, there are no negotiations or proceedings which might result in such a Condemnation, and (iii) to the knowledge of the appropriate property management personnel of the Mortgagor, no such Condemnation is proposed or threatened. Section 3.05. Condemnation Awards. Any Award received by the Mortgagor shall be collected and applied in accordance with Section 2.10(b)(iii) of the Credit Agreement and Section 14 of the Security Agreement. 20
ARTICLE 4 Certain Secured Obligations Section 4.01. Maximum Amount of Indebtedness. The maximum aggregate principal amount of indebtedness that is, or under any contingency may be, secured by this Mortgage (including a Borrower's obligation to reimburse advances made by any Lender following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default), either at execution or at any time thereafter, shall not exceed the Secured Loan Amount, plus, to the extent permissible under Applicable Law, amounts that Mortgagee expends after an Event of Default under this Mortgage to the extent that any such amounts shall constitute payment of (i) taxes, charges or assessments that may be imposed by law upon any Mortgaged Property; (ii) premiums on insurance policies covering any Mortgaged Property; (iii expenses incurred in upholding the Lien of this Mortgage, including the expenses of any litigation to prosecute or defend the rights and Lien created by this Mortgage; or (iv) any amount, cost or charge to which Mortgagee becomes subrogated, upon payment, whether under recognized principles of law or equity, or under express statutory authority; then, and in each such event, such amounts or costs, together with interest thereon, shall be added to the indebtedness secured hereby and shall be secured by this Mortgage. Section 4.02. Treatment of Borrowing and Repayments. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the amount of the Secured Obligations may increase and decrease from time to time as Lenders advance, Borrowers repay, and Lenders readvance sums on account of the Secured Obligations, all as more fully described in the Credit Agreement; provided that, as more fully described in the Credit Agreement, the Term Loans under the Credit Agreement may not be reborrowed after they are repaid. For purposes of this Mortgage, so long as the unpaid balance of the Secured Obligations equal or exceed the Secured Loan Amount, the amount of the Secured Obligations secured by this Mortgage shall at all times equal only the Secured Loan Amount as more fully described in Section 4.01. Such Secured Loan Amount represents only a portion of the first sums advanced by Lenders with respect to the Secured Obligations. Section 4.03. Reduction of Secured Loan Amount. The Secured Loan Amount shall be reduced only by the last and final sums that Borrowers repay with respect to the Secured Obligations and shall not be reduced by any intervening repayments of the Secured Obligations by Borrowers. As of the Effective Date, the total amount of the Secured Obligations exceeds the Secured Loan Amount, so that the Secured Loan Amount represents only a portion of the Secured Obligations actually outstanding. 21
Section 4.04. Application of Payments and Repayments. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Domestic Security Document to the contrary, so long as the balance of the Secured Obligations exceeds the Secured Loan Amount, any payments and repayments of any Secured Obligation by any Borrower shall not be deemed to be applied against, or to reduce, the portion of the Secured Obligations secured by this Mortgage, as more fully described in Section 4.01. Such payments shall instead be deemed to reduce only such portions of the Secured Obligations as are secured by mortgages encumbering real property located outside the State of New York, which mortgages secure the entire Secured Obligations (except to the extent, if any, that specific mortgages in such states contain specific limitations on the amount secured). Section 4.05. Limitation on Prepayment; Effect of Excessive Prepayment. In the event the aggregate unpaid balance of the Secured Obligations is reduced (as provided in Sections 4.03 and 4.04) below the Secured Loan Amount this Mortgage shall not thereafter secure any further advances or readvances of Secured Obligations thereafter made pursuant to the Credit Agreement unless and until an additional instrument which evidences such further advances or readvances, if any, is recorded in the Office of the County Clerk of the county or counties of New York in which the Mortgaged Property is located and any mortgage recording taxes payable with respect to such instrument and/or such further advances or readvances are paid. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the aggregate unpaid balance of the Secured Obligations is reduced (as provided in Sections 4.03 and 4.04) below the Secured Loan Amount and a Borrower thereafter requests further advances or readvances, the Mortgagor shall execute, acknowledge and record such an instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Mortgagee and pay any additional mortgage recording taxes attributable thereto and/or to such further advances or readvances. Section 4.06. No Limitation on Certain Rights. Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs relating to the Secured Loan Amount and treatment of payments, repayments, advances and readvances shall be deemed or construed to: (i) prevent Borrowers from fully prepaying the Loans in accordance with the Credit Agreement; (ii) prevent Borrowers from obtaining the release of the Mortgaged Property to the extent otherwise provided for in the Loan Documents; or (iii) limit or impair any Lender's remedies, including any Lender's right to require repayment of the Loans (as more fully described in the Credit Agreement) upon an Event of Default. Section 4.07. Right to Perform Obligations. If an Event of Default arises as a result of the failure by Mortgagor to pay or perform any of its obligations under Section 2.03 or if an Actionable Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing or upon an acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of 22
the Credit Agreement, the Mortgagee shall have the right, (i) with simultaneous notice if such payment or performance is necessary in the reasonable opinion of the Mortgagee to preserve the Mortgagee's rights under this Mortgage or with respect to the Mortgaged Property, or (ii) after notice given reasonably in advance to allow the Mortgagor an opportunity to cure, to pay or perform such obligation, provided the Mortgagor is not contesting payment or performance in accordance with the Credit Agreement, and further provided that no such payment or performance shall be construed to be a cure of any Default or waiver of any Default or Secured Obligation. If pursuant to this Section 4.07, the Mortgagee shall make any payment on behalf of the Mortgagor or shall incur hereunder any expense for which the Mortgagee is entitled to reimbursement pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents, such Secured Obligation shall be repayable on demand and shall bear interest from the date incurred at the Post-Default Rate. Such interest, and any other interest on the Secured Obligations payable at the Post-Default Rate pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents, shall accrue through the date paid notwithstanding any intervening judgment of foreclosure or sale. All such interest shall be part of the Secured Obligations and shall be secured by this Mortgage. Section 4.08. Changes in the Laws Regarding Taxation. If after the date hereof there is enacted any Applicable Law deducting from the value of the Property for the purpose of taxation the Lien of any Security Document or changing in any way the Applicable Law for the taxation of mortgages, deeds of trust or other Liens or obligations secured thereby, or the manner of collection of such taxes, so as to adversely affect this Mortgage, the CA Secured Obligations, or any Secured Party holding CA Secured Obligations, upon demand by the Mortgagee or any other affected Secured Party holding CA Secured Obligations and to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Mortgagor shall pay all taxes, assessments or other charges resulting therefrom or shall reimburse such Secured Party for all such taxes, assessments or other charges which such Secured Party is obligated to pay as a result thereof. Section 4.09. Indemnification. The Mortgagor shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee, arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, (a) the Mortgagee's exercise of any of its rights and remedies hereunder; (b) any accident, injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property occurring in, on or about the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof or on the adjoining sidewalks, curbs, adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, street or ways (other than to the extent the same may occur from and after ownership and possession of the Mortgaged Property is transferred to a purchaser at a foreclosure 23
sale or otherwise); and (c) any other conduct or misconduct of the Mortgagor, any lessee or other occupant of any of the Mortgaged Property, or any of their respective agents, contractors, subcontractors, servants, employees, licensees or invitees (other than to the extent the same may occur from and after ownership and possession of the Mortgaged Property is transferred to a purchaser at a foreclosure sale or otherwise); provided, however, such indemnity shall not be available to any Indemnitee to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and unappealable judgment to have resulted from such Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any amount payable under this Section will be payable on demand, be deemed a CA Secured Obligation and will bear interest pursuant to Section 4.07. The obligations of the Mortgagor under this Section shall survive the release of this Mortgage. ARTICLE 5 Defaults, Remedies and Rights Section 5.01. Events of Default. (a) Any Event of Default under the Credit Agreement shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder. (b) All notice and cure periods provided in the Credit Agreement shall run concurrently with any notice or cure periods provided under Applicable Law. Section 5.02. Remedies. (a) Upon an acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Mortgagee shall have the right and power to exercise any of the following remedies and rights, subject to mandatory provisions of Applicable Law, to wit: (i) to institute a proceeding or proceedings, by advertisement judicial process or otherwise as provided under Applicable Law, for the complete or partial foreclosure of this Mortgage or the complete or partial sale of the Mortgaged Property under the power of sale hereunder or under any Applicable Law; or (ii) to sell the Mortgaged Property, and all estate, right, title, interest, claim and demand of the Mortgagor therein and thereto, and all rights of redemption thereof, at one or more sales, as an entirety or in parcels, with such elements of real or personal property, at such time and place and upon such terms as the Mortgagee may deem expedient or as may be required under Applicable Law, and in the event of a sale hereunder or under any Applicable Law of less than all of the Mortgaged Property, 24
this Mortgage shall continue as a Lien on the remaining Mortgaged Property; or (iii) to institute a suit, action or proceeding for the specific performance of any of the provisions of this Mortgage; or (iv) to be entitled to the appointment of a receiver, supervisor, trustee, liquidator, conservator or other custodian (a "Receiver") of the Mortgaged Property, without notice to Mortgagor, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as a matter of right and without regard to, or the necessity to disprove, the adequacy of the security for the Secured Obligations or the solvency of the Mortgagor or any other Borrower, and the Mortgagor hereby, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, irrevocably waives such necessity and consents to such appointment, without notice, said appointee to be vested with the fullest powers permitted under Applicable Law, including to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law those under Section 5.02(a)(v); or (v) to enter upon the Property, by the Mortgagee or a Receiver (whichever is the Person exercising the rights under this clause), and, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, exclude the Mortgagor and its managers, employees, contractors, agents and other representatives therefrom in accordance with Applicable Law, without liability for trespass, damages or otherwise, and take possession of all other Mortgaged Property and all books, records and accounts relating thereto, and upon demand the Mortgagor shall surrender possession of the Property, the other Mortgaged Property and such books, records and accounts to the Person exercising the rights under this clause; and having and holding the same, the Person exercising the rights under this clause may use, operate, manage, preserve, control and otherwise deal therewith and conduct the business thereof, either personally or by its managers, employees, contractors, agents or other representatives, without interference from the Mortgagor or its managers, employees, contractors, agents and other representatives; and, upon each such entry and from time to time thereafter, at the expense of the Mortgagor and the Mortgaged Property, without interference by the Mortgagor or its managers, employees, contractors, agents and other representatives, the Person exercising the rights under this clause may, as such Person deems expedient, (A) insure or reinsure the Property, (B) make all necessary or proper repairs, renewals, replacements, alterations, additions, Restorations, betterments and improvements to the Property and (C) in such Person's own name or, at the option of such Person, in the Mortgagor's name, exercise all rights, powers and privileges of the Mortgagor with respect to the Mortgaged 25
Property, including the right to enter into Leases with respect to the Property, including Leases extending beyond the time of possession by the Person exercising the rights under this clause; and the Person exercising the rights under this clause shall not be liable to account for any action taken hereunder, other than for Rents actually received by such Person, and shall not be liable for any loss sustained by the Mortgagor resulting from any failure to let the Property or from any other act or omission of such Person, except to the extent such loss is caused by such Person's own willful misconduct or gross negligence; or (vi) with or, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law without entry upon the Property, in the name of the Mortgagee or a Receiver (as required by law and whichever is the Person exercising the rights under this clause) or, at such Person's option, in the name of the Mortgagor, to collect, receive, sue for and recover all Rents and proceeds of or derived from the Mortgaged Property, and after deducting therefrom all costs, expenses and liabilities of every character incurred by the Person exercising the rights under this clause in collecting the same and in using, operating, managing, preserving and controlling the Mortgaged Property and otherwise in exercising the rights under Section 5.02(a)(v) or any other rights hereunder, including all amounts necessary to pay Impositions, Rents, Insurance Premiums and other costs, expenses and liabilities relating to the Property, as well as compensation for the services of such Person and its managers, employees, contractors, agents or other representatives, to apply the remainder as provided in Section 5.06; or (vii) to take any action with respect to any Mortgaged Property permitted under the UCC in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Domestic Security Agreement; or (viii) to take any other action, or pursue any other remedy or right, as the Mortgagee may have under Applicable Law, and the Mortgagor does hereby grant the same to the Mortgagee; or (ix) to exercise any rights and remedies pursuant to Article 14 of RPAPL entitled "Foreclosure of Mortgage by Power of Sale"; or (x) to declare all sums secured hereby to be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, notice of any kind, protest or notice of protest, all of which are expressly waived. (b) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, 26
(i) each remedy or right hereunder shall be in addition to, and not exclusive or in limitation of, any other remedy or right hereunder, under any other Loan Document or under Applicable Law; (ii) every remedy or right hereunder, under any other Loan Document or under Applicable Law may be exercised concurrently or independently and whenever and as often as deemed appropriate by the Mortgagee; (iii) no failure to exercise or delay in exercising any remedy or right hereunder, under any other Loan Document or under Applicable Law shall be construed as a waiver of any Default hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (iv) no waiver of, failure to exercise or delay in exercising any remedy or right hereunder, under any other Loan Document or under Applicable Law upon any Default hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be construed as a waiver of, or otherwise limit the exercise of, such remedy or right upon any other or subsequent Default hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (v) no single or partial exercise of any remedy or right hereunder, under any other Loan Document or under Applicable Law upon any Default hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall preclude or otherwise limit the exercise of any other remedy or right hereunder, under any other Loan Document or under Applicable Law upon such Default or upon any other or subsequent Default hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (vi) the acceptance by the Mortgagee or any other Secured Party of any payment less than the amount of the Secured Obligation in question shall be deemed to be an acceptance on account only and shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect thereto; and (vii) the acceptance by the Mortgagee or any other Secured Party of any payment of, or on account of, any Secured Obligation shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any Default hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to any other Secured Obligation. (c) If the Mortgagee has proceeded to enforce any remedy or right hereunder or with respect hereto by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, it may compromise, discontinue or abandon such proceeding for any reason without 27
notice to the Mortgagor or any other Person (other than other Secured Parties as may be required by the other Loan Documents or the ESOP Guarantee Agreements or the XCFI Indentures), and, in the event that any such proceeding shall be discontinued, abandoned or determined adversely for any reason, the Mortgagor and the Mortgagee shall retain and be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder with respect to the Mortgaged Property, subject to the Lien hereof except to the extent any such adverse determination specifically provides to the contrary. (d) For the purpose of carrying out any provisions of Section 2.01(c), 4.07, 5.02(a)(v), 5.02(a)(vi), 5.05 or 5.07 or any other provision hereunder authorizing the Mortgagee or any other Person to perform any action on behalf of the Mortgagor upon an Actionable Event of Default or upon an acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Mortgagor hereby irrevocably appoints the Mortgagee or a Receiver appointed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(vi) or such other Person (as the case may be as the Person appointed under this subsection) as the attorney-in-fact of the Mortgagor (with a power to substitute any other Person in its place as such attorney-in-fact) to act in the name of the Mortgagor or, at the option of the Person appointed to act under this subsection, in such Person's own name, to take the action authorized under Section 2.01(c), 4.07, 5.02(a)(v), 5.02(a)(vi), 5.05 or 5.07 or such other provision, and to execute, acknowledge and deliver any document in connection therewith or to take any other action incidental thereto as the Person appointed to act under this subsection shall deem appropriate in its discretion; and the Mortgagor hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs any other Person to rely and act on behalf of the foregoing appointment and a certificate of the Person appointed to act under this subsection that such Person is authorized to act under this subsection. Section 5.03. Waivers by the Mortgagor. To the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Mortgagor shall not assert, and hereby irrevocably waives, any right or defense the Mortgagor may have under any statute or rule of law or equity now or hereafter in effect relating to (i) appraisement, valuation, homestead exemption, extension, moratorium, stay, statute of limitations, redemption, marshalling of the Mortgaged Property or the other assets of the Mortgagor, sale of the Mortgaged Property in any order or notice of deficiency or intention to accelerate any Secured Obligation; (ii) impairment of any right of subrogation or reimbursement; (iii) any requirement that at any time any action must be taken against any other Person, any portion of the Mortgaged Property or any other asset of the Mortgagor or any other Person; (iv) any provision barring or limiting the right of the Mortgagee to sell any Mortgaged Property after any other sale of any other Mortgaged Property or any other action against the Mortgagor or any other Person; (v) any provision barring or limiting the recovery by the Mortgagee of a deficiency after any sale of the Mortgaged Property; (vi) any other 28
provision of Applicable Law which might defeat, limit or adversely affect any right or remedy of the Mortgagee or the holders of the Secured Obligations under or with respect to this Mortgage or any other Security Document as it relates to any Mortgaged Property; or (vii) the right of the Mortgagee to foreclose this Mortgage in its own name on behalf of all of the Secured Parties by judicial action as the real party in interest without the necessity of joining any other Secured Party. Section 5.04. Jurisdiction and Process. (a) To the extent permitted under Applicable Law, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Mortgage or any other Security Document as it relates to any Mortgaged Property, the Mortgagor irrevocably consents to (i) the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State in which the Property is located and irrevocably waives any defense or objection which it may now or hereafter have to the jurisdiction of such court or the venue of such court for or the convenience of such court as the forum for any such suit, action or proceeding, and (ii) the service of (A) any process in any such suit, action or proceeding, or (B) any notice relating to any sale, or the exercise of any other remedy by the Mortgagee hereunder by sending a copy of such process or notice by prepaid overnight courier or United States registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested to the Mortgagor at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 7.03, such service to be effective when received at the address specified or when delivery at such address is refused. (b) Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of the Mortgagee to bring any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Mortgage or any other Security Document in any court having jurisdiction under the provisions of any other Security Document or Applicable Law or to serve any process, notice of sale or other notice in any manner permitted by any other Security Document or Applicable Law. Section 5.05. Sales. Subject to Section 4.01 and 5.02(a) and except as otherwise provided herein, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, at the election of the Mortgagee, the following provisions shall apply to any sale of the Mortgaged Property hereunder, whether made pursuant to the power of sale hereunder, any judicial proceeding or any judgment or decree of foreclosure or sale or otherwise: (a) The Mortgagee or the court officer (whichever is the Person conducting any sale) may conduct any number of sales from time to time. The power of sale hereunder shall not be exhausted by any sale as to any part or parcel of the Mortgaged Property which is not sold, unless and until the Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full, and shall not be exhausted or impaired by any sale which is not completed or is defective. Any sale may be as a whole or in 29
part or parcels and as provided in Section 5.03, the Mortgagor has thereby waived its right to direct the order in which the Mortgaged Property or any part or parcel thereof is sold. (b) Any sale may be postponed or adjourned by public announcement at the time and place appointed for such sale or for such postponed or adjourned sale without further notice. (c) After each sale, the Person conducting such sale shall execute and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers at such sale a good and sufficient instrument or instruments granting, conveying, assigning and transferring all right, title and interest of the Mortgagor in and to the Mortgaged Property sold and shall receive the proceeds of such sale and apply the same as provided in Section 5.06. The Mortgagor hereby irrevocably appoints the Person conducting such sale as the attorney-in-fact of the Mortgagor (with full power to substitute any other Person in its place as such attorney-in-fact) to act in the name of the Mortgagor or, at the option of the Person conducting such sale, in such Person's own name, to make without warranty by such Person any conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of the Mortgaged Property sold, and to execute, acknowledge and deliver any instrument of conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery or other document in connection therewith or to take any other action incidental thereto, as the Person conducting such sale shall deem appropriate in its discretion; and the Mortgagor hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs any other Person to rely and act upon the foregoing appointment and a certificate of the Person conducting such sale that such Person is authorized to act hereunder. Nevertheless, upon the request of such attorney-in-fact the Mortgagor shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any documentation which such attorney-in-fact may reasonably require for the purpose of ratifying, confirming or effectuating the powers granted hereby or any such conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery by such attorney-in-fact. (d) Any statement of fact or other recital made in any instrument referred to in Section 5.05(c) given by the Person conducting any sale as to the nonpayment of any Secured Obligation, the occurrence of any Event of Default, the amount of the Secured Obligations due and payable, the request to the Mortgagee to sell, the notice of the time, place and terms of sale and of the Mortgaged Property to be sold having been duly given, the refusal, failure or inability of the Mortgagee to act, the appointment of any substitute or successor agent, any other act or thing having been duly done by the Mortgagor, the Mortgagee or any other such Person, shall be taken as conclusive and binding against all other Persons as evidence of the truth of the facts so stated or recited. The Person conducting any sale may appoint or delegate any other Person as agent to perform any act necessary or incident to such sale, including the posting of 30
notices and the conduct of such sale, but in the name and on behalf of the Person conducting such sale. (e) The receipt by the Person conducting any sale of the purchase money paid at such sale shall be sufficient discharge therefor to any purchaser of any Mortgaged Property sold, and no such purchaser, or its representatives, grantees or assigns, after paying such purchase price and receiving such receipt, shall be bound to see to the application of such purchase price or any part thereof upon or for any trust or purpose of this Mortgage or, in any manner whatsoever, be answerable for any loss, misapplication or nonapplication of any such purchase money or be bound to inquire as to the authorization, necessity, expediency or regularity of such sale. (f) Subject to mandatory provisions of Applicable Law, any sale shall operate to divest all of the estate, right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever, whether at law or in equity, of the Mortgagor in and to the Mortgaged Property sold, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against the Mortgagor and any and all Persons claiming such Mortgaged Property or any interest therein by, through or under the Mortgagor. (g) At any sale, the Mortgagee may bid for and acquire the Mortgaged Property sold and, in lieu of paying cash therefor, may make settlement for the purchase price by causing the Secured Parties to credit against the Secured Obligations, including the expenses of the sale and the cost of any enforcement proceeding hereunder, the amount of the bid made therefor to the extent necessary to satisfy such bid. (h) If the Mortgagor or any Person claiming by, through or under the Mortgagor shall transfer or fail to surrender possession of the Mortgaged Property, after the exercise by the Mortgagee of the Mortgagee's remedies under Section 5.02(a)(v) or after any sale of the Mortgaged Property pursuant hereto, then the Mortgagor or such Person shall be deemed a tenant at sufferance of the purchaser at such sale, subject to eviction by means of summary process for possession of land, or subject to any other right or remedy available hereunder or under Applicable Law. (i) Upon any sale, it shall not be necessary for the Person conducting such sale to have any Mortgaged Property being sold present or constructively in its possession. (j) If a sale hereunder shall be commenced by the Mortgagee, the Mortgagee may at any time before the sale abandon the sale, and may institute suit for the collection of the Secured Obligations or for the foreclosure of this 31
Mortgage; or if the Mortgagee should institute a suit for collection of the Secured Obligations or the foreclosure of this Mortgage, the Mortgagee may at any time before the entry of final judgment in said suit dismiss the same and sell the Mortgaged Property in accordance with the provisions of this Mortgage. Section 5.6. Proceeds. Subject to Section 4.01 and except as otherwise provided herein or required under Applicable Law, the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, the Mortgaged Property hereunder, whether made pursuant to the power of sale hereunder, any judicial proceeding or any judgment or decree of foreclosure or sale or otherwise shall be applied and paid in accordance with Section 14 of the Security Agreement. Section 5.7. Assignment of Leases. (a) Subject to paragraph 5.07(d) below, the assignments of the Leases and the Rents under Granting Clauses VI and VII are and shall be present, absolute and irrevocable assignments by the Mortgagor to the Mortgagee and, subject to the license to the Mortgagor under Section 5.07(b), the Mortgagee or a Receiver appointed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(iv) (as the case may be as the Person exercising the rights under this Section) shall have the absolute, immediate and continuing right to collect and receive all Rents now or hereafter, including during any period of redemption, accruing with respect to the Property. At the request of the Mortgagee or such Receiver, the Mortgagor shall promptly execute, acknowledge, deliver, record, register and file any additional general assignment of the Leases or specific assignment of any Lease which the Mortgagee or such Receiver may reasonably require from time to time (all in form and substance satisfactory to the Mortgagee or such Receiver) to effectuate, complete, perfect, continue or preserve the assignments of the Leases and the Rents under Granting Clauses VI and VII. Neither the acceptance hereof nor the exercise of the rights and remedies hereunder nor any other action on the part of the Mortgagee or any Person exercising the rights of the Mortgagee hereunder shall be construed to be an assumption by the Mortgagee or any such Person of, or to otherwise make the Mortgagee or such Person liable or responsible for, any of the obligations of the Mortgagor under or with respect to the Leases or for any Rent, Security Deposit or other amount delivered to the Mortgagor, provided that the Mortgagee or any such Person exercising the rights of the Mortgagee hereunder shall be accountable as provided in Section 5.07(c) for any Rents, Security Deposits or other amounts actually received by the Mortgagee or such Person, as the case may be. Neither the acceptance hereof nor the exercise of the rights and remedies hereunder nor any other action on the part of the Mortgagee or any Person exercising the rights of the Mortgagee hereunder shall be construed to obligate the Mortgagee or any such Person to take any action under or with respect to the Leases or with respect to the Property, to incur any expense or perform or discharge any duty or obligation under or with respect to the Leases or with respect to the Property, to 32
appear in or defend any action or proceeding relating to the Leases or the Property, to constitute the Mortgagee as a mortgagee in possession (unless the assignee hereunder actually enters and takes possession of the Property), or to be liable in any way for any injury or damage to person or property sustained by any Person in or about the Property other than to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Mortgagee or any Person exercising the rights of the Mortgagee hereunder. (b) Prior to the occurrence of an Actionable Event of Default or the acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Mortgagor shall have a license granted hereby to collect and receive all Rents and apply the same subject to the provisions of the Loan Documents. This license shall terminate, at the option of the Mortgagee, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Actionable Event of Default or upon an acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. (c) If an Actionable Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or upon an acceleration of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Mortgagee or a Receiver appointed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(iv) (as the case may be as the Person exercising the rights under this Section) shall have the right to terminate the license granted under Section 5.07(b) by notice to the Mortgagor and to exercise the rights and remedies provided under Sections 5.07(a), 5.02(a)(v), 5.02(a)(vi) or any Applicable Law.

Mortgagor agrees that the Lien of this Mortgage shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not in any manner be affected or impaired by any acts or omissions whatsoever of Mortgagee, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lien hereof shall not be impaired by any acceptance by the Mortgagee of any security for or guarantees of the Secured Obligations, or by any failure, neglect or omission on the part of Mortgagee to realize upon or protect any Secured Obligation or any collateral security therefor including the Other Mortgages. The Lien hereof shall not in any manner be impaired or affected by any release (except as to the property released), sale, pledge, surrender, compromise, settlement, renewal, extension, indulgence, alteration, changing, modification or disposition of any of the Secured Obligations or of any of the collateral security therefor, including the Other Mortgages or of any guarantee thereof, and, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Mortgagee may at its discretion foreclose, exercise any power of sale, or exercise any other remedy available to it under any or all of the Other Mortgages without first exercising or enforcing any of its rights and remedies hereunder. Such exercise of Mortgagee's rights and remedies under any or all of the Other Mortgages shall not in any 39
manner impair the indebtedness hereby secured or the Lien of this Mortgage and any exercise of the rights or remedies of Mortgagee hereunder shall not impair the Lien of any of the Other Mortgages or any of Mortgagee's rights and remedies thereunder. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Mortgagor specifically consents and agrees the Mortgagee may exercise its rights and remedies hereunder and under the Other Mortgages separately or concurrently and in any order that it may deem appropriate and waives any rights of subrogation. 40
