Item 5. Other Events. On April 11, 2002, Registrant reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to matters that had been under investigation by the SEC since June 2000. In connection with the settlement, Registrant agreed to restate its financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 1997 through 2000 and to undertake a review of its material internal controls and accounting policies. Registrant also restated its consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of 2001. The restated consolidated financial statements were filed with the SEC in Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended December 31, 2001 ("2001 Form 10-K Report") and Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2002 ("March 2002 Form 10-Q Report"). The restated consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments which are corrections of errors made in the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include (i) adjustments related to the application of the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 "Accounting for Leases" and (ii) adjustments that arose as a result of other errors in the application of GAAP. All dollar and per share amounts have been revised, as appropriate for the effects of such restatement.
