Item 5. Other Events. On April 11, 2002, Registrant reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to matters that had been under investigation by the SEC since June 2000. In connection with the settlement, Registrant agreed to restate its consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 1997 through 2000 and to undertake a review of its material internal controls and accounting policies. Registrant also restated its consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of 2001. The restated consolidated financial statements were filed with the SEC in Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended December 31, 2001 ("2001 Form 10-K Report") and Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2002 ("March 2002 Form 10-Q Report"). The restated consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments which are corrections of errors made in the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include (i) adjustments related to the application of the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 "Accounting for Leases" and (ii) adjustments that arose as a result of other errors in the application of GAAP. All dollar and per share amounts have been revised, as appropriate for the effects of such restatement. This Current Report on Form 8-K provides the complete unaudited consolidated statements of operations and other selected financial data for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 2001 which is supplemental to the financial data contained in Registrant's 2001 Form 10-K Report and Registrant's March 2002 Form 10-Q Report. This Current Report on Form 8-K also supplements and corrects Registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 11, 2002, in which the 2001 quarterly data shown on the line entitled "Other expenses, net" has been adjusted to the amounts shown below. FOUR QUARTERS IN REVIEW Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Selected Financial Data (Unaudited) In millions, except per-share data
(1) The first through fourth quarters include inventory charges of $0, $24, $5 and $13, respectively associated with restructuring actions. These are in addition to all other inventory charges occurring in the applicable period. (2) Third quarter 2001 interest expense includes a net gain of $46 from the mark-to-market valuation of interest rate swaps required to be recorded as a result of applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 "Derivatives and Hedging" (SFAS No. 133) accounting rules. Similarly, fourth quarter 2001 interest expense reflects a net loss of $17 from the mark-to-market valuation of interest rate swaps in accordance with SFAS No. 133 accounting rules. The overall decline in interest expense beginning in the third quarter 2001 primarily reflects lower interest rates as compared to prior periods. (3) The first through fourth quarters include bad debt expense of $84, $93, $151 and $110, respectively. (4) Accrued dividends on ESOP preferred stock are deducted from net income (loss) in determining net income (loss) available to common shareholders which is used in the earnings per share calculation.
