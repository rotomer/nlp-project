The error, which was identified by Registrant and occurred with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 in January 2001, resulted in an after-tax understatement of interest expense of approximately $5 million to $6 million or less than 1 cent per share in each of the four quarters of 2001 and for the first three quarters of 2002. To adjust for these items, Registrant will restate its 2001 financial statements and revise 2002 quarterly financial information. The restated financial statements are expected to be filed next month. ____________________________________________________________________________ SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Registrant has duly authorized this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned duly authorized.
