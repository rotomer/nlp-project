Other Events. Registrant set pricing after the close of market on June 19, 2003 on the issuance of new common stock, mandatory convertible preferred stock and senior unsecured notes. Registrant also said that it finalized the terms of a new revolving credit facility. Upon the closing of these transactions, Registrant will complete its recapitalization plan announced earlier this month. This financing will de- lever the balance sheet and extend debt maturities, providing Registrant with additional operating and financial flexibility. Registrant will issue approximately 40 million shares of common stock at $10.25 per share and will issue 8 million shares of 3-year mandatory convertible preferred stock at $100 per share. The mandatory convertible preferred stock will have a dividend yield of $6.25 per share and a conversion premium of 20 percent over the common stock offering price of $10.25 per share. Registrant will also issue $700 million of 7-year senior unsecured notes due 2010 and bearing interest at 7-1/8 percent. In addition, $550 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes due 2013 will be issued, bearing interest at 7-5/8 percent. Registrant noted that the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the senior unsecured notes were oversubscribed from initial expectations due to strong demand. Also on June 19, 2003 Registrant entered into an agreement with Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and UBS for a new $1 billion credit facility consisting of a $700 million revolving facility and a $300 million term loan, both maturing in September 2008. This new credit facility, which is expected to close on June 25, becomes effective upon successful completion of Registrant's common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings.
