(c)  the prospectus supplement, dated June 19, 2003, relating to the offering of the Securities;

Finance Committee of the Company, adopted on June 19, 2003, in each case relating to, among other things, the issuance of the Securities.
 
We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.
 
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. In rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed that the Company has received the entire amount of the consideration contemplated by the resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing the issuance of the Securities. In addition, in rendering the opinions set forth below, we draw your attention to Section 630 of the New York Business Corporation Law (the "NYBCL"), which may impose certain liabilities on certain shareholders of New York corporations that have no shares listed on a national securities exchange or regularly quoted in an over-the-counter market. Section 630 of the NYBCL does not presently apply to the Company, and we have assumed that such section will continue to be inapplicable to the Company. We note that the Company has issued the Securities and proposes to issue the Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Securities pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment, in uncertificated form. We note that Section 508 of the NYBCL requires the Company within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated shares to send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 508. We assume that the Company will comply with such requirement. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and of public officials and others.
 
We do not express any opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York and we do not express any opinion as to the effect of any other laws on the opinion stated herein. The opinions expressed herein are based on laws in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.  the issuance and sale of the Securities has been duly authorized, and the Securities are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; and
 
2.  the issuance of shares of Common Stock of the Company initially issuable upon conversion of the Securities pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment has been authorized and, when issued upon conversion of the Securities in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Amendment, such shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
