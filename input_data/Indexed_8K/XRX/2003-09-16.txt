Other Events.
 
A.    
Funding of U.S. Pension Plans
 
Registrant accelerated funding to its U.S. pension plans by contributing $450 million to its plans on September 15, 2003. The contribution represents an increase of about $325 million from what was initially scheduled for 2003.
 
Registrant's strong operating cash flow$841 million for the first half of the yearand the success of its recent $3.6 billion recapitalization, which included the sale of stock and notes, provided Registrant with the financial flexibility to accelerate its pension funding. At the end of the second quarter, Registrant's cash position was $2.3 billion.
 
Registrant noted that its U.S. pension plans for the most recently completed plan year are now well over 100 percent funded on a current liability basis under government funding rules.
 
By making this $450 million contribution, Registrant substantially reduces its cash funding requirements for its U.S. pension plans in 2004.
 
 
B.    
Litigation Update
 
Reference is made to Note 10 "Litigation, Regulatory Matters and Other Contingencies" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2003. There has been a development in the case. On September 15, 2003, the Court of Appeals rejected RIGP's petition for a rehearing. RIGP is evaluating its options for further appeal.
