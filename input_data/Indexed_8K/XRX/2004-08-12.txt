On August 10, 2004, Registrant announced the completion of a $500,000,000 offering of senior unsecured notes due 2011 and bearing interest of 6.875 percent. Registrant stated that the offering exceeded the company's initial expectations. Registrant also announced that Moody's Investors Service raised its rating of Registrant's senior unsecured debt two notches from B1 to Ba2, reflecting continued confidence in Registrant's operational performance and strong financial results.
 
"The strength of our business  from a growing portfolio of leading products and services to a well executed business model that generates significant operating cash flow  is winning the confidence of and creating value for our stakeholders," said Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Registrant's senior vice president and chief financial officer. "This upgrade from Moody's and the positive interest from investors are evidence that Xerox is delivering on all fronts and poised for continued success." Zimmerman added that Registrant's financial position gives the company flexibility to access the markets on an opportunistic basis, like taking advantage of favorable conditions to lock in attractive long-term interest rates as it did with the recent senior note offering.
 
Last month Registrant reported second-quarter earnings of 21 cents per share, exceeding its expectations, and raised full-year earnings expectations to 80-84 cents per share. In the first half of the year, it generated operating cash flow of about $500,000,000 after contributing about $250,000,000 to pension plans. Registrant said it remains on track to generate $1.5 billion of operating cash flow for the full year.
 
Reference is made to a Registration Statement of the Registrant on Form S-3 (Registration Nos. 333-111623, 333-111623-01 and 333-111623-02), filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on December 30, 2003 and declared effective on February 3, 2004 (the "Registration Statement").
 
On August 10, 2004, the Registrant offered and sold $500,000,000 6

Description of the Notes, Guarantees and the Indenture

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Guarantors) is (a) in violation of its charter or by-laws or (b) in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary is subject (collectively, "Agreements and Instruments"), except, in the case of clause (b), for such defaults that have not and would not result in a Material Adverse
Absence of Defaults and Conflicts
 
Effect; and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Notes and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Notes and the Guarantees) and compliance by the Company and the Guarantors with its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event (as defined below) under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, the Agreements and Instruments (except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect), nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of (A) the charter or by-laws of the Company or any Subsidiary or (B) any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their assets, properties or operations except for such violations, in the case of clause (B) only, that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. As used herein, a "Repayment Event" means any event or condition which gives the holder of any note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness (or any person acting on such holder's behalf) the right to require the repurchase, redemption or repayment of all or a portion of such indebtedness by the Company or any Subsidiary.

No labor dispute with the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary exists or, to the knowledge of the Company, is imminent, and the Company is not aware of any existing or imminent labor disturbance by the employees of any of its or any Subsidiary's principal suppliers, manufacturers, customers or contractors, which, in either case, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Absence of Labor Dispute
 
(xvi) . There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, now pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary, which would be required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or the performance by the Company and the Guarantors of its obligations hereunder; the aggregate of all pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or of which any of their respective property or assets is the subject which are not described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Absence of Proceedings
 
(xvii) . All of the descriptions of contracts or other documents contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus are accurate and complete descriptions in all material respects of such contracts or other documents.
Accuracy of Descriptions
 
(xviii) .

Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or is otherwise aware of any infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any Intellectual Property or of any facts or circumstances which would render any Intellectual Property invalid or inadequate to protect the interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries therein, and which infringement or conflict (if the subject of any unfavorable decision, ruling or finding) or invalidity or inadequacy, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Possession of Intellectual Property
 
(xix) . No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency is necessary or required in connection with the offering of the Notes and the Guarantees, the issuance and sale of the Notes and the Guarantees, the due authorization, execution or delivery by the Company and the Guarantors of their respective obligations under any of the Operative Agreements to which it is a party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (A) such as have been already obtained and (B) such as may be required under state or foreign securities or "blue sky" laws or under the rules and regulations of the National Association of Securities Dealers (the "NASD").

(xx) . The Company and its Subsidiaries possess such permits, licenses, approvals, consents and other authorizations (collectively, "Governmental Licenses") issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory agencies or bodies necessary to conduct the business now operated by them, except where the failure to possess such Governmental Licenses would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental Licenses, except where the failure so to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; all of the Governmental Licenses held are valid and in full force and effect, except when the invalidity of such Governmental Licenses or the failure of such Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such Governmental Licenses which, individually or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Possession of Licenses and Permits
 
(xxi) . The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all material real property owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries and good title to all other material properties owned by them, in each case, free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions or encumbrances ("Encumbrances") of any kind except such as (A) are described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or (B) do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect the value of such
Title to Property
 
property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (C) where failure to have such good and marketable title or to be free of such Encumbrances would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and all of the leases and subleases material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, and under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds properties described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, are in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any notice of any claim of any sort that has been asserted by anyone adverse to the rights of the Company or any Subsidiary under any of the leases or subleases mentioned above, or affecting or questioning the rights of the Company or such Subsidiary to the continued possession of the leased or subleased premises under any such lease or sublease, except for any such claim as would not, individually or in the aggregate with any other such claims, have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(xxii) . The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have filed all necessary federal, state and foreign income and franchise tax returns or have properly requested extensions thereof and have paid all taxes required to be paid by any of them and, if due and payable, any related or similar assessment, fine or penalty levied against any of them except as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings. The Company has made adequate charges, accruals and reserves in the applicable financial statements referred to in Section 1(a)(iv) hereof in respect of all federal, state and foreign income and franchise taxes for all periods to which the tax liability of the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries has not been finally determined.
Tax Law Compliance
 
(xxiii) . The Company maintains on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries a system of accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (A) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization, (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets, (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization and (D) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
Company's Accounting System
 
(xxiv) . The Company is not and, after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the Notes as herein contemplated and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus, will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").
Investment Company Act
 
(xxv) . Except as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect, (A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, policy or rule of common law or any judicial or administrative interpretation thereof, including any judicial or administrative order, consent, decree or judgment, relating to pollution or protection of human health, the environment (including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface or subsurface strata) or wildlife, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to the release or threatened release of chemicals, pollutants, contaminants,
Environmental Laws
 
wastes, toxic substances, hazardous substances, petroleum or petroleum products (collectively, "Hazardous Materials") or to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), (B) the Company and its Subsidiaries have all permits, authorizations and approvals required under any applicable Environmental Laws and are each in compliance with their requirements, (C) there are no pending or threatened administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, demands, demand letters, claims, liens, notices of noncompliance or violation, investigation or proceedings relating to any Environmental Law against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (D) there are no events or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to form the basis of an order for clean-up or remediation, or an action, suit or proceeding by any private party or governmental body or agency, against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to Hazardous Materials or the violation of any Environmental Laws.
 
(xxvi) . The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed so that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities; the Company's auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have been advised of: (i) any significant deficiencies and material weakness in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

Controls and Procedures

Except as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all presently applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder ("ERISA"). No "reportable event" (as defined in ERISA) has occurred with respect to any "pension plan" (as defined in ERISA) for which the Company would reasonably be expected to have any liability; the Company has not incurred and does not expect to incur material liability under (x) Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or withdrawal from, any "pension plan" or (y) Sections 412 or 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including regulations and published interpretations thereunder (the "Code"); and each "pension plan" for which the Company would have any liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
ERISA Matters
 
Code has received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that it is so qualified and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which is reasonably likely to cause the loss of such qualification.
 
(b) . Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Guarantors) delivered to the Underwriters or to counsel for the Underwriters shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company or such Guarantor to the Underwriters as to the matters covered thereby.

Securities
Schedule A
 
(b) . Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of certificates for, the Securities shall be made at the offices of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, New York, New York 10005 or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Underwriters and the Company, at 9:00 A.M. (Eastern time) on the third business day after the date hereof (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 hereof), or such other time not later than ten business days after such date as shall be agreed upon by the Underwriters and the Company (such time and date of payment and delivery being herein called the "Closing Time").
Payment
 
Payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Company, against delivery to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Notes to be purchased by them. It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized Citigroup Global Markets Inc., for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for, the Securities which it has severally agreed to purchase.

The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus, and any amendments and supplements thereto required pursuant hereto, by the Underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities.
Delivery of Prospectus
 
(b) . The Company will immediately notify the Underwriters, and confirm such notice in writing, of (i) any filing made by the Company of information relating to the offering of the Notes with any securities exchange or any other securities regulatory body in the United States or any other jurisdiction, (ii) the issuance by the Commission or any state securities commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, qualification or exemption from qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction designated by the Representatives pursuant to Section 3(d) hereof, or the initiation of any proceeding by the Commission or any state securities commission or any other federal or state regulatory authority for such purpose and (iii) the happening, during the period referred to in Section 3(c)(iii) hereof, of any material change or any development involving a prospective material change in or affecting the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the results of operations or business affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries which (A) make any statement in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus false or misleading in any material respect or (B) if not disclosed in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, would constitute a material omission therefrom. In such event, or if during such time any event shall occur as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, its counsel, the Underwriters or counsel for the Underwriters, to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, the Company and the Guarantors will forthwith amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus by preparing and furnishing to the Underwriters an amendment or amendments of, or a supplement or supplements to, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (in form and substance satisfactory in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Underwriters) so that, as so amended or supplemented, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading. The Company and the Guarantors shall use their best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the qualification or exemption of the Securities by the Commission or under any federal or state securities or "blue sky" laws and, if at any time the Commission or any state securities commission or other federal or state regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the qualification or exemption of the Securities under any federal or state securities or "blue sky" laws, the Company and the Guarantors shall use their best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time.
Notice and Effect of Material Events
 
(c) . The Company will advise the Underwriters promptly, and, if requested by the Representatives, will confirm such advice in writing (i) if it is necessary for any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to be declared effective before the offering of the Securities may commence, (ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information with respect thereto, or of notice of institution of proceedings for, or the entry of a stop order, suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and, (iii) during such period as a prospectus is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with the offering and sale of the Notes by the Underwriters, (A) of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, including by filing any documents that would be incorporated therein by reference and (B) if any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or, if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus to comply with the Act. The Company will provide the Underwriters and their counsel copies of any such documents for review and comment a reasonable amount of time prior to any proposed filing and to file no such amendment or supplement to which the Underwriters may reasonably object in writing.
Amendments and Supplements
 
The Company will endeavor to cause any necessary post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to become effective as soon as reasonably possible and will promptly notify the Underwriters, and if requested by the Representatives, confirm such advice in writing, when such post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective. If action is required due to a condition described by clause (iii) of the immediately preceding paragraph, subject to such paragraph, the Company shall (A) forthwith prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or Prospectus so that the statements therein, as so amended or supplemented, will not, in the light of the circumstances in which they are made, be misleading, or so that such Registration Statement or Prospectus will comply with applicable law, (B) prepare promptly upon the reasonable request of any of the Representatives, any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in the reasonable opinion of Underwriters' counsel is believed to be necessary under the Act, and (C) furnish to the Underwriters and such other persons as the Underwriters may designate such number of copies thereof as the Underwriters may reasonably request.
 
(d) . Each of the Company and the Guarantors will use its reasonable efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as the Underwriters may designate; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantors shall be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. In each jurisdiction in which the Securities have been so qualified, each of the Company and the Guarantors will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction to continue such qualification in effect for so long as may be required in connection with the distribution of the Securities.

(a) . The Company and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, its officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act to the extent and in the manner set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below:
Indemnification of Underwriters
 
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, resulting from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company becoming effective after the date of this Agreement) or in a Prospectus (the term Prospectus for the purpose of this Section 7 being deemed to include any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 7(c) hereof) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Underwriters), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
 
, , that (A) this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of an Underwriter to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
provided
however
 
furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in such Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) and (B) the Company shall not be liable to any indemnified party with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus (or supplement thereto) if (i) the Prospectus corrected any such untrue statement or omission, (ii) the Prospectus was delivered to such indemnified party (sufficiently in advance of the Closing Time and in sufficient quantity to allow for distribution by the Closing Time), (iii) the delivery of the Prospectus was required by the Act to be made to the applicable purchaser and (iv) such indemnified party failed to furnish a copy of the Prospectus (excluding any documents incorporated by reference therein) to the applicable purchaser.
 
(b) . Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantors, the directors and officers of the Company and the Guarantors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company and the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in any Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in such Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company) or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
Indemnification of the Company and the Guarantors
 
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the Company from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b) hereof, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. If it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and which counsel is reasonably acceptable to the indemnified parties' defendant in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them which are different from or in addition to those available to the Company. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
could be sought under this Section 7 or Section 8 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(a)(ii) hereof effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, unless the indemnifying party shall in good faith contest the reasonableness of such fees and expenses (but only to the extent so contested) or the entitlement of the indemnified person to indemnification under the terms of this Section 7.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
SECTION 8. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand, or by the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts or commissions received by it hereunder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter otherwise would have been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and the officers, directors and affiliates of each Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriters and each officer and director of the Company and the Guarantors and each person, if any, who controls the Company and the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective amount of Notes they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
SECTION 9. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company and any Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of the Notes to the Underwriters.

(b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 7, 8 and 9 hereof shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
 
SECTION 11. .

(b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date pursuant to this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section 11 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangement.
 
SECTION 12. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

% Senior Notes due 2011 (the "Notes") to be issued under the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 10, 2004 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantors (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") to an indenture, dated as of June 25, 2003 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee and as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 25, 2003 among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee (together with the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"). The Indenture provides that the Notes are to be guaranteed (the "Guarantees") by Xerox International Joint Marketing, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("XIJM"), and Intelligent Electronics, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("IEI" and, together with XIJM, the "Guarantors"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Indenture.
 
In that connection, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion, including the Indenture and the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration Nos. 333-111623, 333-111623-01 and 333-111623-02) (the "Registration Statement") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") relating to the registration under the Securities Act of various securities of the Company and guarantees of certain securities of the Company. As to various questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon representations of officers or directors of the Company and documents furnished to us by the Company without independent verification of their accuracy. We have also assumed (a) the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies and (b) that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represents a legal, valid and binding obligation of, the Trustee.
 
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes issued by the Company and the Guarantees issued by XIJM and, assuming for this purpose that the
laws of Pennsylvania are the same as the laws of New York, IEI have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and the Guarantors, respectively, and, when authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantors in accordance with their respective terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. We also consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission.
 
We are admitted to practice in the State of New York and we do not express any opinion with respect to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America.
