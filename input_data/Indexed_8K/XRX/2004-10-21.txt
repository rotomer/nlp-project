FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 21, 2004  Xerox Corporation (NYSE: XRX) announced today another quarter of improved earnings reflecting increased sales of industry-leading digital systems, demand for document services and continued operational excellence. The company reported third-quarter earnings per share of 17 cents including a 4-cent benefit from Xerox's share of a Fuji Xerox pension settlement gain, which was partially offset by restructuring charges of 2 cents per share.
 
"Xerox's innovative technology and service offerings - delivered through an expanding distribution system with a lean and flexible business model - continue to solidify our market leadership, driving consistently strong earnings performance," said Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer.
 
Equipment sales grew 5 percent in the third quarter including a currency benefit of 2 percentage points. Total revenue for the third quarter was flat year-over-year at $3.7 billion including a currency benefit of 3 percentage points. Revenue growth continued to be impacted by post-sale revenue declines from the company's older light-lens

technology and weak performance in Latin America. To drive growth in this region, the company is implementing a two-tier distribution channel across Latin America.
 
Third-quarter revenue from Xerox's targeted growth areas  office digital, production digital and value-added services  grew 7 percent year-over-year and now represents about 74 percent of the company's revenue.
 
Xerox continues to offer the industry's broadest portfolio of technology and services with 35 new products announced year to date. In the third quarter, Xerox launched the DocuColor 8000, an 80 page-per-minute digital color production press, and upgraded software offerings like FreeFlow and DocuShare that improve customers' productivity by simplifying workflow. Earlier this month Xerox announced a wave of 17 new products including 12 office products that set the industry standard for speed and functionality like the WorkCentre Pro C3545 multifunction system, a color system with speeds fastest in its class.
 
"Offered at competitive prices and integrated with value-added services, Xerox's technology investments continue to fuel growth with about two-thirds of all equipment sales in the third quarter coming from products launched in the past two years," said Mulcahy.
 
Revenue from color products grew 18 percent in the third quarter and is a key driver of Xerox's growth strategy as the increasing volume of pages printed on Xerox's color systems flows through to post-sale revenue. Color revenue represents 24 percent of Xerox's total revenue.
 
Leading with Services
 
Xerox is on track to deliver double-digit annual growth in Xerox Global Services, which offers consulting, imaging and content management for businesses small to large. Last month the company announced a $23 million document services contract with HSBC as well as a multimillion-dollar win with The Boeing Company that includes 5,000 Xerox multifunction systems, services and Web-based management software.

Earlier today Xerox announced a multimillion-dollar services contract with Sun Microsystems for Xerox to manage the entire fleet of Sun's document management devices across 119 sites in 31 European countries.
 
Driving the New Business of Printing
 
Through the company's production business, Xerox continues to lead the "new business of printing" by helping commercial printers and document-intensive industries complement offset printing with the more dynamic world of digital.
 
Production color installs grew 16 percent in the quarter largely due to the Xerox iGen3 digital color production press and DocuColor 5252 digital color systems. Installs of production monochrome products increased 8 percent primarily driven by demand for the company's Nuvera 100/120 copier/printer and the Xerox 2101 light production system.
 
Digitizing the Office
 
Installs of Xerox office monochrome systems were up 20 percent in the third quarter due to continued strong demand for desktop and office multifunction devices. Office color multifunction installs grew 19 percent and office color printing installs were up 40 percent driven by positive momentum from the Phaser line of solid ink and laser printers.
 
Gross margins remained strong at 41.3 percent in line with the company's full-year expectations. Selling, administrative and general expenses increased 1 percent including Olympic sponsorship expenses, incremental marketing investments and a 3-percentage point adverse impact of currency.
 
Xerox generated operating cash flow of $435 million in the third quarter contributing to a cash balance of $3.4 billion. Debt decreased $1 billion from the third quarter 2003.

Commenting on the balance of the year, Mulcahy said she expects fourth-quarter earnings in the range of 20-22 cents per share, contributing to full-year earnings in the range of 83-85 cents per share.

Financial Review
 
Summary
 
 
from the 2003 third quarter including a 3-percentage point benefit from currency. Equipment sales grew 5 percent in the third quarter 2004 reflecting a 2-percentage point benefit from currency as well as the success of our color and digital light production products. 2004 third quarter post sale and other revenue declined 2 percent from the 2003 third quarter as declines in older light lens technology products and developing market operations ("DMO"), driven by Latin America, were only partially offset by digital office and production growth as well as a 3-percentage point currency benefit. The DMO and light lens declines reflect a reduction of equipment at customer locations and related page volume declines. Finance income declined 6 percent, including a 3-percentage point benefit from currency.
Total third quarter 2004 revenues of $3.7 billion were essentially unchanged
 
Third quarter 2004 net income included after-tax restructuring charges of $16 million ($23 million pre-tax). In addition, about 60 percent of the $62 million 2004 third quarter equity income relates to our share of the gain recorded by Fuji Xerox as a result of the transfer and settlement of a portion of their pension obligation to the Japanese government. 2003 third quarter net income of $117 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, included after-tax restructuring charges of $7 million ($11 million pre-tax).
2004 third quarter net income was $163 million, or $0.17 per diluted share.
 
Operations Review
 
Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:
 
 
of $1,000 million in the third quarter 2004 increased 5 percent from $948 million in the third quarter 2003 reflecting significant color and light production growth as well as a 2-percentage point benefit from currency. Continued equipment sales growth reflects the success of numerous products launched during the last 2 years, as approximately two-thirds of the 2004 third quarter equipment sales were generated from these products. Color equipment sales continued to grow rapidly in the third quarter 2004 and represented about 30 percent of total equipment sales.
Equipment sales
 
2004 third quarter equipment sales grew 13 percent from the third quarter 2003 as install growth and favorable currency were only partially offset by the impact of product mix and very modest single-digit price declines. Color equipment sales growth reflects install growth and improved product mix, partially offset by low single digit price declines. Production monochrome equipment sales growth reflects strong Xerox 2101 and Nuvera 100 and 120 copier/printer install growth as well as favorable currency, which were only partially offset by a decline in high-end publishing and printing systems installs.
Production:
 
2004 third quarter equipment sales grew 6 percent from the 2003 third quarter as install growth and favorable currency were only partially offset by product mix and moderating price declines of about 5 percent. Product mix reflects an increased proportion of low-end equipment sales due to very strong growth in monochrome desktop multifunction devices ("Segment 1") and recently launched office printers.
Office:
 
DMO equipment sales consist primarily of Segment 1 devices and office printers. Equipment sales in the third quarter 2004 declined $3 million from the 2003 third quarter, as declines in Latin America were only partially offset by growth in geographies where we successfully operate a two-tiered distribution model, such as Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. During the 2004 third quarter, we continued our transition to a two-tiered distribution model in Latin America to expand market coverage.
DMO:
 
of $2,486 million declined 2 percent from the third quarter 2003 as a 3-percentage point benefit from currency only partially offset declines from lower equipment populations. Post sale revenue is largely a function of the equipment at customer locations, the volume of pages produced by our customers on that equipment, the proportion of color pages, and associated services. Third quarter 2004 supplies, paper and other sales of $652 million (included within post sale and other revenue) were comparable to the 2003 third quarter. Service, outsourcing and rental revenue of $1,834 million declined 3 percent from the 2003 third quarter as lower equipment populations and related page volumes more than offset benefits from currency.
Post sale and other revenues
 
2004 third quarter post sale and other revenue declined 2 percent as monochrome declines, driven primarily by lower page volumes, more than offset very strong color page growth and favorable currency.
Production:
 
2004 third quarter post sale and other revenue declined 2 percent as digital monochrome and color page growth as well as favorable currency only partially offset declines in older technology light lens products.
Office:
 
2004 third quarter post sale and other revenue declined 9 percent, primarily reflecting Latin America's rental equipment population declines. In response, we have continued our transition to a two-tiered distribution model which is intended to increase, over time, the sales of office devices and the associated supplies and service revenue.
DMO:
 
2004 third quarter post sale and other revenue increased 2 percent from the 2003 third quarter as the favorable impact of currency more than offset declines in SOHO supply sales following our 2001 exit from this business.

Key Ratios and Expenses
 
 
Third quarter 2004 of 41.3 percent increased 0.2 percentage points from the third quarter 2003 as productivity and cost improvements as well as other variances more than offset moderating price investments and product mix. in the 2004 third quarter increased 2.5 percentage points from the 2003 third quarter. Productivity and cost improvements net of price investments benefited sales gross margin by 0.8 percentage points and mix benefited sales gross margin by 0.8
total gross margin
Sales gross margin
 
percentage points. declined 1.4 percentage points from the third quarter 2003. Approximately half of the decline was due to DMO cost and expense reductions that have lagged install base and post sale revenue declines. Productivity actions were implemented in DMO in the 2004 third quarter. Cost improvements in other areas offset price investments. The balance of the decline primarily relates to mix.
Service, outsourcing and rentals gross margin
 
expense of $189 million was $18 million less than the third quarter 2003, primarily due to improved efficiencies as we capture benefits from our platform development strategy. We continue to invest in technological development, particularly in color, and believe our R&D spending is at an adequate level to remain technologically competitive. Xerox R&D remains strategically coordinated with that of Fuji Xerox.
Research and development (R&D)
 
expenses of $1,036 million in the 2004 third quarter increased by $8 million from the 2003 third quarter as general and administrative expense productivity and bad debt expense reductions were more than offset by an adverse currency impact of $30 million and substantial marketing investments. Marketing investments included Olympics spending of approximately $28 million. Third quarter 2004 bad debt expense of $21 million was $32 million lower than the third quarter 2003 reflecting improvements in collections performance, receivables aging and write-off trends.
Selling, administrative and general (SAG)
 
In the third quarter 2004, we recorded of $23 million primarily consisting of new severance actions in Latin America and Europe. The remaining restructuring reserve balance at September 30, 2004 for all restructuring programs was $132 million.
restructuring charges
 
Worldwide of 59,300 declined by 700 from the 2004 second quarter due to reductions attributable to our restructuring programs and attrition.
employment
 
for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:
Other expenses, net
 
 
Third quarter 2004 non-financing interest expense of $91 million was $36 million lower than the 2003 third quarter primarily due to lower average debt balances reflecting scheduled term debt repayments.
 
Third quarter 2004 interest income decreased $3 million compared to the third quarter 2003. The decline primarily reflects the absence of 2003 third quarter interest income of $9 million from certain state tax refunds partially offset by increased interest income resulting from increased cash balances and higher interest rates.
 
We recorded $20 million of currency losses in the third quarter 2004 compared to $12 million of currency losses in the third quarter 2003. The 2004 losses relate to the cost of hedging Euro and Yen denominated liabilities, as well as the mark to market of derivatives that are hedging the cost of future inventory purchases.
 
In the third quarter 2004, we recorded expense of $62 million compared with income tax expense of $38 million in the third quarter 2003. The effective tax rates for the third quarter 2004 and 2003 were 38.0 percent and 26.8 percent, respectively. The difference between the 2004 third quarter effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate relates primarily to losses in certain jurisdictions where we are not providing tax benefits and continue to maintain deferred tax valuation allowances. Partially offsetting this impact is the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions. The difference between the 2003 third quarter effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate relates primarily to favorable audit settlements in the U.S. and Europe.
income tax
 
Our effective tax rate will change based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for the 2004 fourth quarter will approximate 40 percent, bringing our 2004 annual effective tax rate to approximately 37 percent.
 
primarily reflects our 25 percent share of Fuji Xerox's net income. About 60 percent of the $62 million of third quarter 2004 equity in net income resulted from a pension settlement gain due to a non-recurring opportunity given to Japanese companies by the Japanese government in accordance with the Japan Welfare Pension Insurance Law. This law allowed Japanese companies to transfer a portion of their pension obligations to the Japanese government. Fuji Xerox completed this transfer and recognized a corresponding settlement gain in August 2004.

Segment Operating Profit
 
Total segment operating profit of $248 million in the third quarter 2004 improved $82 million from $166 million in the third quarter 2003. The 2004 third quarter total segment operating margin of 6.7 percent increased 2.3 percentage points from the 2003 third quarter primarily reflecting our share of the pension settlement gain from Fuji Xerox and disciplined cost and expense management.
 
Production operating profit was $58 million in the third quarter 2004 compared to $38 million in the third quarter 2003. The 2004 third quarter Production operating margin of 5.4 percent increased 1.8 percentage points from the 2003 third quarter primarily due to R&D efficiencies which were only partially offset by increased marketing investments.
Production:
 
Office operating profit was $182 million in the third quarter 2004 compared to $187 million in the third quarter 2003. The 2004 third quarter Office operating margin of 10.0 percent declined 0.3 percentage points from the 2003 third quarter primarily reflecting increased R&D and marketing investments which were partially offset by increased productivity and lower bad debt expense
Office:
.
 
DMO operating profit was $6 million in the third quarter 2004 compared to $28 million in the third quarter 2003. The decline primarily reflects the impacts from Latin America where revenue declines have not been matched with cost and expense reductions.
DMO:
 
Third quarter 2004 Other operating profit of $2 million improved $89 million from the third quarter 2003 primarily reflecting our share of the pension settlement gain from Fuji Xerox and lower non-financing interest expense.

Cash Flow Analysis
 
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 as reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:
 
 
Third quarter 2004 of $435 million increased $368 million from the 2003 third quarter. The increase primarily results from lower pension benefit plan contributions of $477 million, partially offset by increased inventory investments of $72 million primarily for new products and $56 million lower finance receivables portfolio run-off. The lower pension benefit plan contributions reflect our decision in the third quarter 2003 to accelerate and increase our funding levels; in 2004, a decision to accelerate funding occurred in the second quarter. The lower finance receivables reductions reflect the increase in 2004 equipment sales revenue.
cash flows from operating activities
 
of $18 million for the third quarter 2004 included capital expenditures and internal use software spending of $51 million partially offset by $25 million released from restricted cash. The third quarter 2003 primarily consisted of a $95 million decrease in restricted cash balances, partially offset by $57 million of capital and internal use software spending.
Cash usage from investing activities
 
of $416 million for the third quarter 2004 included $529 million of net cash proceeds on other debt which included $750 million of net proceeds from the newly issued Senior notes due 2011 and proceeds of $81 million from other short term borrowings, partially offset by scheduled payments on term and other debt of $302 million.
Cash flows from financing activities
 
Financing Activity
 
The following table compares finance receivables to financing related debt as of September 30, 2004:
 
 
 
 
Debt
 
In August 2004, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2011, at par value, and received net proceeds of approximately $492 million. In September 2004, we issued an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount Senior Notes due 2011, at 104.25 percent of par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $258 million. These notes form a single series of debt.
 
Our debt maturities for the remainder of 2004 and 2005 by quarter, and 2006, 2007, 2008 by year and thereafter are as follows:
