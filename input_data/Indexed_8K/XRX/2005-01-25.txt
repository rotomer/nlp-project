Exhibit A
 
 
 
 
 
STAMFORD, Conn., Jan. 25, 2005  Xerox Corporation (NYSE: XRX) today announced fourth-quarter 2004 earnings of 24 cents per share that reflect increased sales of industry-leading color technology, demand for document services and continued operational excellence.
 
"In 2004 Xerox announced 40 new products, accelerated the growth of Xerox Global Services by helping customers streamline work processes, and drove demand for our industry-leading color technology with the Xerox iGen3 digital color production press, DocuColor systems and Phaser solid ink printers," said Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer. "We're winning customers and beating the competition by delivering Smarter Document Management
SM
that reduces costs and improves productivity for businesses small to large.
 
"At the same time, we continue to strengthen our operations through a sharp focus on reducing costs and debt, generating significant operating cash flow and increasing shareholder value. The end result: we delivered another quarter  and another year  of earnings growth, driven by a rich product portfolio and a lean business model."
Xerox Fourth-Quarter 2004 Earnings Report / 2
 
Equipment sales grew about 3 percent in the fourth quarter and total revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2003. Both equipment sales and total revenue included a currency benefit of 3 percentage points.
 
The overall post-sale trend improved as the revenue stream from new digital systems and services partially offset declines from the company's older light lens technology and weak performance in Brazil, both of which significantly impacted total revenue. To drive growth in Brazil, the company continues its implementation of a two-tier distribution channel.
 
Fourth-quarter revenue from Xerox's targeted growth areas  office digital, production digital and value-added services  grew 5 percent year over year and now represents about 76 percent of the company's revenue.
 
Revenue from color products grew 21 percent in the fourth quarter and is a key driver of Xerox's growth strategy as the increasing volume of pages printed on Xerox's color systems flows through to post-sale revenue. Color revenue represents 27 percent of Xerox's total revenue, a year-over-year increase of 5 percentage points.
 
The company continues to deliver double-digit growth in Xerox Global Services, which offers consulting, imaging and content management. Increasingly, information technology companies are partnering with Xerox to integrate Xerox's expertise in document management with IT infrastructure services. Last month, Xerox and EDS announced a $40 million contract with Barclays Plc to manage Barclays' procurement, service, and helpdesk for more than 2,250 Xerox and other devices across nearly 200 Barclays Group office sites in the United Kingdom. Revenue from Xerox's value-added service offerings such as this grew 25 percent in the fourth quarter.

Through the company's production business, Xerox continues to lead the "new business of printing" by helping commercial printers and document-intensive industries complement offset printing with the more dynamic world of digital.
 
Production revenue was up 1 percent in the fourth quarter, largely due to a 10 percent increase in production equipment sales. Install activity in the fourth quarter was more heavily weighted toward higher-end digital color systems like the Xerox iGen3 and DocuColor 8000, which generate strong revenue and higher page volumes that flow through to future post-sale growth. As a result, production color installs were down 4 percent and install activity in production monochrome declined 9 percent. For production monochrome, the success of the Xerox Nuvera copier/printer light production system only partially offset declines from light lens as well as declines in production publishing. In this segment, activity was impacted by customers choosing to delay purchasing decisions until the North American launch of the Xerox Nuvera digital production system scheduled for next month.
 
Total revenue from Xerox's office business was flat with equipment sales down 1 percent in the fourth quarter largely due to product mix; the company sold a greater proportion of lower-priced desktop units compared to the fourth-quarter of 2003. However, install activity was strong with office color multifunction systems up 17 percent and office color printing installs up 135 percent driven by laser and solid ink printers. Installs of office monochrome products were up 6 percent reflecting strong placements of Xerox WorkCentre desktop multifunction systems.
 
Xerox continues to bolster its line-up of competitively priced office systems designed for workgroups of any size. In the fourth quarter, the company launched 12 new office products that set the industry standard for speed and functionality. Earlier this month, Xerox announced eight more products including two high-speed multifunction systems and digital copiers that target the 41-90 pages-per-minute segment of the market, which represents a substantial portion of the office business.
Xerox Fourth-Quarter 2004 Earnings Report / 4
 
The company reported fourth-quarter selling, administrative and general expenses of 25 percent of revenue, its lowest in the past decade. Fourth-quarter gross margins were 40 percent reflecting particularly strong performance in desktop office products and light production systems that impacted traditional product mix. The decline in gross profit from decreased revenue in Brazil also had an adverse impact on the company's overall gross margins.
 
Xerox generated operating cash flow of $816 million in the fourth quarter and ended the year with $1.8 billion in operating cash flow after contributing about $400 million to pension plans. The company's year-end cash balance was $3.2 billion, an increase of about $750 million from year-end 2003. Debt was down more than $1 billion year over year.
 
"We stayed well connected to our customers this past year, leveraging the power of Xerox people and solidifying our position as the global leader in document management, technology and services," said Mulcahy. "We're proud of our significant accomplishments and intend to build on this progress in 2005."
 
For the first quarter of 2005, Mulcahy said she expects earnings in the range of 17-20 cents per share.

Financial Review
 
Summary
 
 
from the 2003 fourth quarter including a 3-percentage point benefit from currency. Equipment sales grew 3 percent in the fourth quarter 2004 reflecting a 3-percentage point benefit from currency. The success of our color and digital light production products continued and was offset by mix to lower-end products in office monochrome segments. 2004 fourth quarter post sale and other revenue was essentially unchanged from the 2003 fourth quarter as declines in older light lens technology products and developing market operations ("DMO"), driven primarily by Brazil, were offset by digital office and production color growth as well as a 3-percentage point currency benefit. The Brazil and light lens declines reflect reductions in equipment at customer locations and related page volume declines. Finance income declined 6 percent, including a 3-percentage point benefit from currency.
Total fourth quarter 2004 revenues of $4.3 billion increased one percent
 
Fourth quarter 2004 net income included after-tax restructuring charges of $13 million ($24 million pre-tax). 2003 fourth quarter net income of $222 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, included after-tax restructuring charges of $76 million ($120 million pre-tax) and a $37 million after-tax ($61 million pre-tax) litigation provision reduction following court approval to settle the pension-related Berger v. Retirement Income Guarantee Plan (RIGP) litigation.
2004 fourth quarter net income was $240 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.
 
The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are enclosed as Appendix I.
 
Operations Review
 
Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:
 
 
of $1,429 million in the fourth quarter 2004 increased 3 percent from $1,381 million in the fourth quarter 2003 reflecting significant color and digital light production growth as well as a 3-percentage point benefit from currency, which were partially offset by mix in office monochrome products to the lower-end. Equipment sales results reflect the success of our technology investments and the resulting product launches as approximately two-thirds of the 2004 fourth quarter equipment sales were generated from products launched in the past 24 months and the Xerox iGen3. Color equipment sales continued to grow rapidly in the fourth quarter 2004 and represented about one-third of total equipment sales.
Equipment sales
 
2004 fourth quarter equipment sales grew 10 percent from the fourth quarter 2003 as favorable product mix and favorable currency more than offset modest install declines and low single-digit price declines. Color equipment sales growth reflects improved product mix, as the Xerox iGen3 and the newly launched DocuColor 8000 became a larger portion of the total units sold. Growth in Production monochrome equipment sales reflects strong Xerox 2101 and Xerox Nuvera 100 and 120 copier/printer install growth, which was only partially offset by a decline in high-end publishing and printing systems installs.
Production:
 
2004 fourth quarter equipment sales declined one percent from the 2003 fourth quarter as product mix and price declines of about 5 percent more than offset install growth and favorable currency. Product mix reflects an increased proportion of low-end equipment sales due to very strong growth in low-end monochrome multifunction devices ("Segments 1&2") and recently launched office printers.
Office:
 
Equipment sales in the fourth quarter 2004 declined $2 million from the 2003 fourth quarter, as declines in Brazil were only partially offset by growth in geographies where we successfully operate a two-tiered distribution model, such as Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. During the 2004 fourth quarter, we continued our transition to a two-tiered distribution model in Latin America to expand market coverage.
DMO:
 
of $2,665 million were essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter 2003 as a 3-percentage point benefit from currency offset declines from lower equipment populations. Post sale revenue is largely a function of the equipment at customer locations, the volume of pages produced by our customers on that equipment, the proportion of color pages, and associated services. Fourth quarter 2004 supplies, paper and other sales of $738 million (included within post sale and other revenue) grew 5 percent compared to the 2003 fourth quarter. Service, outsourcing and rental revenue of $1,927 million declined 2 percent from the 2003 fourth quarter as lower equipment populations and related page volumes more than offset currency benefits.
Post sale and other revenues
 
2004 fourth quarter post sale and other revenue declined 2 percent as monochrome declines, driven primarily by lower page volumes, more than offset very strong color page growth and favorable currency.
Production:
 
2004 fourth quarter post sale and other revenue grew one percent as favorable currency as well as digital monochrome and color page growth were only partially offset by page declines in older light lens technology.
Office:
 
2004 fourth quarter post sale and other revenue declined 6 percent, primarily reflecting Brazil's rental equipment population declines. In response, we have continued our transition to a two-tiered distribution model which is intended to increase, over time, sales of office devices and the associated supplies and service revenue.
DMO:
 
2004 fourth quarter post sale and other revenue increased 6 percent from the 2003 fourth quarter as the favorable impact of currency and growth in paper and other revenues more than offset declines in SOHO supply sales following our 2001 exit from this business.
Other:
 
Key Ratios and Expenses
 
 
Fourth quarter 2004 of 40.1 percent decreased 2.4 percentage points from the fourth quarter 2003. About 1.3 percentage points of the decline resulted from a greater proportion of lower gross margin products in office, production and other segments and approximately one percentage point of the decline resulted from the DMO segment. The declines in DMO related to Brazil's revenue which has declined faster than declines in its cost levels, and product mix to lower gross margin products in various DMO geographies. in the 2004 fourth quarter decreased 2.0 percentage points from the 2003 fourth quarter primarily related to mix in all segments. declined 2.6 percentage points from the fourth quarter 2003. About 0.7 percentage points of the decline is attributed to DMO where Brazil's revenue has declined faster than its cost levels. The balance of the decline primarily relates to mix.

expense of $191 million was $9 million less than the fourth quarter 2003. We continue to invest in technological development, particularly in color, and believe our R&D spending is at an adequate level to remain technologically competitive. Xerox R&D remains strategically coordinated with that of Fuji Xerox.
Research and development (R&D)
 
expenses of $1,081 million in the 2004 fourth quarter declined $31 million from the 2003 fourth quarter primarily due to general and administrative expense efficiencies, bad debt expense reductions and increased favorable business and use tax adjustments of $12 million which were only partially offset by an adverse currency impact of $33 million. The $12 million of favorable business and use tax adjustments resulted from a change in the estimated amounts payable to several domestic tax jurisdictions as well as favorable tax audit experience. Fourth quarter 2004 bad debt expense of $10 million was $31 million lower than the fourth quarter 2003 reflecting improvements in collections performance, receivables aging and write-off trends.
Selling, administrative and general (SAG)
 
In the fourth quarter 2004, we recorded of $24 million primarily consisting of new severance actions. The remaining restructuring reserve balance at December 31, 2004 for all restructuring programs was $117 million.
restructuring charges
 
Worldwide of 58,100 declined by 1,200 from the 2004 third quarter due to reductions attributable to our restructuring programs and attrition.
employment
 
for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:
Other expenses, net
 
 
Fourth quarter 2004 non-financing interest expense of $93 million declined $8 million from the fourth quarter of 2003. Lower debt balances and the December 2004 redemption of the trust preferred securities reduced expense by about $22 million. These declines were partially offset by interest rate increases and the absence of a $6 million benefit in the fourth quarter 2003 from the reversal of interest related to the Berger litigation.
 
Fourth quarter 2004 interest income decreased $9 million compared to the fourth quarter 2003 primarily due to the absence of $13 million of interest income related to Brazilian tax credits that became realizable in the fourth quarter 2003.
 
We recorded $27 million of currency losses in the fourth quarter 2004 compared to $19 million of currency losses in the fourth quarter 2003The increased 2004 losses primarily relate to the mark-to-market of derivatives that are economically hedging the cost of future foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in both Europe and the United States.
.
 
Gain on sales of businesses and assets of $10 million in the 2004 fourth quarter primarily reflects a $7 million favorable purchase price adjustment associated with a prior year sale of business.
 
Legal and regulatory matters in the 2004 fourth quarter reflect the adjustment of an estimate associated with a previously recorded litigation accrual, partially offset by expenses associated with the resolution of various legal matters, none of which was individually material. Legal and regulatory matters in the 2003 fourth quarter represent a $61 million litigation provision reduction following court approval to settle the pension-related Berger v. RIGP litigation.
 
In the fourth quarter 2004, we recorded income tax expense of $120 million compared with income tax expense of $123 million in the fourth quarter 2003. The effective tax rates for the fourth quarter 2004 and 2003 were 36.6 and 37.3 percent, respectively. The difference between the 2004 fourth quarter effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate relates primarily to the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions and to losses in certain jurisdictions where we are not providing tax benefits and continue to maintain deferred tax valuation allowances. Partially offsetting this impact is the favorable settlement of tax audits. The difference between the 2003 fourth quarter effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate relates primarily to the geographical mix of
 
income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions. Partially offsetting this impact are tax benefits arising from the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets following re-evaluation of their future realization due to improved financial performance in certain foreign jurisdictions.
 
Our effective tax rate will change based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2005 will approximate 38.0 percent.
 
primarily reflects our 25 percent share of Fuji Xerox's net income.
Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates
 
Segment Operating Profit
 
Total segment operating profit of $382 million in the fourth quarter 2004 declined $28 million from $410 million in the fourth quarter 2003. The 2004 fourth quarter total segment operating margin of 8.8 percent decreased 0.8 percentage points from the 2003 fourth quarter primarily reflecting reduced gross margins which were partially offset by decreased bad debt expense and increased equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates.
 
Production operating profit of $162 million and operating margin of 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter 2004 were essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter 2003. Modest declines in gross margins, due to product mix, and selling expense increases resulting from investments in sales resources, were offset by reductions in G&A expense, bad debt expense improvement and R&D efficiencies.
Production:
 
Office operating profit was $256 million in the fourth quarter 2004 compared to $240 million in the fourth quarter 2003. The 2004 fourth quarter Office operating margin of 12.3 percent increased 0.7 percentage points from the 2003 fourth quarter primarily reflecting decreased SAG expenses which were partially offset by modest gross margin declines due to product mix.
Office:
 
DMO operating profit was $7 million in the fourth quarter 2004 compared to $59 million in the fourth quarter 2003. The decline primarily reflects the impacts from Brazil where revenue has declined faster than cost and expense reductions as well as product mix in various geographies toward lower end products.
DMO:
 
Fourth quarter 2004 Other operating loss of $43 million improved $7 million from the fourth quarter 2003, primarily reflecting increased equity income from Fuji Xerox.

Cash Flow Analysis
 
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 as reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:
 
 
Fourth quarter 2004 of $816 million decreased $155 million from the 2003 fourth quarter. The decrease primarily results from $136 million generated by the early termination of certain interest rate swaps in 2003 that was not repeated in 2004, from $75 million in lower relative increases in accounts payable and accrued compensation due to timing, from $56 million of increased growth in finance receivables related to increased equipment sales, as well as other year-over-year changes. These decreases in cash were partially offset by $120 million from reduced inventories and a $113 million favorable decrease in accounts receivable and billed portion of finance receivables.
cash flows from operating activities
 
of $(80) million for the fourth quarter 2004 included capital expenditures and internal use software spending of $86 million, as well as the net cash spending of $12 million in connection with increasing our ownership interest in our Indian subsidiary. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds of $11 million from divestitures and the sale of real estate and $7 million released from restricted cash. The fourth quarter 2003 primarily consisted of $205 million released from restricted cash, partially offset by capital expenditures and internal use software spending of $90 million.
Cash flows from investing activities
 
of $(1,011) million for the fourth quarter 2004 primarily consisted of a net repayment of term and other debt of $1,042 million and dividends on our Series C preferred stock of $14 million, offset by net proceeds on secured borrowings of $27 million and proceeds from stock option exercises of $20 million. Cash flows from financing activities of $(974) million for the fourth quarter 2003 primarily consisted of scheduled payments on term and other debt of $1,194 million, dividends on our preferred stock of $25 million, offset by net proceeds on secured borrowings of $237 million.

Recent Events
 
Redemption of Trust Preferreds
 
In December, we exercised our right of redemption of our liability to the Xerox trust issuing Convertible Trust Preferred Securities. Holders of substantially all of the 20.7 million trust preferred securities converted $1.035 billion aggregate principal amount of securities into 113 million shares of our common stock. The issuance of the shares upon conversion had no impact on EPS since they were previously included in diluted EPS in accordance with "if converted" methodology.
