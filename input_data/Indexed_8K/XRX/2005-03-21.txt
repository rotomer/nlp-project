Item 8.01 Other Events
 
On March 18, 2005, Registrant closed the sale of Integic Corporation ("Integic") and will record a gain of approximately $93 million ($58 million after tax) in the first quarter of 2005.
 
In its Form 8-K Report dated February 17, 2005, Registrant disclosed that it tendered its entire equity interest in Integic, and that the gain from the sale is expected to be offset by charges associated with restructuring initiatives.
 
The restructuring initiatives are expected to include approximately $38 million in the first-quarter of 2005 for various initiatives, none of which Registrant believes to be material, individually or in the aggregate. Also included, as disclosed in Registrant's Form 8-K Report dated March 1, 2005, is an expected second-quarter 2005 restructuring charge of approximately $55 million related to a voluntary severance program primarily for U.S. technical services employees.
