Item 1.01. Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 19, 2005, Registrant's Board of Directors and Compensation Committee approved accelerating the vesting of approximately 733,000 unvested stock options previously granted in 2004 to Registrant's corporate officers. These options are outstanding under Registrant's 1991 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2004 Performance Incentive Plan. Previously, Registrant approved a similar action for approximately 2,883,000 unvested stock options granted in 2004 to its non-officer employees. The vesting of all these options is effective December 31, 2005. These accelerated options have a weighted average exercise price of $13.71, represent approximately 4 percent of Registrant's total outstanding options and would have been scheduled to vest on December 31, 2006 or January 1, 2007. As disclosed in Registrant's 2004 Annual Report, in lieu of stock options, Registrant began granting in 2005 time- and performance-based restricted stock awards, which are already reflected as compensation expense in its results of operations. Therefore, the acceleration of vesting for previously awarded stock options effectively completes the transition to the new stock-based award program.
 
The primary purpose of this accelerated vesting is to eliminate compensation expense Registrant would recognize in its results of operations upon the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," which is effective for Registrant beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Registrant expects the acceleration to reduce its pre-tax stock option compensation expense in 2006 by approximately $31 million or $0.02 per diluted share, of which $6 million is related to the May 19, 2005 action taken by Registrant's Board of Directors and Compensation Committee.
