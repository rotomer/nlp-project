EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STAMFORD, Conn., July 25, 2005  Xerox Corporation (NYSE: XRX) announced today second-quarter earnings per share of 40 cents, including a 33 cent per share gain from a recent IRS tax settlement, which was partially offset by restructuring charges of 13 cents per share.
 
Equipment sales in the second quarter increased 4 percent year over year, and total revenue of $3.9 billion increased 2 percent. Both equipment sales and total revenue included a currency benefit of 2 percentage points. The overall post-sale trend improved as the revenue stream from new digital systems and services offset declines from the company's older light-lens technology.
 
"Xerox's investment in innovation strengthened top-line results in the second quarter with our industry-leading color technology driving equipment sale growth," said Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer.
 
Gross margin of 39 percent was lower than expected due to a change in the company's traditional product mix, which impacted net income in the quarter. The shift in product mix is primarily due to increased sales activity for desktop office products as well as light production and color systems.

"These equipment sales will drive future post-sale gains, and, at the same time, we're adjusting our business model to respond to the resulting pressure on margins," added Mulcahy. "We remain confident that these actions and increased sales of new technology  25 new products launched in the second quarter  coupled with growth from Xerox Global Services provide the marketplace momentum for strong second-half performance."
 
Revenue from color products grew 17 percent in the second quarter. Color is a key driver of Xerox's growth strategy as the increasing volume of pages printed on the company's color systems flows through to post-sale revenue. Only 3 percent of the total pages produced in businesses today are printed on color devices. Xerox expects new color services and technologies to drive that number to 10 percent of pages by 2008, fueling a $22 billion market opportunity.
 
Xerox's production business provides commercial printers and document-intensive industries with high-speed digital technology that enables on-demand, personalized printing. Total production revenue was flat year over year. Production equipment sale growth of 3 percent only partially offset a decline in production post-sale and financing revenue. Second-quarter install activity for production monochrome systems increased 1 percent primarily due to the success of the Xerox 4110 light production system, which offset declines in activity for high-end production monochrome systems. Production color installs grew 18 percent largely due to strong placements of the Xerox iGen3 Digital Production Press and the DocuColor 8000 Digital Press. In May, Xerox announced the DocuColor 7000 Digital Press, further solidifying the company's production portfolio as the broadest in the industry.
 
In Xerox's office business, which provides technology and services for workgroups of any size, equipment sales were up 7 percent and total revenue grew 2 percent. Activity was exceptionally strong in the second quarter with office color multifunction systems up 69 percent and office color printing activity up 155 percent. Office monochrome activity was up 26 percent driven by increased demand for Xerox WorkCentre desktop multifunction systems.

In late June, Xerox announced 24 office products, software and services that target a $60 billion market. With the addition of these products, 95 percent of Xerox's office product line has been completely refreshed over the past 24 months. It remains the industry's most comprehensive, serving every segment of the business market.
 
The company reported second-quarter selling, administrative and general expenses of 26.7 percent of revenue, a modest improvement from the second quarter of last year.
 
In the second quarter, Xerox generated operating cash flow of $290 million after contributing $230 million to its primary U.S. pension plan. The company closed the quarter with a cash and short-term investments balance of $2.1 billion. Debt was down $2.1 billion year over year and down $1.5 billion from the first quarter of this year.
 
For the third quarter of 2005, Mulcahy said she expects earnings in the range of 16-18 cents per share, which includes anticipated additional restructuring charges of 1 cent per share.

Financial Review
 
 
Summary
 
grew 2 percent from the 2004 second quarter including a 2-percentage point benefit from currency. Equipment sales in the second quarter 2005 grew 4 percent from the 2004 second quarter, also including a 2-percentage point benefit from currency. Equipment sales growth reflects strong sales of lower-end office black and white devices, color printers, as well as office and production color systems, which more than offset declines in other monochrome office and production products. Second quarter 2005 post sale and other revenue grew 2 percent from the 2004 second quarter including a 2-percentage point currency benefit. Increased post sale revenues from digital office and production products offset the declines from older technology light lens products. Finance income declined 6 percent, including a 2-percentage point benefit from currency.
Total second quarter 2005 revenues of $3.9 billion
 
included a $343 million after-tax benefit related to finalization of the 1996-1998 IRS audit, as well as after-tax restructuring charges of $130 million ($194 million pre-tax). 2004 second quarter net income of $208 million or $0.21 per diluted share included an after-tax gain of $30 million ($38 million pre-tax) from the sale of our ownership interest in ScanSoft, Inc. and after-tax restructuring charges of $21 million ($33 million pre-tax).
Second quarter 2005 net income of $423 million or $0.40 per diluted share
 
The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are enclosed as Appendix I.
 
The comparison of the actual benefit from the IRS tax settlement and the restructuring charges as compared to their approximate amounts as was previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 30, 2005 is set forth on Appendix IV.
Operations Review
 
Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:
 
 
of $1,109 million in the second quarter 2005 increased 4 percent, from the 2004 second quarter reflecting strong sales of lower-end office black and white devices, color printers and office and production color systems, as well as a 2-percentage point benefit from currency. These increases were partially offset by mix in office monochrome to lower-end products and in production monochrome to light production systems. Equipment sales reflect the results of our technology investments and the associated product launches as approximately two-thirds of the second quarter 2005 equipment sales were generated from products launched in the past 24 months. Color equipment sales grew 22 percent in the second quarter 2005 and represented 37 percent of total equipment sales compared to 18 percent growth and 32 percent of total revenue in the 2004 second quarter.
Equipment sales
 
Second quarter 2005 equipment sales grew approximately 3 percent from the 2004 second quarter reflecting an 18 percent install growth in production color products, 1 percent install growth in monochrome production products, and favorable currency. Color equipment sales growth reflected strong installs of the Xerox iGen3 Digital Production Press, and the Xerox DocuColor 8000. Monochrome equipment sales revenue declined because of a higher proportion of sales in light production and mid-production systems as compared to more higher-end systems sales in 2004.
Production:
 
Second quarter 2005 equipment sales increased 7 percent from the 2004 second quarter driven by strong install activity including 29 percent growth in black and white digital copiers and multifunction devices, 69 percent growth in office color copiers and multifunction devices and 155 percent growth in color printers, as well as favorable currency. Strong activity growth was partially offset by product mix, which reflected an increased proportion of lower-end equipment sales.
Office:
 
DMO equipment sales consist primarily of Segment 1&2 devices and printers. Equipment sales in the second quarter 2005 increased by $12 million, or 10 percent, from the 2004 second quarter reflecting strong growth in Russia and other Eastern European geographies.
DMO:
of $2,592 million increased 2 percent from the 2004 second quarter, including a 2-percentage point benefit from currency, as growth in digital products and DMO offset declines in light lens products. Post sale revenue is largely a function of the equipment placed at customer locations, the volume of prints and copies that our customers make on that equipment, the mix of color pages, as well as associated services. Post sale color revenue of $657 million grew 15 percent in the second quarter 2005, and represented 25 percent of total post sale and other revenues. Second quarter 2005 supplies, paper and other sales of $718 million (included within post sale and other revenue) and service, outsourcing and rental revenue of $1,874 million grew 4 percent and 1 percent, respectively, from the 2004 second quarter primarily reflecting the impact of favorable currency.
Post sale and other revenues
 
Second quarter 2005 post sale and other revenue was comparable to the 2004 second quarter as strong growth in color pages and favorable currency offset declines in monochrome pages.
Production:
 
Second quarter 2005 post sale and other revenue grew 1 percent from the 2004 second quarter as growth in digital monochrome and color printing and multifunction products, as well as favorable currency, more than offset declines in older light lens technology.
Office:
 
Second quarter 2005 post sale and other revenue grew 4 percent from the 2004 second quarter primarily reflecting supplies growth in Eurasia and Eastern European geographies.
DMO:
 
Second quarter 2005 post sale and other revenue grew $16 million, or 4 percent from the 2004 second quarter as increased paper sales and other revenues more than offset declines in SOHO sales.
Other:
 
 
Key Ratios and Expenses
 
Second quarter 2005 of 39.0 percent declined 2.3-percentage points from the 2004 second quarter primarily reflecting product mix, as cost improvements and other variances offset the impact of price declines. Second quarter 2005 of 33.2 percent declined 3.0-percentage points from the 2004 second quarter driven by product mix, reflecting a higher proportion of sales of products with lower gross margins. Cost improvements and other variances more than offset the impact of price declines.
total gross margin
sales gross margin
decreased 1.4-percentage points from the 2004 second quarter due to mix and special compensation payments related to the 2005 annual merit increase process. Cost improvements more than offset the impact of price declines.
Service, outsourcing and rentals margin
 
expense of $188 million was $1 million higher than the 2004 second quarter as increased spending in the Office segment was primarily offset by lower expenditures in the Production segment reflecting recent product launches as well as the efficiencies we capture from our platform development strategy. We invest in technological development, particularly in color, and believe our R&D spending is sufficient to remain technologically competitive. Xerox R&D remains strategically coordinated with Fuji Xerox.
Research and development (R&D)
 
In addition to R&D, we incur sustaining engineering costs related to our products. These costs are incurred with respect to ongoing product improvements after initial product launch. Effective July 1, 2005, we will reclassify these costs from cost of sales to a new line item in our income statement entitled Research, Development and Engineering (R,D&E). This presentation aligns our external reporting presentation to our internal management of these costs. See Appendix III for impact of this change on current and prior periods.
 
expenses of $1,046 million in the second quarter 2005 decreased by $4 million from the 2004 second quarter. A $14 million increase in selling expense, which included special compensation payments related to the 2005 annual merit increase process, and adverse currency of $24 million were more than offset by $22 million in general and administrative ("G&A") expense reductions and a $20 million reduction in bad debt expense. Second quarter 2005 bad debt expense of $15 million reflected improvements in collection performance, receivables aging and write-off trends.
Selling, administrative and general (SAG)
 
In the second quarter 2005, we recorded of $194 million, primarily related to headcount reductions of approximately 1,800 employees across all geographies and segments. The restructuring initiatives are focused on cost efficiencies in service, manufacturing, and back office support operations. The remaining restructuring reserve balance as of June 30, 2005, for all programs was $322 million, of which approximately $200 million is expected to be spent in 2005.
restructuring charges
 
Worldwide of 57,300 declined by approximately 700 from the first quarter 2005.
employment
 
for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:
Other (income) expenses, net
 
Second quarter 2005 non-financing interest expense of $62 million was $22 million lower than the 2004 second quarter. The decline relates to the conversion of the Xerox Capital Trust II liability in December 2004, and to lower average debt balances which were partially offset by higher interest rates.
 
Second quarter 2005 interest income increased by $59 million compared to the 2004 second quarter, reflecting interest income of $57 million associated with the previously disclosed settlement of the 1996-1998 IRS audit, and higher interest income of $17 million on invested cash due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates. These increases were partially offset by the absence of interest income of $21 million in 2004 related to a domestic tax refund.
 
The 2004 second quarter gain on sale of businesses and assets primarily reflects the $38 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our ownership interest in ScanSoft.
 
We recorded $6 million of currency gains in the second quarter 2005 compared to $18 million of currency losses in the 2004 second quarter. The second quarter 2005 gains are primarily related to the mark to market of derivative contracts that are economically hedging the cost of future foreign currency denominated inventory purchases and other future payments in Europe, which resulted from the weakening Euro. These gains were partially offset by the mark to market on derivative contracts economically hedging the cost of future foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in the United States, which resulted from the strengthening U.S. Dollar against the Japanese Yen.
 
In the second quarter 2005, we recorded of $233 million compared with income tax expense of $91 million in the second quarter 2004. The effective tax rates for the second quarter 2005 and 2004 were (199.1) percent and 33.5 percent, respectively. The difference between the 2005 second quarter consolidated effective tax rate of (199.1) percent and the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent is primarily due to tax benefits of $253 million, associated with the finalization of the 1996  1998 IRS audit, and a $33 million tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards. This reversal follows a re-evaluation of their future realization resulting from a refinancing of a foreign operation. These benefits and the tax impact of restructuring contributed to (237.3) percent of the (199.1) percent in the second quarter 2005. As previously disclosed, the finalization of the 1996  1998 IRS audit yielded benefits associated with a change in tax law that allowed us to recognize a tax benefit for capital losses associated with the disposition of our insurance group operations, as well as favorable resolution of other tax matters from the 1996  1998 IRS audit. The difference between the 2004 second quarter effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate relates primarily to a net $10 million domestic tax refund claim resulting from a change in tax law and to a $6 million tax benefit due to the book/tax basis difference on the sale of ScanSoft. These benefits were partially offset by losses in certain jurisdictions where we are not providing tax benefits and continue to maintain deferred tax valuation allowances. Our effective tax rate will change based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for the second half of the year will approximate 38 percent.
income tax
benefits
of $20 million in the second quarter 2005 decreased $7 million from the 2004 second quarter reflecting a $4 million decrease in our 25 percent share of Fuji Xerox's net income and the absence of $3 million of equity income from Integic Corporation. In first quarter 2005, we sold our entire equity interest in Integic Corporation.
Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates
 
in the second quarter 2005 of $53 million represents the after-tax benefit resulting from the completion of the 1996 - 1998 IRS audit. This benefit reflects the favorable resolution of certain tax matters associated with our discontinued operations.
Income from discontinued operations
 
Segment Operating Profit
 
Total segment operating profit was $337 million in the second quarter 2005 compared to $332 million in the 2004 second quarter. The second quarter 2005 total segment operating margin of 8.6 percent was unchanged from the 2004 second quarter.
 
Production operating profit was $79 million in the second quarter 2005 compared to $122 million in the 2004 second quarter. The second quarter 2005 Production operating margin of 7.0 percent declined 3.9-percentage points from the 2004 second quarter primarily resulting from reduced gross margins, impacted by product mix. R&D as a percent of revenue decreased year over year as we captured the benefits from our platform strategy to launch new technology. SAG expenses increased slightly as selling expense increases were only partially offset by improvements in G&A and bad debts.
Production:
 
Office operating profit was $173 million in the second quarter 2005 compared to $187 million in the 2004 second quarter. The second quarter 2005 Office operating margin of 9.0 percent declined 1.0-percentage points from the 2004 second quarter primarily as a result of lower gross margin and higher R&D, which were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses, and improvements in bad debts.
Office:
 
: DMO operating profit was $19 million in the second quarter 2005 compared to $6 million in the 2004 second quarter. The second quarter 2005 DMO operating margin of 4.3 percent increased 2.9-percentage points from the 2004 second quarter. This reflects higher gross profit and lower G&A and bad debt expenses.
DMO
 
Second quarter 2005 Other operating profit of $66 million improved $49 million from the 2004 second quarter primarily reflecting higher interest income of $59 million, lower non-financing interest expense of $22 million and the absence of a $38 million gain from the 2004 second quarter sale of Xerox's ownership interest in ScanSoft, Inc.

Cash Flow Analysis
 
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 as reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:
 
 
In the second quarter 2005 we generated $290 million in as compared to $256 million for the same period in 2004. The $34 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily a result of the following changes:
cash flows from operating activities
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for the second quarter 2005 was a $237 million use of cash compared to a $225 million source of cash in the 2004 second quarter. The $462 million decrease in net cash provided by investing activities primarily relates to the following:
Cash flows from investing activities
 
 
 
for the second quarter 2005 totaled $1,410 million, including a payment of $924 million related to an unsecured debt obligation. The increase of $1,186 million in cash usage compared to the 2004 second quarter is primarily due to the following:
Cash flows used in financing activities
 
 
 
 
Financing Activity
 
During the second quarter 2005, we originated loans, secured by finance receivables, generating cash proceeds of $38 million and repaid loans, secured by finance receivables, of $484 million. As of June 30, 2005, 54 percent of total finance receivables were encumbered as compared to 59 percent at December 31, 2004. Consistent with our objective to rebalance the level of secured and unsecured debt, we expect payments on secured loans will continue to exceed proceeds from new secured loans in 2005. Further, we intend to reduce our overall debt and the proportion of secured debt in our capital structure.
 
The following table compares finance receivables to financing related debt as of June 30, 2005:
 
Debt
 
Our debt maturities for the remainder of 2005 and 2006 by quarter, and 2007, 2008, 2009 by year and thereafter are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Following is a summary of the changes discussed in the Segment Revenue and Profit table of this document. The tables below illustrate the impact of these changes on segment quarterly operating profit for 2004 (in millions):

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In an effort to provide investors with additional and useful information regarding the Company's results of operations, the Company has disclosed in this press release certain financial measures that are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in the SEC rules. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information to the investors in analyzing the effect of the actual benefit from the IRS tax settlement and the restructuring charges, the approximate amounts of which were previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 30, 2005. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles follows:
