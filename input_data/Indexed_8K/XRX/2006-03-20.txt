If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantor and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover.
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand, or by the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts or commissions received by it hereunder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter otherwise would have been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and the officers, directors and affiliates of each Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriters; and each officer and director of the Company, the Guarantor and each person, if any, who controls the Company and the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective amount of Notes they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
SECTION 9. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company and the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of the Notes to the Underwriters.

Termination; General
(b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 5 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 7, 8 and 9 hereof shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

(b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date pursuant to this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section 11 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangement.

The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of any Guarantee set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the Guarantor.
SECTION 1403.
Limitation of Guarantee.
The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount as shall, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under the Indenture, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor in a amount based on the net assets of each Guarantor, determined in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 5(d)
March 20, 2006
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Xerox Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering and sale by the Company of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.40% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes") to be issued under a third supplemental indenture, dated as of March 20, 2006 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") to an indenture, dated as of June 25, 2003 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee and as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, dated as of June 25, 2003, among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), and by a second supplemental indenture, dated as of August 10, 2004, among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Third Supplemental Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"). The Indenture provides that the Notes are to be guaranteed (the "Guarantee") by Xerox International Joint Marketing, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Indenture.
In that connection, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion, including the Indenture and the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration Nos. 333-111623, 333-111623-01 and 333-111623-02) (the "Registration Statement") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") relating to the registration under the
Securities Act of various securities of the Company and guarantees of certain securities of the Company. As to various questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon representations of officers or directors of the Company and documents furnished to us by the Company without independent verification of their accuracy. We have also assumed (a) the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies and (b) that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represents a legal, valid and binding obligation of, the Trustee.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes issued by the Company and the Guarantee issued by the Guarantor have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, and, when the Notes are authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered, the Notes and the Guarantee will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantor, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with their respective terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. We also consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission.
We are admitted to practice in the State of New York and we do not express any opinion with respect to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States of America.
