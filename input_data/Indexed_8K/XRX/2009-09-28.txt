Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors of all parties, ACS will be merged with and into Merger Sub.
As a result of the merger, each outstanding share of ACS's Class A common stock, other than shares owned by Xerox, Merger Sub, or ACS (which will be cancelled) and other than those shares with respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn (collectively, "Excluded Shares"), will be converted into the right to receive a combination of (i) 4.935 shares of common stock of Xerox ("Common Stock") and (ii) $18.60 in cash, without interest. As a result of the merger, each outstanding share of Class B common stock of ACS, other than Excluded Shares, will be converted into the right to receive (i) 4.935 shares of Common Stock, (ii) $18.60 in cash, without interest and (iii) a fraction of a share of a new series of convertible preferred stock to be issued by Xerox and designated as Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock ("Convertible Preferred Stock") equal to (x) 300,000 divided by (y) the number of shares of Class B common stock of ACS issued and outstanding as of the effective time of the merger. A description of the Convertible Preferred Stock is set forth in Item 5.03 below.
The consummation of the merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others: (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by ACS's stockholders, (ii) the approval of the issuance of Common Stock by Xerox's stockholders, (iii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the receipt of other material antitrust approvals and (iv) the lenders providing Xerox with debt financing in connection with the Merger shall not have declined to provide such financing at closing primarily due to the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect (both as defined in the Merger Agreement) or due to Xerox failing to receive (A) from Standard & Poor's, within one week of the date of closing, a reaffirmation of the corporate credit rating of Xerox after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, which shall be BBB- or higher (stable) at closing and (B) from Moody's, within one week of the date of closing, a reaffirmation of the corporate family rating of Xerox after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, which shall be Baa3 or higher (stable) at closing. In addition, the credit ratings (after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including, any issuance of Notes (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter (as defined below)), of each issue of notes outstanding at closing (not including the outstanding 8% trust preferred securities) of Xerox or any of its subsidiaries shall be at least BBB- (stable) from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 (stable) from Moody's at closing.
The Merger Agreement contains customary covenants, including covenants providing for each of the parties: (i) to use reasonable best efforts to cause the transaction to be consummated, (ii) not to solicit alternate transactions, and (iii) to call and hold a special stockholders' meeting and recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement, in the case of ACS, and issuance of Common Stock, in the case of Xerox.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that (i) upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including a change in the recommendation of the board of ACS, ACS will owe Xerox a cash termination fee of $194 million, (ii) upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including a change in the recommendation of the board of Xerox, Xerox will owe ACS a cash termination fee of $235 million and (iii) upon the termination of the Merger Agreement due to Xerox's failure to obtain the required stockholder approval at the Xerox stockholders' meeting, Xerox will owe ACS a cash termination fee of $65 million.
Xerox is also obligated to pay a cash termination fee of $323 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated because the merger is not consummated by June 27, 2010 and on such date, all closing conditions except the financing condition are satisfied.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is included to provide you with information regarding its terms. It does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
Voting Agreement
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Darwin Deason (the "Stockholder"), owner of 43.6% of the outstanding voting power of ACS as of September 28, 2009, entered into a Voting Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2009 (the "Voting Agreement"), with Xerox, pursuant to which, among other things, the Stockholder agreed to vote his shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and against any takeover bid by a third party. The Stockholder's agreement to vote his shares of ACS common stock as described above is subject to limitations if the ACS board of directors changes its recommendation with respect to the merger, in which case the Stockholder is required to vote in favor of the merger only a number of shares equal to 21.8% of the outstanding voting power of ACS, with the remaining shares, subject to the following sentence, being required to be voted proportionate to the manner in which all other shares of ACS common stock not beneficially owned by the Stockholder are voted at the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement. If the ACS board of directors changes its recommendation with respect to the merger in connection with a financially superior takeover proposal, the Stockholder is entitled to vote the remaining shares in his sole discretion.
The Stockholder has granted an irrevocable proxy in favor of designated officers of Xerox to vote its shares of ACS common stock as required.
The Voting Agreement prohibits the Stockholder from taking various actions that could reasonably be expected to facilitate a competing takeover proposal for ACS, except that if the ACS board has determined that a competing takeover proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a financially superior takeover proposal (i) the Stockholder is entitled to participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such takeover proposal and (ii) if the ACS board changes its recommendation of the merger in connection with such financially superior takeover proposal, the Stockholder is entitled to enter into a voting agreement or proxy with respect to the remaining shares.
The Voting Agreement will terminate on the earliest of (a) the effective time of the merger, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement and (c) the making of any waiver, amendment or modification of the Merger Agreement or the Certificate of Amendment that (i) reduces the value or changes the type of consideration payable to holders of ACS common stock in the merger or (ii) is otherwise adverse to holders of ACS common stock.
The foregoing description of the Voting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
Debt Commitment Letter
Concurrently, and in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Xerox entered into a debt commitment letter (the "Debt Commitment Letter") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. pursuant to which, subject to the conditions set forth therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. committed to provide to Xerox unsecured bridge financing of up to $3.0 billion (the "Bridge Facility"), the proceeds of which will be used (i) first, to repay or redeem ACS's indebtedness outstanding on the date of consummation of the merger (the "Closing Date") other than its 5.20% senior notes due 2015, 4.70% senior notes due 2010 and capitalized lease obligations and (ii) second, to fund, in part the cash consideration for the merger and pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the merger. The Bridge Facility will mature on the first anniversary of the Closing Date; however, subject to certain conditions, Xerox may elect to (a) extend the maturity date for up to $1.5 billion of the aggregate principal amount of the Bridge Facility to the second anniversary of the Closing Date and (b) further extend the maturity date for up to $750 million of the aggregate principal amount of the Bridge Facility to the third anniversary of the Closing Date.
The foregoing description of the Debt Commitment Letter is included to provide you with information regarding its terms. It does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Debt Commitment Letter, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Issuance of Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Xerox agreed to issue 300,000 shares of Xerox's Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock") to the holders of Class B common stock of ACS.
Cash dividends will be payable quarterly on the Series A Preferred Stock when, as and if declared by the board of directors, out of any funds legally available for the payment of dividends, on a cumulative basis, at a rate per year equal to 8.0% of the liquidation preference. If Xerox does not pay dividends in full on any dividend payment date, cash dividends will be payable, on a cumulative basis, at a rate per year equal to 8.0% of the sum of the liquidation preference and the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends as of the most recent dividend payment date. In addition, if Xerox does not pay dividends in full on any dividend payment date, the ability of Xerox to declare, pay dividends on, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, will be subject to certain restrictions.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 89.8876 shares of common stock (which reflects an initial conversion price of approximately $11.125 per share of common stock, which is a 25% premium over $8.90, which was the average closing price of Xerox's common stock over the 7-trading day period ended on September 14, 2009), subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, the holder will have the right to convert, under certain circumstances, each share of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common stock at an increased conversion rate. On or after the fifth anniversary of the issue date, Xerox will have the right, at its option, to cause, under certain circumstances, any or all of the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of common stock at the then applicable conversion rate.
Upon the occurrence of certain fundamental change events, the holder of Series A Preferred Stock has the right to require Xerox to redeem any or all of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a redemption price per share equal to the liquidation preference and any accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including the redemption date. At any time on or following the fifth anniversary of a transfer by the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock to a person other than a permitted transferee, Xerox has the option to redeem any or all of such transferred shares of Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a redemption price per share equal to the fair market value of such redeemed shares and any accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including the redemption date.
The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are more fully described in the Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of Xerox (the "Certificate of Amendment") establishing the rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations relating to the Series A Preferred Stock. A form of the Certificate of Amendment is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

If a Dividend Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the dividends will be paid on the next Business Day as if it were paid on the Dividend Payment Date and no interest will accrue in connection therewith.
Dividend Payment Date
(iii) The amount of dividends payable for each full quarterly Dividend Period will be computed by dividing the Dividend Rate by four. The amount of dividends payable for the initial Dividend Period, or any other Dividend Period shorter or longer than a full quarterly Dividend Period, will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such Dividend Period over a 360-day year.

Securities, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Junior Securities, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to (x) the Liquidation Preference and (y) an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A Preferred Stock through the date of such liquidating distribution. After payment of the full amount of such liquidating distribution, the Holder(s) will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by, and shall have no right or claim to any remaining assets, of the Corporation.
(ii) In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on any Parity Securities, the Holder(s) and the holders of such Parity Securities shall share ratably in any distribution of assets of the Corporation in proportion to the full respective liquidating distributions which would be payable on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.
(iii) Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other entity, nor the consolidation or merger of any other entity with or into the Corporation, nor the sale, lease or other transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property or business or other assets shall, in and of itself, constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

(i) On or after the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date, the Corporation shall have the right, at its option, at any time or from time to time to cause some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then Applicable Conversion Rate, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid
 
dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted through the Mandatory Conversion Date, if, for 20 Trading Days during any period of 30 consecutive Trading Days (including the last Trading Day of such period), ending on the Trading Day preceding the date the Corporation delivers a Notice of Mandatory Conversion, the Closing Price of the Common Stock exceeds 130% of the then Applicable Conversion Price.
(ii) If the Corporation elects to cause fewer than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted pursuant to this Subdivision 13(h), the Corporation shall select the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted on a pro rata basis or by another method the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, considers fair to the Holders. If the Corporation selects a portion of a Holder's Series A Preferred Stock for partial mandatory conversion and such Holder converts a portion of its shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for mandatory conversion under this Subdivision 13(h).
(iii) If the Corporation elects to exercise the mandatory conversion right pursuant to this Subdivision 13(h), the Corporation shall provide notice of such conversion to each Holder (such notice, a ""). The conversion date shall be a date selected by the Corporation (the "") and shall be no more than 7 days after the date on which the Corporation provides such Notice of Mandatory Conversion. In addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, the Notice of Mandatory Conversion shall state, as appropriate:

and the Holder(s) shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock (and/or other securities, if applicable) issuable upon conversion (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock (and/or other securities, if applicable) issuable upon conversion and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock (and/or other securities, if applicable) issuable upon conversion) by virtue of holding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
(iii) The Person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock (and/or cash, securities or other property, if applicable) issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock (and/or other securities, if applicable) as of the Close of Business on the Mandatory Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date. In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock (and/or cash, securities or other property, if applicable) and payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to be issued or paid upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock should be registered or paid or the manner in which such shares should be delivered, the Corporation shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares, and make such payments, in the name of the Holder and in the manner shown on the records of the Corporation.
(iv) Shares of Series A Preferred Stock duly converted in accordance with this Certificate of Incorporation, or otherwise reacquired by the Corporation, will resume the status of authorized and unissued Cumulative Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance. The Corporation may from time-to-time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock; that no decrease shall reduce the authorized number of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding.
provided
(v) Conversion into shares of Common Stock will occur on the Mandatory Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date as follows:
(A) On the Mandatory Conversion Date, certificates representing shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered to the Holder(s) or their designee upon presentation and surrender of the certificate evidencing the Series A Preferred Stock to the Corporation and, if required, the furnishing of appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the payment of all transfer and similar taxes.
(B) On the date of any conversion at the option of the Holder(s) pursuant to Subdivision 13(g), a Holder must do each of the following in order to convert:
 
(1) surrender the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the Corporation;

(C) If more than one share of the Series A Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock so surrendered.
.
(j) Anti-Dilution Adjustments
(i) The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Corporation in accordance with this Subdivision 13(j).
(ii) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, pay a dividend or make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its Common Stock to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Subdivision 13(j)(ii) shall become effective immediately after the Record Date for such dividend or distribution. If any dividend or distribution that is the subject of this Subdivision 13(j)(ii) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay or make such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Subdivision 13(j)(ii), the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding at the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution shall not include shares of Common Stock held in treasury, if any.
(iii) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, (x) subdivide the then Common Stock Outstanding into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or (y) combine the then Common Stock Outstanding into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Subdivision 13(j)(iii) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination.
(iv) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, distribute to holders of all or substantially all of the Common Stock any rights or warrants (other than a distribution of rights issued pursuant to a stockholder's rights plan, to the extent such rights are attached to shares of Common Stock (in which event the provisions of Subdivision 13(j)(xv) shall apply), a dividend reinvestment plan or an issuance in connection with a transaction in which Subdivision 13(k) applies) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase, for a period of not more than 60 calendar days from the issuance date of such distribution, shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Subdivision 13(j)(iv) shall become effective immediately after the Record Date for such distribution. If such rights or warrants described in this Subdivision 13(j)(iv) are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to distribute such rights or warrants, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared. To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the distribution of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Corporation upon exercise of such rights and warrants and the value of such consideration (if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Subdivision 13(j)(iv), the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding at the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution shall not include shares of Common Stock held in treasury, if any.
(v) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, by dividend or
 
otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock of the Corporation, evidences of its indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire the Corporation's capital stock or other securities, but excluding:
(A) any dividends or distributions referred to in Subdivision 13(j)(ii);
(B) any rights or warrants referred to in Subdivision 13(j)(iv);
(C) any dividends or distributions referred to in Subdivision 13(j)(vi);
(D) any dividends and distributions in connection with a transaction to which Subdivision 13(k) shall apply; and
(E) any Spin-Offs to which the provision set forth below in this Subdivision 13(j)(v) shall apply,
(any such shares of capital stock, indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire Common Stock or other securities, hereinafter in this Subdivision 13(j)(v) called the ""), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
where,
 
 
If the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Subdivision 13(j)(v) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation (a "") that are, or when issued will be, traded or listed on the New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global Select Market, The NASDAQ Global Market or any other U.S. national securities exchange or association, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
where,
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Subdivision 13(j)(v) shall become effective immediately after the Record Date for such distribution. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Subdivision 13(j)(v) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date
 
the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required under this Subdivision 13(j)(v), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock that may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required under this Subdivision 13(j)(v) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Subdivision 13(j)(v).
(vi) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, by dividend or otherwise make a distribution to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock consisting exclusively of cash, but excluding:
(A) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (whether voluntary or involuntary), or upon a transaction to which Subdivision 13(k) applies, or
(B) regular cash dividends to the extent that such dividends do not exceed $0.25 per share in any Fiscal Quarter (the ""),
Dividend Threshold Amount
then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
 
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Subdivision 13(j)(vi) shall become effective immediately after the Record Date for such dividend or distribution. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Subdivision 13(j)(vi) is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(vii) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, make a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock subject to the tender offer rules, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer (the ""), then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
where,
 
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Subdivision 13(j)(vii) shall become effective immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date. If the Corporation, or one of its subsidiaries, is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Corporation or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this Subdivision 13(j)(vii) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Subdivision 13(j)(vii). If an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required under this Subdivision 13(j)(vii), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Subdivision 13(j)(vii).
 
(viii) In cases where the Fair Market Value of shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets (including cash), or securities or certain rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Corporation, or the amount of the cash dividend or distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock, distributed to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock:
(A) equals or exceeds the Current Market Price of the Common Stock; or
(B) the Current Market Price of the Common Stock exceeds the Fair Market Value of such assets, debt securities or rights, warrants or options or the amount of cash so distributed by less than $1.00,
rather than being entitled to an adjustment in the Conversion Rate, the Holder(s) will be entitled to receive upon conversion, in addition to shares of Common Stock, the kind and amount of shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, or securities or rights, warrants or options comprising the distribution, if any, that such Holder(s) would have received if such Holder(s) had held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the principal amount of the notes held divided by the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the distribution.
(ix) All calculations under this Subdivision 13(j) shall be made to the nearest 1/100,000 of a share of Common Stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock. No adjustment in the Conversion Rate is required if the amount of such adjustment would be less than 1%; , , that any such adjustment not required to be made pursuant to this Subdivision 13(j)(ix) will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.
provided
however
(x) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made if the Holder(s) may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment, as a result of holding the Series A Preferred Stock, without having to convert the Series A Preferred Stock, as if they held the full number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of the Series A Preferred Stock may then be converted.
(xi) The Corporation may, but is not required to, make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Subdivision 13(j)(ii) through (vii), as the Board of Directors deems advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of Common Stock (or rights to acquire Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
 
(xii) In addition to the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Corporation from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 Business Days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall mail to Holder(s) a notice of the increase, which notice will be given at least 15 calendar days prior to the effectiveness of any such increase, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
(xiii) If during a period applicable for calculating the Closing Price of Common Stock or any other security, an event occurs that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate, the Closing Price of such security shall be calculated for such period in a manner reasonably determined by the Corporation to appropriately reflect the impact of such event on the price of such security during such period. Whenever any provision of this Subdivision 13 requires a calculation of an average of Closing Prices of Common Stock or any other security over multiple days, appropriate adjustments shall be made to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Record Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period during which the average is to be calculated.
(xiv) Whenever the Conversion Rate is to be adjusted in accordance with Subdivision 13(j), the Corporation shall compute the Conversion Rate in accordance with Subdivision 13(j), taking into account Subdivision 13(j)(ix), and provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holder(s) of the occurrence of such event and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate.
(xv) Rights Plans. If the Corporation has a rights plan in effect with respect to the Common Stock on the Mandatory Conversion Date or any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Holder of such shares will receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan relating to such Common Stock, unless, prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date or such Conversion Date, the rights have (x) become exercisable or (y) separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of such rights plan (the first of events to occur being the ""), in either of which cases the Conversion Rate will be adjusted, effective automatically at the time of such Trigger Event, as if the Corporation had made a distribution of such rights to all holders of the Common Stock as described in Subdivision 13(j)(iv) (without giving effect to the 60 day limit on the exercisability of rights and
Trigger Event
 
warrants ordinarily subject to such Subdivision 13(j)(iv)), subject to appropriate readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights prior to the exercise, deemed exercise or exchange thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such stockholder rights are exchanged by the Corporation for shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be appropriately readjusted as if such stockholder rights had not been issued, but the Corporation had instead issued the shares of Common Stock issued upon such exchange as a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock subject to Subdivision 13(j)(ii).
.
(k) Reorganization Events
(i) In the event that there occurs:
(A) any consolidation, merger or other business combination of the Corporation with or into another Person;
(B) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation;
(C) any reclassification, recapitalization or reorganization of the Corporation; or
(D) any statutory exchange of the outstanding shares of Common Stock for securities of another Person (other than in connection with a consolidation, merger or other business combination);
and in each case, the holders of the Common Stock receive stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) with respect to or in exchange for the Common Stock (any such event or transaction, a "") each share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, without notice to or consent of the Holder(s) and subject to Subdivision 13(k)(v), become convertible (but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be automatically converted in connection with such Reorganization Event) into the kind of securities, cash and other property received in such Reorganization Event by the holders of the Common Stock (other than the counterparty to the Reorganization Event or an Affiliate of such counterparty) (such securities, cash and other property, the "").
Reorganization Event
Exchange Property
(ii) In the event that holders of the shares of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the consideration that the Holder(s) are entitled to receive upon conversion shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by a majority of the holders of the shares of Common Stock that did make an affirmative election.
 
(iii) The above provisions of this Subdivision 13(k) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Subdivision 13(j) shall apply to any shares of capital stock received by the holders of Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.
(iv) The Corporation (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the consummation of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holder(s) of such consummation of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Subdivision 13(k).
(v) The Corporation shall not enter into any agreement for a transaction constituting a Reorganization Event unless:
(A) such agreement provides for, or does not interfere with or prevent (as applicable), conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into the Exchange Property in a manner that is consistent with and gives effect to this Subdivision 13(k); and
(B) to the extent that the Corporation is not the surviving corporation in such Reorganization Event or will be dissolved in connection with such Reorganization Event, proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such Reorganization Event for the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into stock of the Person surviving such Reorganization Event or, in the case of a Reorganization Event described in Subdivision 13(k)(i)(B), an exchange of Series A Preferred Stock for the stock of the Person to whom the Corporation's assets are conveyed or transferred, and such stock of the Person surviving such Reorganization Event or to whom the Corporation's assets are conveyed or transferred shall have voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights as nearly equal as possible to those provided in this Certificate of Incorporation.
(l) Holder's Right to Convert Upon a Make-Whole Acquisition.
(i) In addition to any other rights of conversion set forth herein, in the event a Make-Whole Acquisition occurs, each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to convert all or any portion of such Holder's shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock during the period (the "") beginning on the effective date of the Make-Whole Acquisition (the "") and ending on the date that is 30 calendar days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date at the Applicable Conversion Rate, plus a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the "") determined pursuant to Subdivision 13(l)(ii), plus cash in lieu of

(A) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is between two Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts in the table or the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date is between two Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts and the two Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(B) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is in excess of $[] per share (subject to adjustment pursuant to Subdivision 13(j)), no Additional Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock;
(C) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is less than $[] per share (subject to adjustment pursuant to Subdivision 13(j)), no Additional Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock; and
 
 
 
(D) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date is after the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date, then the number of Additional Shares will be determined by reference to the last row in the table.
The Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices set forth in the table above shall be adjusted pursuant to Subdivision 13(j) as of any date the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices will equal the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. Each of the number of Additional Shares in the table shall also be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Subdivision 13(j).
(iii) On or before the 20th calendar day prior to the date the Corporation anticipates the Make-Whole Acquisition being consummated or within two Business Days of becoming aware of a Make-Whole Acquisition of the type set forth in clause (i) of the definition of Make-Whole Acquisition, a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holder(s) as they appear in the records of the Corporation.

(v) To exercise its Make-Whole Acquisition conversion right pursuant to this Subdivision 13(l), a Holder must, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on or before the date specified in the notice sent pursuant to Subdivision 13(l)(iv), comply with the procedures set forth in Subdivision 13(i), and indicate that it is exercising its Make-Whole Acquisition conversion right pursuant to this Subdivision 13(l).
(vi) If a Holder does not elect to exercise its Make-Whole Acquisition conversion right pursuant to this Subdivision 13(l), the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or successor security held by it shall remain outstanding (unless otherwise converted as provided herein), but the Holder will not be eligible to receive Additional Shares.
(vii) Upon a Make-Whole Acquisition conversion, the Conversion Agent shall, except as otherwise provided in the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in the written notice provided to the Corporation or its successor as set forth in Subdivision 13(l)(v), deliver to the Holder such cash, securities or other property as are issuable with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted.
