Exhibit 99.1
 
Xerox Reports Third-Quarter 2011 Earnings
 
 
 
 
 
NORWALK, Conn., Oct. 25, 2011  Xerox Corporation (NYSE: XRX) announced today third-quarter 2011 results that include adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents, up 18 percent from third-quarter 2010. Adjusted EPS excludes 4 cents related to the amortization of intangibles, resulting in GAAP EPS of 22 cents.
"We delivered steady revenue growth this quarter along with earnings and cash in line with our expectations," said Ursula Burns, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer. "Our consistent performance positions us well to grow full-year adjusted EPS by 15 to 18 percent, reflecting our global strengths in business process and document management and the efficiencies we're driving across our enterprise."
Third-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion was up 3 percent or 1 percent in constant currency. Revenue from technology, representing the sale of document systems, supplies, technical service and financing of products, was up 1 percent or down 1 percent in constant currency. "Supply constraints due to the natural disaster in Japan have eased considerably," noted Burns. "As we continue to meet new demand, all while reducing our backlog, we're confident these challenges are entirely behind us."
Revenue from services was up 6 percent or 5 percent in constant currency, reflecting growth in business process and document outsourcing, while revenue from IT outsourcing was flat. Signings for Xerox's services were very strong, totaling $3.9 billion in the third quarter  an increase of 33 percent from third quarter 2010, and down 9 percent on a trailing 12-month basis due to the cyclicality of large deals.
"Our services-led, technology-driven approach gives us a competitive advantage in the many markets we serve, especially as businesses and governments seek more efficient ways to run their operations and turn to Xerox for the long term benefits of our outsourcing expertise." said Burns.
"Backed by a growing pipeline, our increasing services signings boost our annuity stream and contribute to a strong revenue base. Notable in the quarter was 12 percent revenue growth in our document outsourcing business as we continue to lead the industry with our broad-based managed print services, and 6 percent growth in business process outsourcing.
"As demand increased for services, we did see an impact on gross margin, which we continued to offset with cost reductions and operational improvements that helped deliver solid bottom-line results," she added.
Third-quarter gross margin was 32.7 percent, and selling, administrative and general expenses were 19.9 percent of revenue. Operating margin of 9.6 percent was up 0.4 points from third-quarter 2010.
Xerox generated $366 million in operating cash flow during the third quarter. As planned, the company resumed its stock buyback program during the third quarter, repurchasing $309 million in Xerox shares with approximately $400 million more expected in the fourth quarter.
Xerox expects fourth-quarter 2011 GAAP earnings per share of 28 cents to 31 cents, resulting in full-year GAAP earnings per share of 92 cents to 95 cents. Fourth-quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be 32 cents to 35 cents per share, delivering full-year adjusted EPS of $1.08 to $1.11.

Financial Review
Revenues
 
Third quarter 2011 total revenues increased 3% compared to the third quarter 2010, including a 2-percentage point positive impact from currency. Total revenues included the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An analysis of the change in revenue for each business segment is included in the "Segment Review" section.
Costs, Expenses and Other Income
Summary of Key Financial Ratios
The following is a summary of key financial ratios used to assess our performance:
 
Third quarter 2011 operating margin
3
of 9.6% increased 0.4-percentage points as compared to the third quarter 2010. The increase was primarily due to disciplined cost and expense management.
Gross Margin
Gross margin of 32.7% decreased 0.9-percentage points, as compared to the third quarter 2010. The decrease was driven by the ramping of new services contracts, the line of business mix within the Services segment and the higher mix of Services revenue.
Technology gross margin decreased by 0.6-percentage points as compared to the third quarter 2010, due primarily to a lower supplies margin driven by mix within supplies sales. Price erosion was more than offset by the impact of cost productivities and restructuring savings.
Services gross margin decreased by 0.9-percentage points as compared to the third quarter 2010, due primarily to the ramping of new services contracts within BPO and ITO as well as the line of business mix within the Services segment.
Research, Development and Engineering Expenses ("RD&E")
Third quarter 2011 RD&E as a percent of revenue of 3.3% decreased 0.2-percentage points from the third quarter 2010. In addition to lower spending, the decrease was driven by the positive mix impact of the continued growth in Services revenue, which historically has a lower RD&E percent of revenue.
RD&E of $183 million in the third quarter 2011 was $6 million lower than the third quarter 2010, reflecting the impact of restructuring and productivity improvements. Innovation is one of our core strengths and we continue to invest at levels that enhance this core strength, particularly in color, software and services. Xerox R&D is strategically coordinated with Fuji Xerox.
 
Selling, Administrative and General Expenses ("SAG")
SAG as a percent of revenue of 19.9% decreased 1.0-percentage points from the third quarter 2010. In addition to spending reductions including lower compensation, the decrease was driven by positive mix impact from the continued growth in Services revenue, which historically has a lower SAG percent of revenue.
SAG Expenses of $1,109 million in the third quarter 2011 were $27 million lower than the third quarter 2010. There was a $26 million unfavorable impact from currency for the quarter. SAG expenses reflect the following:
 
 
 
Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges
During the third quarter 2011, we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment credits of $4 million, primarily resulting from net reversals and changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives. During the third quarter 2010, we recorded $4 million of net restructuring and asset impairment charges for actions primarily in North America.
The restructuring reserve balance as of September 30, 2011, for all programs was $126 million, of which approximately $119 million is expected to be spent over the next twelve months.
Acquisition Related Costs
Acquisition related costs associated with our acquisition of ACS were $5 million in the third quarter 2010. These costs primarily represent incremental external costs directly related to the integration of ACS and Xerox.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
During the third quarter 2011, we recorded $87 million of expense related to the amortization of intangible assets, which is $2 million higher than third quarter 2010.
Worldwide Employment
Worldwide employment of 134,200 at September 30, 2011 decreased approximately 2,300 from year-end 2010, primarily due to restructuring related actions more than offsetting the impact of acquisitions.
 
Other Expenses, Net
 
Non-Financing Interest Expense
Third quarter 2011 non-financing interest expense of $60 million was $27 million lower than third quarter 2010 primarily reflecting a lower average debt balance due to the redemption of the $550 million 2013 Senior Notes in October 2010 and other repayments of debt, as well as the benefit of lower borrowing costs achieved as a result of utilizing the commercial paper program.
Gains on Sales of Businesses and Assets
Third quarter 2010 gains on sales of businesses and assets of $15 million was related primarily to the sale of a facility in Latin America.
Currency Losses, net
Third quarter 2011 currency losses of $10 million were primarily due to the significant movement in exchange rates during the quarter among the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Yen and several developing market currencies.
Income Taxes
Third quarter 2011 effective tax rate was 22.1%. On an adjusted basis
3
, third quarter 2011 tax rate was 25.1%, which was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to geographical mix of profits as well as a higher foreign tax credit benefit as a result of our decision to repatriate current year income from certain non U.S. subsidiaries.
Third quarter 2010 effective tax rate was 29.9%. On an adjusted basis
3
, third quarter 2010 tax rate was 31.8%, which was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the net tax benefits from the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in these jurisdictions as well as the settlement and remeasurement of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits. These benefits were partially offset by the incremental U.S. tax cost on foreign income.
Xerox operations are widely dispersed. The statutory tax rate in most non U.S. jurisdictions is lower than the combined U.S. and state tax rate. The amount of income subject to these lower foreign rates relative to the amount of U.S. income will impact our effective tax rate. However, no one country
 
outside of the U.S. is a significant factor to our overall effective tax rate. Certain foreign income is subject to U.S. tax net of any available foreign tax credits. Our full year estimated effective tax rate includes a benefit of approximately 9 percentage points from these non U.S. operations which is comparable to 2010.
Our effective tax rate is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our effective tax rate will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events that may not be predictable. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2011 will be approximately 29%, excluding the effects of intangibles amortization and discrete events.
Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates
Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates, which primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox net income, was $43 million, an increase of $17 million compared to third quarter 2010.
Third quarter 2011 equity income includes charges of $1 million related to our share of Fuji Xerox after-tax restructuring compared to $6 million of charges for the third quarter 2010.
Net Income
Third quarter 2011 net income attributable to Xerox was $320 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis
3
, net income attributable to Xerox was $374 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. Third quarter 2011 adjustments to net income include amortization of intangible assets.
Third quarter 2010 net income attributable to Xerox was $250 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis
3
, net income attributable to Xerox was $314 million, or $0.22 per diluted share.
The Net Income and EPS reconciliation table in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section contains the third quarter adjustments to net income.
The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are included as Appendix I.See Non-GAAP financial measures for calculation of adjusted EPS.
 
Segment Review
 
Refer to Appendix II for the reconciliation of Segment Profit to Pre-tax Income.
Technology
Our Technology segment includes the sale of products and supplies, as well as the associated technical service and financing of those products.
Revenue
 
Third quarter 2011 Technology revenue of $2,500 million increased 1% from the third quarter 2010, including a 2-percentage point positive impact from currency. Revenue results included the following:
 
 
 
Segment Margin
Third quarter 2011 Technology segment margin of 10.3% increased 0.3 percentage points from third quarter 2010. Lower cost and expense from restructuring savings in addition to an increase in equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates more than offset the gross margin decline.
Installs
Entry
 
Mid-Range
 
 
High-End
 
 
Note: Install activity percentages include installations for Document Outsourcing and the Xerox-branded products shipped to GIS. "Entry", "Mid-Range" and "High-End" are defined in Appendix II.
Services
Our Services segment comprises three service offerings: Document Outsourcing ("DO"), Business Process Outsourcing ("BPO") and Information Technology Outsourcing ("ITO").
Revenue
Third quarter 2011 Services total revenue of $2,717 million increased 6%, including a 1-percentage point positive impact from currency.
 
 
 
 
Segment Margin
Third quarter 2011 Services segment margin of 11.9% increased 0.7-percentage points from third quarter 2010. Lower cost and expense from productivity and restructuring savings more than offset the gross margin decline.
Metrics
Pipeline
Our total services sales pipeline, including synergy opportunities, grew 5% over the third quarter 2010. This sales pipeline includes the Total Contract Value ("TCV") of new business opportunities that potentially could be contracted within the next six months and excludes business opportunities with estimated annual recurring revenue in excess of $100 million.
Signings
Signings are defined as estimated future revenues from contracts signed during the period, including renewals of existing contracts. Services signings were an estimated $3.9 billion in TCV for the quarter.
 
 
 
Signings increased 33% from the third quarter 2010, driven by strong growth across all three service offerings. Signings decreased 9% on a trailing twelve month basis as compared to the comparable prior year period driven by the cyclicality of large deals. Signings continued to trend positively, increasing sequentially for the second straight quarter.
Note: TCV is estimated total revenue for future contracts for pipeline or signed contracts for signings as applicable.
Other
Revenue
Third quarter 2011 Other revenue of $366 million decreased 10%, including a 3-percentage point positive impact from currency due to a decline in paper sales, wide format systems and other supplies partially offset by an increase in network integration and electronic presentation systems. Paper comprised approximately 60% of the third quarter 2011 Other segment revenue.
Segment Margin
Third quarter 2011 Other loss of $86 million increased $7 million from third quarter 2010, primarily driven by the revenue declines referenced above and partially offset by a decline in SAG expense.
Notes
 
 
 
 
Capital Resources and Liquidity
The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:
 
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $366 million in the third quarter 2011, which was flat from third quarter 2010 primarily due to the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In September 2011, we also elected to make a US pension contribution of 16.6 million shares of our common stock, with an aggregate value of approximately $130 million, to meet our planned level of funding for 2011.
 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $167 million in the third quarter 2011. The $99 million decrease in the use of cash from third quarter 2010 was primarily due to the following:
 
 
 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $492 million in the third quarter 2011. The $261 million increase in the use of cash from third quarter 2010 was primarily due to the following:
 
 
Customer Financing Activities
The following represents our Total finance assets, net associated with our lease and finance operations:
 
The decrease of $290 million in Total finance assets, net includes favorable currency of $42 million.
 
The following summarizes our debt:
 
 
 
Our lease contracts permit customers to pay for equipment over time rather than at the date of installation; therefore, we maintain a certain level of debt (that we refer to as financing debt) to support our investment in these lease contracts, which are reflected in Total finance assets, net. For this financing aspect of our business, we maintain an assumed 7:1 leverage ratio of debt to equity as compared to our finance assets. Based on this leverage, the following represents the breakdown of total debt between financing debt and core debt:
 
 
Sales of Accounts Receivables
We have facilities in the U.S., Canada and several countries in Europe that enable us to sell to third-parties, on an on-going basis, certain accounts receivable without recourse. The accounts receivables sold are generally short-term trade receivables with payment due dates of less than 60 days. Accounts receivable sales were as follows:
 
 
 
Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "will," "should" and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management's current beliefs, assumptions and expectations and are subject to a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. These factors include but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, environmental regulations and tax matters in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the outcome of litigation and regulatory proceedings to which we may be a party; actions of competitors; our ability to expand equipment placements and to drive the expanded use of color in printing and copying; development of new products and services; interest rates, cost of borrowing and access to credit markets; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to maintain and improve cost efficiency of operations, including savings from restructuring actions; the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred; reliance on third parties for manufacturing of products and provision of services; the risk that we will not realize all of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services, Inc.; our ability to recover capital investments; the risk that subcontractors, software vendors and utility and network providers will not perform in a timely, quality manner; the risk that multi-year contracts with governmental entities could be terminated prior to the end of the contract term; the risk that individually identifiable information of customers, clients and employees could be inadvertently disclosed or disclosed as a result of a breach of our security; and other factors that are set forth in the "Risk Factors" section, the "Legal Proceedings" section, the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section and other sections of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011 and our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as required by law.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In addition, we have discussed the non-GAAP measures described below. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth below as well as in the 2011 third quarter presentation slides available at .
www.xerox.com/investor
These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted Earnings Measures
To better understand the trends in our business and the impact of the ACS acquisition, we believe it is necessary to adjust the following amounts determined in accordance with GAAP to exclude the effects of the certain items as well as their related income tax effects. In 2011, adjustments are expected to be limited to the amortization of intangible assets and other discrete items.
Note:
 
 
 
The above have been adjusted for the following items:
 
 
 
 
In addition to the above excluded items, operating income and margin also exclude other expenses, net. Other expenses, net is primarily composed of non-financing interest expense.
Constant Currency
To better understand trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to adjust revenue to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to this adjusted revenue as "constant currency." Currencies for developing market countries (Latin America, Brazil, Middle East, India, Eurasia and Central-Eastern Europe) that we operate in are reported at actual exchange rates for both actual and constant revenue growth rates because (1) these countries historically have had volatile currency and inflationary environments and (2) our subsidiaries in these countries have historically taken pricing actions to mitigate the impact of inflation and devaluation. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current periods' results against the corresponding prior periods' results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.
 
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth on the following tables:
Net Income and EPS reconciliation:
 
 
Average shares for the calculation of adjusted EPS for the third quarter 2011 were 1,453 million and include 27 million shares associated with the Series A convertible preferred stock and therefore the quarterly dividend of $6 million is excluded. Third quarter 2010 shares of 1,444 million also include the 27 million shares associated with the Series A convertible preferred stock and the quarterly dividend of $6 million was excluded. We evaluate the dilutive effect of the Series A convertible preferred stock on an "if-converted" basis.
