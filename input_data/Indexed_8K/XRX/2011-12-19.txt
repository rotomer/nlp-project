On December 16, 2011, Xerox Corporation ("Xerox" or "we") refinanced its $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was executed in April 2007 (the "2007 Credit Facility"). This new $2 billion facility is a five year commitment maturing in 2016 with a group of lenders that includes affiliates of Citibank, N.A., J.P Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and BNP Paribas as lead arrangers and bookrunners (the "New Facility"). A majority of the lenders that participated in the 2007 Credit Facility are participating in the New Facility. Pricing, which is determined from a ratings grid based on our public debt ratings, includes a borrowing rate of LIBOR + 1.175% and an annual commitment fee of 20 bps, based on our current ratings. The New Facility contains a $300 million letter of credit subfacility, and also includes an accordion feature that would allow us to increase (from time to time, with willing lenders) the overall size of the facility up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.75 billion. We have the right to request a one year extension on each of the first and second anniversary dates.
The New Facility provides a backstop to Xerox's publicly registered $2 billion commercial paper program. Proceeds from any borrowings under the New Facility would be used to provide working capital for Xerox and its subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes.
Our obligations under the New Facility are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. However, if in the future any of our domestic subsidiaries guarantee any debt for money borrowed by Xerox of more than $100 million, that subsidiary is required to guaranty Xerox's obligations under the New Facility as well. In the event any of our subsidiaries borrows under the New Facility, its borrowings thereunder would be guaranteed by Xerox.
The New Facility contains various affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants, conditions to borrowing and events of default.
The foregoing description of the terms and conditions of the New Facility is not complete and is in all respects subject to the actual provisions of the New Facility, a copy of which has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The lenders or their affiliates have in the past engaged, and may in the future engage, in transactions with and perform services, including commercial banking, financial advisory and investment banking services, for Xerox and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses.
 
Information reported under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference in response to this Item 1.02.

Each such notice of a Borrowing (a "") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telecopier in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, initial Interest Period and currency for each such Advance.

Notice of Borrowing
(b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Borrowers may not select Eurocurrency Rate Advances for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than the Borrowing Minimum or if the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12 and (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than ten separate Borrowings.

(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02, and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower requesting the Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent

If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.
(e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

SECTION 2.13. .

Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be; , , that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies.

provided
 
(iii) if the Ratable Shares of Letters of Credit of the Non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.20(a), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(i) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders' Ratable Shares of Letters of Credit;
(iv) if any Defaulting Lender's Ratable Share of Letters of Credit is neither Cash Collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.20(a), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit fees payable under Section 2.04(b)(i) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Ratable Share of Letters of Credit shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such Defaulting Lender's Ratable Share of Letters of Credit is Cash Collateralized and/or reallocated; and

The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.20 are in addition to any other rights and remedies which the Borrowers, the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.
(d) If the Borrowers, the Agent and each Issuing Bank agree in writing in their reasonable determination that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Advances of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Advances and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Ratable Share (without giving effect to Section 2.20(a)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of any Borrower while that Lender was
provided
 
a Defaulting Lender; and , , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender's having been a Defaulting Lender.
