Gretchen W. McClain Employment Letter
     On October 14, 2011, Xylem Inc. (the "Company") and Gretchen W. McClain entered into an employment letter (the "Employment Letter") setting forth the terms and conditions of her employment as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective upon the consummation of the previously announced spin-off of the Company from ITT Corporation (the "Spin-Off"). Pursuant to the letter, Ms. McClain is entitled to a beginning annual base salary of $900,000 and is also eligible for a 2012 target annual incentive equal to 100% of her base salary and a 2012 target long-term incentive compensation opportunity equal to $3,400,000. The letter also provides that Ms. McClain will receive a Founders' Grant in connection with the Spin-Off composed of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock units with terms set forth in the Employment Letter and having an aggregate value of $5,100,000. If the Company terminates her employment other than for cause (as defined in the Employment Letter) and other than as a result of her death or disability, in any case prior to her normal retirement date, she will, subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in the Employment Letter, be entitled to severance pay in an amount equal to two times the sum of her then-current annual base salary and target annual incentive payable in installments over 24 months and will also be entitled to receive certain benefits during that time. The description above of the terms and conditions of Ms. McClain's employment letter with the Company is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment Letter, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
