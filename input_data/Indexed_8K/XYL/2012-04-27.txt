This Report is being filed to correct previous disclosure in the Company's Proxy Statement filed on March 29, 2012. Under "Proposal 2Ratification of Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm," the Company stated that it has an agreement with its independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), which "limit[s] awards based on punitive or exemplary damages under the dispute resolution procedures." In fact, the Company's agreement with Deloitte does not include such a provision limiting damages. The agreement expressly states that dispute resolution "shall apply to the fullest extent of the law, whether in contract, statute, tort (such as negligence), or otherwise."
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
