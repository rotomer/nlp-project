Company completes second acquisition in 2012 with the purchase of Heartland Pump, bolstering industrial dewatering portfolio
November 1, 2012  Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company focused on solving the world's most challenging water issues, today reported third quarter revenue of $931 million, up 3 percent on a constant currency basis, down 1 percent as reported from the third quarter 2011. Third quarter net income was $72 million or $0.38 per share, down $0.04 per share from the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time separation costs resulting from the Xylem spinoff from ITT Corporation on October 31, 2011, and special items, net income was $83 million or $0.44 per share, down $0.01 per share over the third quarter 2011 on a normalized basis.*
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.,
"As we mark our first anniversary as a stand-alone water company, our performance showcases both the strength of our global portfolio, with 9 percent constant currency revenue growth in the emerging markets, and our strategic focus on margin expansion through the execution of our Customer Excellence sales initiative and cost discipline," said Gretchen McClain, President and Chief Executive Officer of Xylem. "We're also seeing the benefit of our investments in acquisitions. Just last week we completed the purchase of Heartland Pump, which expands our
 
U.S. reach in dewatering rental and service, and grows our presence in industrial markets. And our two other recent acquisitions, YSI and MJK Automation, both continue to perform well and help establish our Analytics business as a long-term growth platform."
McClain said the company continues to move forward with restructuring and realignment initiatives, and now foresees approximately $20 million in aggregated costs during 2012 to position the business for future growth. The company maintains its outlook for full-year 2012 revenue of $3.8 billion, and has revised the mid-point of its 2012 earnings guidance to $1.76 from $1.77 per share to reflect the $0.01 per share dilutive impact of the Heartland Pump acquisition.

(the "Company") from ITT Corporation, the terms and the effect of the separation, the nature and impact of the separation, capitalization of the Company, future strategic plans and other statements that describe the Company's business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals, and any discussion of future operating or financial performance. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to orders, sales, operating margins and earnings per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating results  are forward-looking statements.
Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in, or reasonably inferred from, such statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Management views key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, free cash flow, working capital, and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:
defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, intercompany transactions, and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales of portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation or insignificant portions of our business that we did not classify as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency fluctuations assumes no change in exchange rates from the prior period.
"Organic revenue" and "Organic orders"
defined as financial results adjusted for currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
"Constant currency"
defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization expense, and share-based compensation. reflects the adjustment to EBITDA to exclude for non-recurring separation costs associated with the Xylem spin-off from ITT Corporation as well as non-recurring restructuring and realignment costs.
"EBITDA"
"Adjusted EBITDA"
defined as operating income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude non-recurring separation costs associated with the Xylem spin-off from ITT Corporation, non-recurring restructuring and realignment costs and tax-related special items.
"Adjusted Operating Income", "Adjusted Segment Operating Income", and "Adjusted EPS"
defined as adjusted earnings per share, as well as adjustments to reflect the incremental current period amount of interest expense and stand alone costs in the prior comparable period.
"Normalized EPS"
defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flow, less capital expenditures as well as adjustments for other significant items that impact current results which management believes are not related to our ongoing operations and performance. Our definition of free cash flows does not consider non-discretionary cash payments, such as debt.
"Free Cash Flow"
