Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SUNNYVALE, Calif.January 15, 2003
Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2002. Net revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $285.8 million, a 51 percent increase over the $188.9 million reported in the same period in 2001.
        Net income on a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $46.2 million or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $8.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share for the same period in 2001. Assuming the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 ("FAS 142") "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" had occurred at the beginning of 2001, Yahoo! would have reported a net profit for the fourth quarter of 2001 of $6.8 million or $0.01 per diluted share.
        EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense) for the quarter was $85.3 million or 30 percent of net revenues, compared to $11.7 million, or 6 percent of net revenues, for the same period in 2001, which included $16.8 million of restructuring costs. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $61.4 million compared to a free cash flow loss of $6.4 million for the same period in 2001. Free cash flow is the Company's EBITDA plus non-operating cash income, less taxes paid, investments in working capital and capital expenditures. The Company considers EBITDA and free cash flow to be important measures of the Company's performance because they reflect the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock.
        Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $953.1 million, a 33 percent increase over the $717.4 million reported in 2001.
        Reported GAAP income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $106.9 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to a reported net loss of $92.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share for 2001. The Company's adoption of FAS 142 in the first quarter of 2002 resulted in a non-cash charge of $64.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Assuming the Company had adopted FAS 142 at the beginning of 2001, reported net loss for the year ended December 31, 2001 before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle would have been $36.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share.
        EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $206.0 million compared with an EBITDA loss of $18.6 million for 2001, which included $62.2 million of restructuring and acquisition related costs. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $221.0 million compared to a $26.6 million free cash flow loss in 2001.
        "Over the last twelve months we have executed against a business plan which has taken Yahoo! from a company with tremendous potential to one with multiple strong businesses from which we believe we can continue to build a sustainable long-term future. We experienced growth in both our existing businesses and newer areas and we continue to demonstrate the capability of our business model to generate cash flow and to scale. As we begin 2003 we believe we are in a strong position to continue to deliver profitable, sustainable long-term growth and I'm excited to build on our success in the upcoming year," said Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer, Yahoo! Inc.
Business Outlook
        "I am very pleased with the significant progress we have made on our strategic and financial goals in 2002. As we move into 2003, we continue to focus on maximizing long-term free cash flow per share," said Susan Decker, chief financial officer, Yahoo! Inc. "Our long-term financial strategy of attracting significantly more revenue from our growing user base without commensurately increasing our expense appears to be gaining traction. In 2003, we expect strong growth in revenue, profitability, and free cash flow even as we continue to invest in areas that we expect will drive long-term growth."

Fourth Quarter 2002 Financial Highlights
        
Revenues
: In the fourth quarter of 2002, Yahoo! reported net revenues of $285.8 million, a 51 percent increase from the same period in 2001. Excluding HotJobs related revenues that resulted from the acquisition completed in early 2002, revenues increased 39 percent over the same period in 2001.
        Marketing Services revenues totaled $177.5 million, a 31 percent increase from the same period in 2001. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in revenues from small-to-medium sized companies realized through Yahoo!'s sponsored search services and inside sales organization, partially offset by a decrease in barter revenues.
        Fees and Listings revenues totaled $89.4 million, a 120 percent increase compared to the same period in 2001. Excluding HotJobs revenues, the increase was 65 percent. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in paying customers for Yahoo!'s fee- and listings-based services, including Yahoo! Personals and the new SBC Yahoo! Dial and DSL products.
        Transactions revenues totaled $19.0 million, a 45 percent increase compared to the same period in 2001. This increase was driven primarily by increased commerce transactions enabled on the Yahoo! network and a change in the Company's pricing for the Yahoo! Store platform from a fixed fee- to a transaction-based structure.
        United States revenues for the quarter totaled $242.4 million, a 53 percent increase compared to the same period in 2001. International revenues were $43.4 million, a 45 percent increase compared to the same period in 2001. International revenues represented 15 percent of total revenues for this quarter and 16 percent for the same period in 2001.
        
EBITDA
: In the fourth quarter of 2002, Yahoo! reported EBITDA of $85.3 million or 30 percent of net revenues, versus $11.7 million or 6 percent of net revenues reported for the same period in 2001. Excluding the $16.8 million in restructuring costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, EBITDA for that period would have been $28.5 million or 15 percent of net revenues. The favorable comparison to the same period in the prior year is primarily the result of the $96.9 million, or 51 percent revenue increase as described above, combined with costs growing at a slower pace. Recurring costs and expenses included in EBITDA increased only $40.1 million or 25 percent, primarily as a result of ongoing costs and expenses associated with HotJobs being brought into Yahoo!'s cost structure, in addition to increases in total compensation related and marketing expenses from investments in areas that the Company believes will drive long-term growth.
        United States EBITDA for the quarter was $82.0 million, or 34 percent of United States net revenues, which compares favorably to $18.0 million, or 11 percent of United States net revenues reported for the same period in 2001. International EBITDA for the quarter was $3.3 million, compared to a $6.3 million EBITDA loss reported for the same period in 2001.
        
Depreciation and Amortization
: Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $23.3 million, a $5.7 million increase compared to the same period in 2001. The increase primarily resulted from the HotJobs acquisition and depreciation on the Sunnyvale headquarters facility, which was converted from a synthetic lease to property and equipment during the third quarter of 2002.
        Amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $5.9 million, a $12.6 million reduction from the same period in 2001, primarily resulting from the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of FAS 142, partially offset by additional intangible amortization expense as a result of the HotJobs acquisition.
        
Other income, net
: In the fourth quarter of 2002, Yahoo! reported other income, net, of $20.2 million, which is slightly below the $21.5 million recorded in the same period of 2001 and reflects the decrease in interest income related to a decline in interest rates.
Leading Internet Brand and Global Audience
        Yahoo!'s brand leadership and broad audience support the Company's leadership position and success in efforts to build deeper relationships with consumers. Yahoo! continues to be the Internet brand of choice, ranking No. 1 in brand strength with U.S. consumers according to Brand Asset Valuator (Young & Rubicam, December 2002), providing a strong basis for increasing consumer loyalty and usage.
        During the quarter, Nielsen//NetRatings (November 2002) ranked Yahoo!'s global network the world's most trafficked Internet destination for the 30 consecutive month, based on unique audience, total time spent, reach, and total page views. In addition, Yahoo! was recognized as the most trafficked Internet brand in the United States, with the greatest breadth of usage, having 20 Yahoo! properties ranked among the top three in their respective vertical categories.
th
        Yahoo!'s global audience, excluding Yahoo! Japan, was approximately 213 million unique users in December 2002 compared to approximately 188 million in December 2001. In addition, approximately 101 million active registered users, excluding Yahoo! Japan, logged onto Yahoo's global network during December 2002, compared to approximately 74 million in December 2001.
        "Yahoo!'s industry-leading loyal user base continues to grow both in size and in depth. Consumers are expanding their relationship with Yahoo! both in time spent and pages consumed, underscoring one of our key objectives to continue to develop stronger relationships with our audience. As we continue to execute on our strategic and financial goals, we will concentrate on total product quality, superior ease-of-use and increased product relevancy, enabling Yahoo! to further enrich the consumer experience and build on our already strong metrics," said Semel.
