Item 2.  Acquisitions and Dispositions.
 
On December 22, 2002, Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Inktomi Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Inktomi"), a
provider of OEM Web search and paid inclusion services, entered into an agreement under which the Company will acquire Inktomi for a purchase price of $1.65 per share in cash (the "Acquisition"). The Acquisition reflects an aggregate purchase price of approximately $279.5 million, adjusted for Inktomi's expected cash balance net of debt, as of December 31, 2002.  The Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and the approval of Inktomi's stockholders.  Although the Acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2003, there can be no assurance that the Acquisition will be completed in the first quarter of 2003, if at all.

Exhibit 99.1
 
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
                The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements have been prepared to give effect to the proposed merger of Yahoo! and Inktomi, using the purchase method of accounting, and Inktomi's divestiture of its Enterprise Search business and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements.  These pro forma statements were prepared as if these transactions had been completed as of January 1, 2001 for statements of operations purposes and as of September 30, 2002 for balance sheet purposes.
 
                The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have actually been reported had these transactions occurred on January 1, 2001 for statements of operations purposes and as of September 30, 2002 for balance sheet purposes, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future financial position or results of operations. The pro forma combined condensed financial statements include adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to reflect the allocation of purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Inktomi. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after the completion of the merger and will be based upon actual net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The preliminary purchase price allocation for Inktomi is subject to revision as more detailed analysis is completed and additional information on the fair values of Inktomi's assets and liabilities becomes available. Any change in the fair value of the net assets of Inktomi will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Additionally, changes in Inktomi's working capital, including the results of operations from September 30, 2002 through the date the transaction is completed, will change the amount of goodwill recorded. Final purchase accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments presented herein.
 
                These unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are based upon the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Yahoo! and Inktomi and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Yahoo! and Inktomi and related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in the reports and other information Yahoo! and Inktomi have on file with the SEC.

1. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
 
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
                On December 22, 2002, Yahoo! and Inktomi entered into a definitive agreement whereby Yahoo! will acquire Inktomi for a purchase price of $1.65 per share in cash for each share of Inktomi common stock outstanding upon the effective date of the merger. Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Inktomi common stock will be assumed using an exchange ratio based on the ten day trading average of Yahoo! common stock immediately preceding and excluding the effective date on which the merger closes using a $1.65 value. Based upon the current number of shares of Inktomi common stock and options outstanding, Yahoo! would make a cash payment of approximately $269.8 million and issue options to purchase approximately 900,000 shares of Yahoo! common stock. The actual amount of cash to be paid and Yahoo! options to be issued will be determined on the effective date of the merger based on the number of shares of Inktomi common stock and options actually outstanding on such date and the exchange ratio.  Yahoo! will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting.
 
                The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at September 30, 2002 is presented to give effect to the proposed merger of Yahoo! and Inktomi and Inktomi's divestiture of its Enterprise Search business as if the transactions had been consummated on that date. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations of Yahoo! and Inktomi and Inktomi's divestiture of its Enterprise Search business for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the nine-months ended September 30, 2002 are presented as if the transactions had been consummated on January 1, 2001 and, due to different fiscal period ends, combines the historical results of Yahoo! for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the nine-months ended September 30, 2002, and the historical results of Inktomi and Inktomi's divestiture of its Enterprise Search business for the year ended September 30, 2001 and the nine-months ended September 30, 2002, respectively. Financial information for Inktomi and Inktomi's divestiture of its Enterprise Search business for the nine-months ended September 30, 2002 was derived by subtracting Inktomi's financial information for the three-months ended December 31, 2001 from the respective financial information for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.
 
                The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflect an estimated purchase price of approximately $279.5 million.  The preliminary cash payment was determined based on the current number of outstanding shares of Inktomi common stock.  The preliminary fair value of Yahoo! options to be issued was determined using the Black-Scholes model and the current number of outstanding Inktomi options.  The following assumptions were used to perform the calculations: expected life of 36 months, risk-free interest rate of 3.1%, expected volatility of 77% and no expected dividend yield.  As the actual amount of cash to be paid and Yahoo! options to be issued will be determined on the effective date of the merger based on the number of shares of Inktomi common stock and options actually outstanding on such date and the exchange ratio, the final amount of cash to be paid and Yahoo! options to be issued will not be determined until that date.  The estimated total purchase price of the proposed Inktomi merger is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 
    The final purchase price is dependent on the actual amount of cash to be paid, the actual number of options assumed and actual direct merger costs.  The final purchase price will be determined upon completion of the merger.  Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price is allocated to Inktomi's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of completion of the merger.  Based upon the estimated purchase price and the preliminary independent valuation, the preliminary purchase price allocation, which is subject to change based on Yahoo!'s final analysis, is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
                A preliminary estimate of $52.3 million has been allocated to amortizable intangible assets consisting of customer contracts and developed technology with useful lives not exceeding five years.
 
A preliminary estimate of $168.2 million has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually. The preliminary purchase price allocation for Inktomi is subject to revision as more detailed analysis is completed and additional information on the fair values of Inktomi's assets and liabilities becomes available. Any change in the fair value of the net assets of Inktomi will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Final purchase accounting adjustments may therefore differ materially from the pro forma adjustments presented here.
 
2. Pro Forma Adjustments
 
                Certain reclassifications have been made to conform Inktomi's historical amounts to Yahoo!'s financial statement presentation.
 
                The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet has been prepared as if the merger was completed on September 30, 2002 for balance sheet purposes and as of January 1, 2001 for statements of operations purposes and reflect the following pro forma adjustments:
 
(a) To reflect Inktomi's divestiture of its Enterprise Search business to Verity, Inc. which was completed on December 17, 2002.
 
(b) To reflect the estimated cash payment for the proposed merger of $1.65 per outstanding Inktomi share and resulting decrease in interest income.
 
(c) To establish amortizable intangible assets and non-amortizable goodwill resulting from the proposed merger.
 
(d) To record estimated direct merger costs of approximately $3.3 million and restructuring charges of approximately $7.3 million to be incurred by Yahoo! and $6.7 million of estimated merger costs to be incurred by Inktomi directly related to the proposed acquisition by Yahoo!. Actual amounts could differ significantly upon close.
 
(e) To adjust Inktomi deferred revenue to estimated fair value.
 
(f) To eliminate the historical stockholders' equity of Inktomi and record the estimated fair value of Yahoo! options to be issued in the proposed merger.
 
 
(g) To eliminate Yahoo! revenues from Inktomi, for which the related costs are eliminated through inclusion within the sales and marketing caption in the Inktomi Divestiture adjustments.
 
(h) To eliminate the amortization of Inktomi historical goodwill and intangibles and reflect amortization of the amortizable intangible assets and deferred compensation resulting from the proposed merger.  The weighted average life of amortizable intangible assets approximates 4 years and the remaining vesting period of unvested employee stock options approximates 3.5 years.
 
(i) To adjust the provision (benefit) for taxes to reflect the impact of Inktomi's net loss and the pro forma adjustments.
 
3. Pro Forma Combined Net Income (Loss) Per Share
 
                Shares used to calculate unaudited pro forma combined net income (loss) per basic and diluted share were computed using Yahoo!'s weighted average shares outstanding during the respective periods.
