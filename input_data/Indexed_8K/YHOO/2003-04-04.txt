(Nasdaq:YHOO - ---- News) today announced the pricing of $750 million of Zero Coupon Senior - ---- Convertible Notes Due 2008 in a private offering. The notes are being offered to investors at 100 percent of their principal amount. The sale of the Notes is expected to close on April 9, 2003. The Notes will not bear interest, have a zero yield to maturity, and will be convertible into Yahoo! common stock at a conversion price of $41.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. This represents a 68 percent conversion premium based on the closing price of $24.36 of Yahoo! common stock on April 3, 2003. Each $1,000 principal amount at maturity will initially be convertible into 24.39 shares of Yahoo! common stock.

Yahoo! may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity. The Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes were placed in a private transaction pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.
