(c)        Neither the Trustee nor any of its agents shall (i) have any duty to monitor compliance with or with respect to any federal or state or other securities or tax laws or (ii) have any duty to obtain documentation on any transfers or exchanges other than as specifically required hereunder.
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of like tenor and Principal Amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
Section 3.06
.  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost And Stolen Securities. 
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a
bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like tenor and Principal Amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.

Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such notice shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.

(i)          during any fiscal quarter (beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2003) the Sale Price of the Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days in the 30 Trading Day period ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds 110% of the Conversion Price in effect as of the 30 Trading Day of that period; or
th
 
(ii)         during the period beginning January 1, 2008 through the Final Maturity Date, the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the immediately preceding Trading Day was 110% or more of the then current Conversion Price; or
 
(iii)        as provided in Section 13.01(b).
 
(b)        In addition, in the event that:
 
(i)        (A)      the Company distributes to Holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase Common Stock at less than the average Sale Price of the Common Stock for the 10 Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration for such distribution;
 
(B)         the Company distributes to Holders of Common Stock cash or other assets, debt securities or certain rights to purchase the Company's securities, which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company exceeding 15% of the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the declaration for such distribution; or
(C)         a Fundamental Change occurs but Holders of Securities do not have the right to require the Company to purchase their Securities as a result of such Fundamental Change, because of the provisions set forth in Section 11.02(a);
 
then, in each case, the Company must notify, in writing, Holders of Securities of the occurrence of such an event at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for any distribution specified in clauses (A) and (B) or within 30 days of the occurrence of the Fundamental Change specified in clause (C), as the case may be.  Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time (1) until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date or the date of announcement by the Company that the distribution will not take place, in the case of (A) and (B) above or (2) within 30 days of the Fundamental Change Company Notice, in the case of (C) above.  In the case of a (A) and (B) above, no adjustment shall be made to the ability of a Holder of Securities to convert if such Holder may participate in the distribution without conversion.
 
(ii)         the Company becomes party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company pursuant to which the Common Stock of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or other property, a Holder may surrender the Securities for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date of the transaction until 15 days after the actual date of the transaction. If the Company becomes party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or other property, then at the effective time of the transaction, the right to convert the Securities into Common Stock shall be changed into a right to convert a Security into the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property which the Holder would have received if the Holder had converted such Securities immediately prior to the transaction.  If the transaction also constitutes a Fundamental Change, the Holder shall have the rights set forth in Article 11 above.
 
(c)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice exercising such Holder's option to require the Company to repurchase such Security may be converted only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with Article 11 hereof prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be.
 
(a)  Each Security shall be convertible at the office of the Conversion Agent into fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Common Stock.  The Security will be converted into shares Common Stock at the Conversion Price therefor.
Section 13.02
.  Conversion Procedure. 
 
(b)        In order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any Securities in certificated form, the Holder of any such Securities to be converted, in whole or in part, shall:
(i)          complete and manually sign the conversion notice provided on the back of the Security (the "") and deliver such notice to a Conversion Agent;
Conversion Notice
 
(ii)         surrender the Security to a Conversion Agent;
 
(iii)        furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, if required; and
 
(iv)       pay any transfer or similar tax, if required.
 
The date on which the Holder satisfies all of the requirements set forth in (i) through (iv) above is the "."  Such notice shall also state the name or names (with address or addresses) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable on such conversion shall be issued. All such Securities surrendered for conversion shall, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as the registration of such Securities, be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder or his duly authorized attorney.
Conversion Date
 
In order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any interest in Securities in global form, the Holder must complete the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to the Depositary's book-entry conversion program, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Company or the Trustee or Conversion Agent, and pay the funds, if any, required by this Section 13.02 and any transfer taxes if required pursuant to Section 13.06.
 
(c)        As promptly as practicable after satisfaction of the requirements for conversion set forth above (but in no event later than 3 Business Days after the Conversion Date), subject to compliance with any restrictions on transfer if shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in a name other than that of the Holder (as if such transfer were a transfer of the Securities (or portion thereof) so converted), the Company shall issue and shall deliver to such Holder at the office of the Conversion Agent, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such Securities or portion thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Article and a check or cash in respect of any fractional interest in respect of a share of Common Stock arising upon such conversion, as provided in Section 13.03. In case any Securities of a denomination greater than $1,000 shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the Securities so surrendered, without charge to him, new Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Securities.
 
Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as to any such Securities (or portion thereof) on the date on which the requirements set forth above in this Section 13.02 have been satisfied as to such Securities (or portion thereof), and the person in whose name any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become on said date the Holder of record of the shares represented thereby; , , that in case of any such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, the person or persons in whose name the certificate or certificates for such shares are to be issued shall be deemed to have become the record Holder thereof for all purposes on the next day on which such stock transfer books are
provided
however
open, but such conversion shall be at the Conversion Price in effect on the date upon which such Securities shall be surrendered.
 
(d)        Upon the conversion of an interest in Global Securities, the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company) shall make a notation on such Global Securities as to the reduction in the Principal Amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversions of Securities effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
 
(e)        Each stock certificate representing Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Securities that are Restricted Securities shall bear the legend in substantially the form of hereto.
Exhibit C
 
Section 13.03
.  Cash Payments In Lieu Of Fractional Shares. 
The Company will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Securities. If multiple Securities shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered. If any fractional share of stock would be issuable upon the conversion of any Securities, the Company shall make payment therefor in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable multiplied by the Current Market Price (as defined in Section 13.05(g) to the Holder of Securities.
 
Section 13.04
.  Adjustment Of Conversion Price. 
The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
 
(a)        In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, pay a dividend or make a distribution in shares of Common Stock to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution.  Such reduction becomes effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 13.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(b)           In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, issue to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them (for a period of not more than 60 days after such issuance) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock) at a price per share (or having a conversion, exchange or exercise price per share) less than the Sale Price of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Price
 
shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the date of such announcement by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of announcement, plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such Sale Price of Common stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance determined by multiplying such total number of shares so offered by the exercise price of such rights or warrants and dividing the product so obtained by such Sale Price), and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of announcement plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase or into which convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, securities so offered are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable.
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date of announcement of such issuance.
 
To the extent that shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock) are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock) actually delivered.  In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed.  In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
(c)           In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased.  In each such case, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such subdivision or combination.  Such reduction or increase, as the case may be, shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
(d)           (i) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while the Securities are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock of the Company (other than any dividends or distributions to which Section 13.04(a) applies) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in Section 13.04(b), and excluding any dividend or distribution (x) paid exclusively in cash or (y) referred to in Section 13.04(a)) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 13.04(d) called the ""), then, in each such case, the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall be equal to the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction:
)
Distributed Securities
 
(A)        the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such Record Date less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) on the Record Date of the portion of the Distributed Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, and
 
(B)         the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock.
 
Such reduction shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such distribution.  If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 13.04(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price of the Common Stock.
 
Each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of securities pursuant to this Article 13 shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of common stock or preferred stock purchase rights, if any, as may be provided by the terms of any stockholder rights plan adopted by the Company (notwithstanding the occurrence of an event causing such rights to separate from the Common Stock at or prior to the time of conversion). Any distribution of rights or warrants pursuant to a stockholder rights plan complying with the requirements set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph shall not constitute a distribution of rights or warrants for the purposes of Section 13.04(b) or this Section 13.04(d).
 
(ii)           For the purposes of this  Section 13.04(d), Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (A) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (B) are not exercisable; and (C) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 13.04(d) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Price under this Section 13.04(d) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any
Trigger Event
is required) to the Conversion Price shall be made under this Section 13.04(d). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Price under this Section 13.04(d) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any Holders thereof, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all applicable holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
 
(iii)          For purposes of this Section 13.04(d) and Section 13.04(a), 13.04(b), and 13.04(c), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 13.04(d) is applicable that also includes (x) shares of Common Stock, (y) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock to which Section 13.04(b) applies (or any combination thereof), or (z) a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(c) applies or shall be deemed instead to be:
 
(A)          a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants, other than such shares of Common Stock, such rights or warrants or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or such subdivision or combination to which Section 13.04(a), 13.04(b), and 13.04(c) apply, respectively (and any Conversion Price reduction required by this Section 13.04(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), immediately followed by,
 
(B)           a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock, such rights or warrants or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or such subdivision or combination (and any further Conversion Price reduction required by Section 13.04(a), 13.04(b), and 13.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except:
 
(1)           the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as (x) "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution," and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a), (y) "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants," within the meaning of Section 13.04(b) and (z) "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" and "the day upon which such combination becomes effective" within the meaning of Section 13.04(c); and
 
(2)           any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a) and any reduction or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock resulting from such subdivision or combination shall be disregarded in connection with such dividend or distribution.
 
(e)           In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its shares of Common Stock, cash (excluding any cash that is distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which Section 13.05 applies or as part of a distribution referred to in Section 13.04(d)), in an aggregate amount that, combined together with:
 
(i)    the aggregate amount of any other such distributions to all holders of shares of Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution, and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this Section 13.04(e) has been made; and
 
(ii)   the aggregate amount of any cash, plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company) of other consideration paid in respect of any tender offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock concluded within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution, and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to Section 13.04(f) has been made;
 
exceeds 10% of the product of the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Record Date with respect to such distribution, times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date (such excess over 10%, the ""), then, and in each case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business of such Record Date by a fraction:
Excess Amount
 
(A)               the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on the Record Date, less an amount equal to the quotient of (y) the Excess Amount and (z) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date; and
(B)               the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on such date.
 
(f)            In case a tender offer made by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of Purchased Shares (as defined below)) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that combined together with:
 
(i)    the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors), as of the expiration of such tender offer, of any other consideration payable in respect of any other tender offers, by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this Section 13.04(f) has been made, and
 
(ii)   the aggregate amount of any distributions to all holders of shares of Common Stock made exclusively in cash within 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to Section 13.04(e) has been made;
 
exceeds 10% of the product of the Sale Price of the Common Stock as of the last time (the "") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended), times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time, then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the Expiration Time, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the product of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time and (2) the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time and the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time.  Such reduction (if any) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the Business Day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such tender offer had not been made. If the application of this Section 13.04(f) to any
Expiration Time
Purchased Shares
tender offer would result in an increase in the Conversion Price, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this Section 13.04(f).
 
(g)           For purposes of this Section 13.04, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated:
 
(1)           "" on any date means the average of the Sales Prices per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the day before the record date (or, if earlier, the Ex-Dividend date) with respect to any distribution, issuance or other event requiring such computation.
Current Market Price
 
(2)           "" shall mean the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm's length transaction.
fair market value
 
(3)           "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
 
(h)           The Company may make such decreases in the Conversion Price, in addition to any adjustments required by Section 13.04(a), 13.04(b), 13.04(c), 13.04(d), 13.04(e) or 13.04(f), as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
 
(i)            To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may decrease the Conversion Price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days, the decrease is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such decrease would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Price is decreased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to Holders of record of the Securities a notice of the decrease at least 15 days prior to the date the decreased Conversion Price takes effect, and such notice shall state the decreased Conversion Price and the period during which it will be in effect.
 
(j)            No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price; , , that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 13.04(j) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Article 13 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest. To the
provided
however
extent the Securities become convertible into cash, assets, property or securities (other than capital stock of the Company), no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash, assets, property or such securities. Interest will not accrue on the cash.
 
(k)           Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Price and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Price of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Price setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Price to each Holder of Securities at such Holder's last address appearing on the list of Security holders provided for in Section 3.05 of this Indenture, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
 
(l)            In any case in which this Section 13.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a Record Date for an event, the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Holder of any Securities converted after such Record Date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such Holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 13.03.
 
(m)          For purposes of this Section 13.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock so long as the Company does not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
 
(n)           No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made pursuant to this Section 13.04 if the Holders of the Securities may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 13.04.
 
  If any of the following events occur, namely:
.
Section 13.05
Effect Of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger Or Sale. 
 
(i)    any reclassification or change of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination, or any other change for which an adjustment is provided in Section 13.04(c));
 
(ii)   any consolidation or merger or combination to which the Company is a party other than a merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of, or change (other than in par value, or from par

(iii)  any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company to any other person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock
 
then the Company or the successor or purchasing person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that such Securities shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Securities (assuming, for such purposes, a sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock available to convert all such Securities) immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, assuming such holder of Common Stock did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance ( that, if the kind or amount of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised (""), then for the purposes of this Section 13.05, the kind and amount of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance for each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 13.  If, in the case of any such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, the stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.
provided
nonelecting share
 
The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the register of the Securities maintained by the Registrar, within 20 days after execution thereof.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.  The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances.  If this Section 13.05 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 13.04 shall not apply.
The issue of stock certificates on conversions of Securities shall be made without charge to the converting Holder for any documentary, transfer, stamp or any similar tax in respect of the issue thereof, and the Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of the Holder of any Securities converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
Section 13.06.
  Taxes On Shares Issued. 
 
The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for the conversion of the Securities from time to time as such Securities are presented for conversion (assuming that, at the time of the computation of such number of shares or securities, all such Securities would be held by a single Holder).
Section 13.07.
  Reservation Of Shares; Shares To Be Fully Paid; Compliance With Governmental Requirements; Listing Of Common Stock. 
 
Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.
 
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Securities shall be newly issued shares or Treasury shares, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free from any lien or adverse claim.
 
The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to list or cause to have quoted any shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of Securities on each national securities exchange or over-the-counter or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
 
The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine the Conversion Price or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Price, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Securities; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any
Section 13.08.
  Responsibility Of Trustee. 
Securities for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 13.05 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Securities after any event referred to in such Section 13.05 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.

Section 13.09

(d)           of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries;
 
then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent and to be mailed to each Holder of Securities at such Holder's address appearing on the list of Security holders provided for in Section 3.05 of this Indenture, as promptly as practicable but in any event at least 15 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

If the Company timely elects to pay cash for any portion of the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Holder, the Holder may retract the Conversion Notice at any time during the two Business Day period beginning on the day after the final day of the Cash Settlement Notice Period (a ""); no such retraction may be made (and a conversion notice shall be irrevocable) if the Company does not elect to deliver cash in lieu of shares (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares).  If the conversion notice has not been retracted, then settlement (in cash) will occur on the Business Day following the final Trading Day of the five Trading Day period beginning on the first Trading Day after the final day of the Conversion Retraction Period (the "").  Settlement amounts will be computed as follows:

(i)    if the Company elects to satisfy the Conversion Obligation in shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver to such Holder a number of shares of Common Stock equal to  the quotient of the aggregate original Principal Amount of the Securities to be converted divided by the Conversion Price;
 
(ii)   if the Company elects to satisfy the Conversion Obligation in cash, the Company will deliver to such Holder cash in an amount equal to the product of:

(B)         the average Sale Price of the Common Stock during the Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice exercising such Holder's option to require the Company to repurchase such Security may be converted as described in this Section 13.10(a) only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of Article 11 hereof.
 
(b)           If a Holder elects to convert all or any portion of a Security into shares of Common Stock after the Final Notice Date, the Company may choose to satisfy all of the Conversion Obligation in cash provided that the Company notifies such Holder through the Trustee of the dollar amount to be satisfied in cash at any time on or before the final day of the Cash Settlement Notice Period.  Settlement amounts will be computed and settlement dates will be determined in the same manner as set forth in (a) above except that the "Cash Settlement Averaging Period" shall be the 5 Trading Day period beginning on the first Trading Day after the Stated Maturity.  If the Company timely elects to pay cash for any portion of the shares of Common Stock
otherwise issuable to the Holder, the Holder may retract the Conversion Notice at any time during the Conversion Retraction Period; no such retraction may be made (and a conversion notice shall be irrevocable) if the Company does not elect to deliver cash in lieu of shares (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares).  If the conversion notice has not been retracted, then settlement (in cash) will occur on the Business Day following the final day of such Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
 
Any determination that the Company or the Board of Directors must make pursuant to this Article 13 shall be conclusive if made in good faith and in accordance with the provisions of this Article, absent manifest error, and set forth in a Board Resolution.

In calculating the Additional Interest Amount on any date on which no Notes are outstanding, the Conversion Price and the Additional Interest Amount payable with respect to shares of Common Stock that are Registrable Securities, shall be calculated as if the Notes were still outstanding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Additional Interest Amount shall accrue as to any Registrable Security from and

The Trustee shall be entitled, on behalf of registered holders of Notes or Underlying Common Stock, to seek any available remedy for the enforcement of this Agreement, including for the payment of such Additional Interest Amount.

Nothing shall preclude any Holder from pursuing or obtaining specific performance or other equitable relief with respect to this Agreement.
 
All of the Company's obligations set forth in this Section 2(e) that are outstanding with respect to any Registrable Security at the time such security ceases to be a Registrable Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such security have been satisfied in full (notwithstanding termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(k)).

Indemnification and Contribution

The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Notice Holder, each person, if any, who controls any Notice Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Notice Holder within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, subject to Section 6(c) hereof, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; provided that the indemnification contained in this paragraph shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder (or to the benefit of any person controlling such Holder) on account of any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any preliminary prospectus provided in each case the Company has performed its obligations under
Indemnification by the Company
 
Section 3(a) hereof if either (A) (i) such Holder failed to send or deliver a copy of the Prospectus with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale by such Holder to the person asserting the claim from which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise and (ii) the Prospectus would have corrected such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or such omission or alleged omission, or (B) (x) such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission is corrected in an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus and (y) having previously been furnished by or on behalf of the Company with copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, such Holder thereafter fails to deliver such Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale of a Registrable Security to the person asserting the claim from which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise.
 
(b)           .  Each Holder agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) or any other Holder, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Holder, but only (i) with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in such Registration Statement or Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) with respect to a failure to deliver the Prospectus as described in clause (A) or (B) of Section 6(a) hereof, provided the Company has provided such Prospectus to the Holder in accordance with this Agreement.  In no event shall the liability of any Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement giving rise to such indemnification obligation.
Indemnification by Holders
 
(c)           .  In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impeded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a), the Holders of a majority (with Holders of Notes deemed to be the Holders, for purposes of determining such majority, of the number of shares of Underlying Common Stock into which such Notes are or would be

convertible as of the date on which such designation is made) of the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement held by Holders that are indemnified parties pursuant to Section 6(a) and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b), the Company.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment to the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment (to the extent such settlement or judgment is subject to indemnification under Section 6(a) or 6(b) as the case may be).  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) before the date of such settlement, (A) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request (B) (1) reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request for the amount of such fees and expenses of counsel as the indemnifying party believes in good faith to be reasonable, and (2) provided written notice to the indemnified party that the indemnifying party disputes in good faith the reasonableness of the unpaid balance of such fees and expenses.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)           .  To the extent that the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or 6(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the initial placement pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (before deducting expenses) of the Registrable Securities to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate.  The relative benefits received by any Holder shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving Registrable Securities that are registered under the Securities Act.  The relative fault of the Holders on the one hand and the Company on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Holders or by the Company, and the parties' relative intent,
Contribution
 
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Holders' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6(d) are several in proportion to the respective number of Registrable Securities they have sold pursuant to a Registration Statement, and not joint.
 
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding this Section 6(d), no indemnifying party that is a selling Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities sold by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(e)           The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to an indemnified party at law or in equity, hereunder, under the Purchase Agreement or otherwise.
 
(f)            The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder, any person controlling any Holder or any affiliate of any Holder or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) the sale of any Registrable Securities by any Holder.
 
Section 7.               .  The Company covenants that, if at any time before the end of the Effectiveness Period the Company is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, it will cooperate with any Holder and take such further reasonable action as any Holder may reasonably request in writing (including, without limitation, making such reasonable representations as any such Holder may reasonably request), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and Rule 144A under the Securities Act and customarily taken in connection with sales pursuant to such exemptions.  Upon the written request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such filing requirements, unless such a statement has been included in the Company's most recent report filed pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of Exchange Act.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities (other than the Common Stock) under any section of the Exchange Act.

Miscellaneous
 
(a)           .  The Company is not, as of the date hereof, a party to, nor shall it, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that conflicts with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold by such Holders pursuant to such Registration Statement; provided that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, and provided further that no modification may change the provisions relating to the payment of Additional Interest without the consent of each Holder of Registrable Securities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, this Agreement may be amended by written agreement signed by the Company and the Initial Purchaser, without the consent of the Holders of Registrable Securities, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein, or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Agreement that shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Registrable Securities.  Each Holder of Registrable Securities outstanding at the time of any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent or thereafter shall be bound by any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent effected pursuant to this Section 8(b), whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent appears on the Registrable Securities or is delivered to such Holder.
