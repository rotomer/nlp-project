Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
 
In April 2002, Yahoo! Inc. adopted a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Program policy that permits certain corporate officers to establish "blind trusts" or prearranged trading plans to govern the sale of a specified number or dollar amount of shares of stock over a predetermined period of time.  Individuals may create these blind trusts when they do not possess material inside information.  Jerry Yang, co-founder and Chief Yahoo!, has established a Rule 10b5-1 compliant plan for the trading of Yahoo! stock.  Under the plan, Mr. Yang transferred three million shares of Yahoo! common stock to a "blind trust," which has complete discretion to trade the stock within a twelve-month period.  This plan was established in April 2003, during the current trading "window."
