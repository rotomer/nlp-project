INC.. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) 0-28018 (Commission File Number) DELAWARE 77-0398689 (State or other jurisdiction of (I.R.S. Employer Identification No.) incorporation or organization) 701 FIRST AVE.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. 99.1 Press release dated July 9, 2003 by Yahoo! Inc. Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition This Report on Form 8-K is being filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On July 9, 2003, Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Yahoo!"), announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003 and certain other information. A copy of Yahoo!'s press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The press release filed as an exhibit to this report includes "safe harbor" language pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, indicating that certain statements about the Company's business and other matters contained in the press release are "forward-looking" rather than "historic." The press release also states that a more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the Company's operating results is included, among other sections, under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's website (http://www.sec.gov), and will also be included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the third quarter of 2003. The press release, also discloses certain financial measures, such as operating income before depreciation and amortization, segment operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow, that may be considered non-GAAP financial measures in certain circumstances. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company believes that certain non-GAAP measures, including operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow are helpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures. Operating income before depreciation and amortization eliminates the effects of depreciation and amortization from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the business operations. Free cash flow is considered a liquidity measure and provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated after the acquisition of property and equipment, non-cash investment gains (losses), change in long-term deferred revenue and other, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. In addition, management refers to these financial measures to facilitate internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The non-GAAP measures included in our press release have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as is now required under new SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

We are optimistic about the future and we remain steadfastly focused on execution against our priorities." Business Outlook "This quarter's results demonstrate continued balanced growth across all of our revenue contributors and strong trends in our key financial metric of overall free cash flow generation. As we exit our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, we continue to execute upon the key business and financial objectives we have laid out as a company, resulting from a steadily increased base of hundreds of blue-chip traditional marketers, thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses, and millions of worldwide consumers. We are also upwardly revising our business outlook for revenues and operating income before depreciation and amortization for the full year 2003, and we are pleased that our own visibility in our financial prospects has increased," said Susan Decker, chief financial officer, Yahoo!. Please refer to the "Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" attached to this press release for our business outlook. Second Quarter 2003 Financial Highlights Revenues: In the second quarter of 2003, Yahoo! reported net revenues of $321.4 million, a 42 percent increase from the same period in 2002. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, net revenues were $604.4 million, a 44 percent increase from the $418.5 million reported in the same period in 2002. Marketing services revenues for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $219.2 million, a 44 percent increase from the same period in 2002. Marketing services revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $409.2 million, a 41 percent increase from the same period in 2002. These increases resulted from a combination of a strong increase in revenues from Yahoo!'s sponsored search services, as well as growth in the balance of Yahoo!'s global marketing services revenues. Fees revenues for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $69.9 million, a 43 percent increase compared to the same period in 2002. Fees revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $133.7 million, a 51 percent increase compared to the same period in 2002. These increases were primarily driven by the growth in paying relationships for Yahoo!'s premium services, including the SBC Yahoo! DSL and Dial products, Yahoo! Personals, and our small business and communications suites of premium services, partially offset by a decrease in our event webcasting business. Listings revenues for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $32.3 million, a 29 percent increase compared to the same period in 2002. Listings revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $61.5 million, a 52 percent increase compared to the same period in 2002. These increases were driven primarily by the incremental contribution of revenue from HotJobs, which was acquired in February 2002, as well as increases in our search and marketplace services revenues. Operating income and Operating income before depreciation and amortization: Operating income for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $62.8 million, compared to $7.5 million in the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $97.3 million, a 178 percent increase compared to the $35.0 million reported in the same period of 2002. Operating income margin was 20 percent of net revenues in the second quarter of 2003 compared to 3 percent of net revenues for the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization margin doubled to 30 percent of net revenues in the second quarter of 2003 compared to 15 percent of net revenues in the same period of 2002. The substantial increase in Operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization reflects strong growth in net revenues and only an 18 percent increase in costs on a year over year basis as a result of our ongoing cost discipline. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $117.7 million, compared to $3.3 million in the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $181.3 million, a 237 percent increase compared to the $53.8 million reported in the same period of 2002. Operating income margin was 19 percent of net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2003 compared to 1 percent of net revenues for the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization margin increased to 30 percent of net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2003 compared to 13 percent of net revenues in the same period of 2002. Cash flow from operating activities and Free cash flow: Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $92.1 million, compared to $103.4 million for the same period of 2002. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $67.7 million, a 6 percent increase compared to the $64.0 million reported for the same period of 2002. Cash flow from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $190.8 million, compared to $150.8 million for the same period of 2002. Free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $142.8 million, a 40 percent increase compared to the $102.3 million reported for the same period of 2002. Net Income (Loss): Net income for the second quarter of 2003 was $50.8 million or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with $21.4 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the same period of 2002. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $97.5 million or $0.16 per diluted share, compared with income before the cumulative effect of accounting change of $31.9 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the same period of 2002. Net loss was $32.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2002, including the charge of $64.1 million for the cumulative effect of the accounting change for the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 142, which the Company adopted January 1, 2002, requires companies to assess the goodwill recorded from previous acquisitions, and as necessary, record an impairment charge that does not affect cash or the Company's operations.

Other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2003 includes approximately $0.7 million of net losses, comprised of $1.6 million of net investment losses, $0.7 million of proceeds from the termination of a contract, and $0.2 million of net gains on disposal of assets. Other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2002 includes $4.9 million of net investment gains. Other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2002 includes $3.0 million of net investment gains and $2.5 million of proceeds from the termination of contracts. (2) Diluted net loss per share for the six months ended June 30, 2002 is computed excluding common share equivalents of 19,972 shares, as their effect is anti-dilutive. (3) The Company believes that certain non-GAAP measures, including operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow are helpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation and amortization. Operating income before depreciation and amortization eliminates the effects of depreciation and amortization from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the business operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, change in long-term deferred revenue and non-cash investment gains (losses) and other. Change in long- term deferred revenue represents cash payments received in advance of revenue recognized related to the Company's agreement with its sponsored search provider, which is expected to be recognized as marketing services revenue in 2005. Non-cash investment gains (losses) and other represents non-cash gains (losses) and impairment of investments. Free cash flow is considered a liquidity measure and provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated after the acquisition of property and equipment, non-cash investment gains (losses), change in long-term deferred revenue and other, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. In addition, management refers to these financial measures to facilitate internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, operating income, cash flows from operating activities, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
