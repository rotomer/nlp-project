INC. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) 0-28018 (Commission File Number) DELAWARE 77-0398689 (State or other jurisdiction of (I.R.S. Employer Identification No.) incorporation or organization) 701 FIRST AVE.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. 99.1 Press release dated October 8, 2003 by Yahoo! Inc. Item 12.Results of Operations and Financial Condition This Report on Form 8-K is being filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On October 8, 2003, Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Yahoo!"), announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003 and certain other information. A copy of Yahoo!'s press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The press release filed as an exhibit to this report includes "safe harbor" language pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, indicating that certain statements about the Company's business and other matters contained in the press release are "forward-looking" rather than "historic." The press release also states that a more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the Company's operating results is included, among other sections, under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's website (http://www.sec.gov), and will also be included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the fourth quarter of 2003. The press release also discloses certain financial measures, such as revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC"), operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow, that may be considered non-GAAP financial measures in certain circumstances. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We believe these financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, we have historically reported similar financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time. The Company believes that financial measures that may be considered non-GAAP in certain circumstances, including revenues excluding TAC, operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow are helpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures of gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities.
Revenues excluding TAC is defined as gross profit before other cost of revenues. We believe this measure is useful to management and investors as it is more comparable to our historical results, as traffic acquisition costs paid to affiliates of Overture Services, Inc., the Company's recently acquired wholly-owned subsidiary ("Overture"), are a significant percentage of revenues generated from Overture's sponsored search services. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation and amortization. We consider operating income before depreciation and amortization to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. This measure eliminates the effects of depreciation and amortization from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. A limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and change in long-term deferred revenue. Change in long-term deferred revenue represents cash payments received in advance of revenue recognized related to the Company's agreement with its sponsored search provider. Free cash flow is considered a liquidity measure and provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated after the acquisition of property and equipment and change in long-term deferred revenue, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. In addition, management refers to these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the Company's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income from operations, cash flow from operating activities, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The non-GAAP measures included in our press release have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as is now required under new SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Third Quarter 2003 Financial Highlights Revenues: In the third quarter of 2003, Yahoo! reported net revenues of $356.8 million, a 43 percent increase from the same period in 2002. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, net revenues were $961.2 million, a 44 percent increase from the $667.3 million reported in the same period in 2002. Marketing services revenues for the third quarter of 2003 totaled $245.1 million, a 48 percent increase from the same period in 2002. Marketing services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled $654.2 million, a 44 percent increase from the same period in 2002. These increases resulted from a combination of a strong increase in revenues from Yahoo!'s sponsored search services, and growth in the balance of Yahoo!'s global marketing services revenues. Fees revenues for the third quarter of 2003 totaled $79.4 million, a 38 percent increase compared to the same period in 2002. Fees revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled $213.0 million, a 46 percent increase compared to the same period in 2002. These increases were primarily driven by the growth in paying relationships for Yahoo!'s premium services, including the SBC Yahoo! DSL and Dial products, Yahoo! Personals, and our small business and communications suites of premium services, partially offset by a decrease in our event webcasting business. Listings revenues for the third quarter of 2003 totaled $32.4 million, a 26 percent increase compared to the same period in 2002. Listings revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled $93.9 million, a 42 percent increase compared to the same period in 2002. These increases were driven primarily by the incremental contribution of revenue from HotJobs, which was acquired in February 2002, as well as increases in our search and marketplace services revenues. Operating income and Operating income before depreciation and amortization: Operating income for the third quarter of 2003 totaled $83.5 million, compared to $29.5 million in the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of 2003 totaled $116.5 million, a 97 percent increase compared to the $59.2 million reported in the same period of 2002. Operating income margin was 23 percent of net revenues in the third quarter of 2003 compared to 12 percent of net revenues for the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization margin increased to 33 percent of net revenues in the third quarter of 2003 compared to 24 percent of net revenues in the same period of 2002. The substantial increase in operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization reflects strong growth in net revenues and only a 25 percent increase in costs on a year over year basis as a result of our ongoing cost discipline. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled $201.2 million, compared to $32.8 million in the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled $297.8 million, a 164 percent increase compared to the $113.0 million reported in the same period of 2002. Operating income margin was 21 percent of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 compared to 5 percent of net revenues for the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization margin increased to 31 percent of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 compared to 17 percent of net revenues in the same period of 2002. The increase in operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization reflects strong growth in net revenues and only a 20 percent increase in costs on a year over year basis. Cash flow from operating activities and Free cash flow: Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter of 2003 totaled $135.5 million, compared to $72.3 million for the same period of 2002. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2003 totaled $97.1 million, a 65 percent increase compared to the $59.0 million reported for the same period of 2002. Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled $326.3 million, compared to $223.1 million for the same period of 2002. Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled $246.6 million, a 56 percent increase compared to the $158.2 million reported for the same period of 2002. Net Income (Loss): Net income for the third quarter of 2003 was $65.3 million or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $28.9 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the same period of 2002. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $162.9 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared with income before the cumulative effect of accounting change of $60.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the same period of 2002. Net loss was $3.4 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, including the charge of $64.1 million for the cumulative effect of the accounting change for the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 142, which the Company adopted January 1, 2002, requires companies to assess the goodwill recorded from previous acquisitions, and as necessary, record an impairment charge that does not affect cash or the Company's operations.

Inc. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages) (1) Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2002 includes $0.7 million of net investment losses and $0.8 million of contract termination fees. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 includes $2.3 million of net investment gains and $1.7 million of net proceeds from the termination of contracts. There were no material comparative amounts for the three months ended September 30, 2003. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 includes approximately $1.6 million of net investment losses, $0.7 million of proceeds from the termination of a contract, and $0.2 million of net gains on disposal of assets. (2) Diluted net loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 is computed excluding common share equivalents of 16,779 shares, as their effect is anti-dilutive. (3) The Company believes that financial measures that may be considered non-GAAP in certain circumstances, including revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC"), operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow are helpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures of gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities. Revenues excluding TAC (referred to in our business outlook) is defined as gross profit before other cost of revenues. We believe this measure is useful to management and investors as it is more comparable to our historical results, as traffic acquisition costs paid to affiliates of Overture Services, Inc., the Company's recently acquired wholly-owned subsidiary ("Overture"), are a significant percentage of revenues generated from Overture's sponsored search services. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation and amortization. We consider operating income before depreciation and amortization to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. This measure eliminates the effects of depreciation and amortization from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. A limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and change in long-term deferred revenue. Change in long-term deferred revenue represents cash payments received in advance of revenue recognized related to the Company's agreement with its sponsored search provider. Free cash flow is considered a liquidity measure and provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated after the acquisition of property and equipment and change in long-term deferred revenue, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. In addition, management refers to these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the Company's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income from operations, cash flow from operating activities, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
