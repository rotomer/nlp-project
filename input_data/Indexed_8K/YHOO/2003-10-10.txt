Exhibit 99.6
 
 
 
SUNNYVALE, Calif. & PASADENA, Calif. Oct. 7, 2003Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading global Internet company, and Overture Services Inc. (Nasdaq:OVER), a global leader in commercial search services on the Internet, today announced the completion of Yahoo!'s acquisition of Overture. As a result of the merger, Overture is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo!.
 
"We are excited to combine the two companies to build the largest position in the rapidly growing Internet advertising market," said Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer, Yahoo! Inc. "We believe the combined companies will provide the most diverse set of integrated marketing solutions on the Web for small and large businesses, as well as extend our advertising capabilities across the Yahoo! network and around the globe."
 
Overture is the leading provider of commercial search with more than 100,000 advertisers globally. Overture's assets also include an extensive affiliate distribution network that both Yahoo! and Overture are dedicated to maintaining and enhancing. In addition, Overture has built a world-class technology infrastructure in commercial and Web search, as well as an extensive intellectual property portfolio.
 
The combination also furthers Yahoo!'s objective of becoming the leading end-to-end integrated search provider, combining assets capable of generating, distributing and monetizing search results. The two companies anticipate that they will be able to expand marketing opportunities on the Yahoo! network through the expansion of commercial search into vertical properties such as shopping, travel and yellow pages and integrating contextual advertising throughout Yahoo!'s network. In addition, Yahoo! will be able to leverage Overture's efficient, scalable marketplace by offering Overture's large base of advertisers additional Yahoo! services, and by expanding their combined products internationally.
 
"Through this combination, we believe Overture will be better positioned to deliver superior results to our users, marketers and distribution partners, and ultimately drive greater value for the combined companies and our shareholders," said Ted Meisel, president, Overture Services. "Overture pioneered commercial search, and we believe this is the right step to help us fully take advantage of the huge upside potential in the commercial search segment."
 
Overture's operations will remain in Pasadena following completion of the acquisition. Ted Meisel will continue to lead Overture's operations and will report to Dan Rosensweig, Yahoo!'s chief operating officer.
 
"The acquisition provides Yahoo! with outstanding and complementary personnel and technology to help Yahoo! become the most essential provider of Internet services for consumers and businesses," said Rosensweig. "We have undertaken an extensive integration planning process covering an array of functions and business units, resulting in a comprehensive integration plan that we intend to begin executing against immediately."
 
As a result of the merger, which was completed on October 7, 2003, each outstanding share of Overture common stock (other than shares for which appraisal rights are sought under Delaware law) has been converted into the right to receive 0.6108 of a share of Yahoo! common stock and $4.75 in cash.
