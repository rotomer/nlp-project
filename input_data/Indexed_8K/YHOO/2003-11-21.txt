YAHOO! HOLDINGS (HONG KONG) LIMITED ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO PURCHASE 3721 NETWORK SOFTWARE COMPANY LIMITED
 
Hong Kong, PRC  November 21, 2003 
Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited, part of the Yahoo! Inc. global Internet network, and
3721 Network Software Company Limited ("3721 NSC")
, a leading software development company, today announced the two companies have signed a definitive agreement under which Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited will purchase
3721 NSC
.  Under the terms of the agreement, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited has agreed to pay up to approximately US$120 million in cash over two years subject to certain conditions.
 
3721 NSC will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited.  There are no current plans to alter the management structure of either company.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.  It is expected the transaction will be completed in the first quarter of 2004.
 
"Together, Yahoo! and 3721 Network Software Company will bring together innovative technologies that can create a better experience for both users and businesses in Asia," said Allan Kwan, regional vice president and managing director for Yahoo! Inc., North Asia.  "The agreement provides outstanding and complementary personnel and technology to support and grow current Internet needs across China and Asia."
 
3721 NSC
is a software development company incorporated in Hong Kong.  3721 NSC has developed a range of leading and proprietary technologies that contribute to providing an enhanced user experience on the Internet.
 
As a further result of this purchase, Beijing 3721, a noted pioneer in selling keywords in China, through its technological cooperation with 3721 NSC and its affiliates, will have access to a broad range of Yahoo! technology, products and services.  Through this collaboration with Beijing 3721, the companies believe they will be able to help Asia's small- and medium-sized businesses reach an increasing number of consumers and build a bridge to global markets, while at the same time supporting the continued growth of Asia's software industry.
 
"Through this agreement, 3721 NSC gains the support of an entity that provides access to leading edge technologies, financial resources, world-class management, and the leverage of the most visited global Internet platform, all of which enhances our ability to further develop our existing technology portfolio," said Zhou Hongyi, chief executive officer, 3721 NSC.
 
Included in 3721 NSC's technology portfolio is its ability to enable keyword search through the Internet Explorer browser address bar in addition to other search tool bars.  In addition, 3721's double byte character technology enables non-English language based users to enter search terms in local languages.  3721 NSC's technology will complement Yahoo!'s already robust search services and enable Yahoo! to continue growing its global search strategy.
