Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. 99.1 Press release dated January 14, 2004 by Yahoo! Inc. Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition This Report on Form 8-K is being filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On January 14, 2004, Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Yahoo!"), announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 and certain other information. A copy of Yahoo!'s press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The press release filed as an exhibit to this report includes "safe harbor" language pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, indicating that certain statements about the Company's business and other matters contained in the press release are "forward-looking" rather than "historic." The press release also states that a more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the Company's operating results is included, among other sections, under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's website (http://www.sec.gov), and will also be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the first quarter of 2004. The press release also discloses certain financial measures, such as revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC"), operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We believe these financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, we have historically reported similar financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures revenues excluding TAC, operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow are helpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures of gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities. Revenues excluding TAC is defined as gross profit before other cost of revenues. We believe this performance measure is useful to management and investors as it is more comparable to our historical profitability, as traffic acquisition costs paid to affiliates of Overture Services, Inc., ("Overture"), which the Company acquired on October 7, 2003, are a significant percentage of revenues generated from Overture's sponsored search services. A limitation of revenues excluding TAC is that other cost of revenues are excluded and therefore does not represent the actual gross profit for the period.
Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation and amortization. We consider operating income before depreciation and amortization to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. This measure eliminates the effects of depreciation and amortization from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. A limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. In our business outlook, we define operating income before depreciation and amortization as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense. In our business outlook, this measure now also eliminates the effect of amortization of stock compensation expense from period to period as this expense is also not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. As a result, a further limitation associated with this measure is that it does not include all expenses related to our workforce. Management compensates for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock compensation expense on the face of our consolidated statements of operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and change in long-term deferred revenue, and includes Overture receivable settled through acquisition. Change in long-term deferred revenue represents cash payments received in advance of revenue recognized. Overture receivable settled through acquisition represents a Yahoo! accounts receivable balance from Overture that was settled as part of the acquisition. Free cash flow is considered a liquidity measure and provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated after the acquisition of property and equipment, change in long-term deferred revenue, and Overture receivable settled through acquisition, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. In addition, management refers to these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the Company's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income from operations, cash flow from operating activities, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The non-GAAP measures included in our press release have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as is required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Fourth Quarter and Year Ended 2003 Financial Highlights Cash flow from operating activities and Free cash flow: Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $101.9 million, compared to $79.4 million for the same period of 2002. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $92.3 million, a 47 percent increase over the $62.7 million reported for the same period of 2002. Free cash flow for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 included approximately $28.7 million of costs related to the acquisition of Overture, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2003. Cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $428.1 million, compared to $302.4 million for the same period of 2002. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $338.9 million, a 53 percent increase compared to the $220.9 million reported for the same period of 2002. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2003 included approximately $43.2 million of costs primarily related to the acquisitions of Overture and Inktomi, which closed during 2003. Cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities increased to $2,571.2 million at December 31, 2003, compared to $1,537.6 million at December 31, 2002. In addition to the free cash flow of $338.9 million generated for the year ended December 31, 2003, the company increased its cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities balances by $733.1 million related to issuance of convertible debt, and $353.2 million related to issuance of common stock from exercise of employee stock options, offset by approximately $370.4 million used for acquisitions completed in 2003, net of cash acquired. Revenues: In the fourth quarter of 2003, Yahoo! reported revenues of $663.9 million, a 132 percent increase from the same period in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, revenues were $1,625.1 million, a 71 percent increase from the $953.1 million reported in the same period in 2002. Marketing services revenue for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $545.5 million, a 178 percent increase from the $196.4 million reported in the same period in 2002. Marketing services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $1,199.7 million, an 84 percent increase from the $651.6 million reported in the same period in 2002. These increases resulted primarily from the strong increase in revenues from Yahoo!'s search and marketplace properties and growth in the balance of Yahoo!'s global marketing services revenues, as well as the incremental revenue associated with the acquisition of Overture in the fourth quarter of 2003. Fees revenue for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $85.2 million, a 37 percent increase compared to the $62.0 million reported in the same period in 2002. Fees revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $298.2 million, a 43 percent increase compared to the $207.9 million reported in the same period in 2002. These increases were primarily driven by the growth in paying relationships for Yahoo!'s premium services, including SBC Yahoo! DSL and Dial, small business and communications suites of premium services, and Yahoo! Personals, partially offset by a decrease in our event webcasting business. Listings revenue for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $33.2 million, a 21 percent increase compared to the $27.4 million reported in the same period in 2002. Listings revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $127.2 million, a 36 percent increase compared to the $93.6 million reported in the same period in 2002. These increases were driven by the increases in our search and marketplace services revenues as well as increased revenue from HotJobs, which was acquired in February 2002. Revenues excluding TAC and Gross profit: Revenues excluding TAC for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $511.3 million, a 79 percent increase compared to the $285.8 million in the same period of 2002. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $443.1 million, compared to $243.5 million in the same period of 2002. Revenues excluding TAC for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $1,472.5 million, a 55 percent increase compared to the $953.1 million in the same period of 2002. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $1,267.0 million, compared to $790.2 million in the same period of 2002. The increases in revenues excluding TAC for both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003, when compared to the same periods in 2002, resulted from the combination of a strong increase in revenues from Yahoo!'s search and marketplace properties and growth in the balance of Yahoo!'s global revenues. In addition, revenues excluding TAC for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 increased as a result of the incremental revenue associated with the acquisition of Overture. Operating income and Operating income before depreciation and amortization: Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $94.4 million, compared to $55.4 million in the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $157.5 million, an 86 percent increase compared to the $84.6 million reported in the same period of 2002. Operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization include stock compensation expense of $20.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Overture, compared to $0.7 million for the same period in 2002. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $295.7 million, compared to $88.2 million in the same period of 2002. Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $455.4 million, a 130 percent increase compared to the $197.6 million reported in the same period of 2002. Operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization include stock compensation expense of $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Overture, compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2002. The substantial increase in operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization both for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003, when compared to the same periods in 2002, reflects strong growth in revenues excluding TAC while maintaining ongoing cost discipline. Net Income: Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $75.0 million or $0.11 per diluted share, compared with $46.2 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the same period of 2002. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $237.9 million or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with income before the cumulative effect of accounting change of $106.9 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the same period of 2002. Net income was $42.8 million or $0.07 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2002, including the charge of $64.1 million for the cumulative effect of the accounting change for the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 142, which the Company adopted January 1, 2002, requires companies to assess the goodwill recorded from previous acquisitions, and as necessary, record an impairment charge that does not affect cash or the Company's operations.

Inc. Note to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC"), operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow are helpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures of gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities. Revenues excluding TAC is defined as gross profit before other cost of revenues. We believe this performance measure is useful to management and investors as it is more comparable to our historical profitability, as traffic acquisition costs paid to affiliates of Overture Services, Inc., ("Overture"), which the Company acquired on October 7, 2003, are a significant percentage of revenues generated from Overture's sponsored search services. A limitation of revenues excluding TAC is that other cost of revenues are excluded and therefore does not represent the actual gross profit for the period. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation and amortization. We consider operating income before depreciation and amortization to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. This measure eliminates the effects of depreciation and amortization from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. A limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. Operating income before depreciation and amortization includes stock compensation expense of $20.1 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating income before depreciation and amortization includes stock compensation expense of $22.0 million and $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In our business outlook, we define operating income before depreciation and amortization as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense. In our business outlook, this measure now also eliminates the effect of amortization of stock compensation expense from period to period as this expense is also not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. As a result, a further limitation associated with this measure is that it does not include all expenses related to our workforce. Management compensates for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock compensation expense on the face of our consolidated statements of operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and change in long-term deferred revenue and includes Overture receivable settled through acquisition. Change in long-term deferred revenue represents cash payments received in advance of revenue recognized. Overture receivable settled through acquisition represents a Yahoo! accounts receivable balance owed from Overture that was settled as part of the acquisition. Free cash flow is considered a liquidity measure and provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated after the acquisition of property and equipment, change in long-term deferred revenue and Overture receivable settled through acquisition, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. In addition, management refers to these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the Company's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated.
