Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. 99.1 Press release dated April 7, 2004 by Yahoo! Inc. Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition The information in this Current Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On April 7, 2004, Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Yahoo!"), announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004 and certain other information. A copy of Yahoo!'s press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The press release attached as an exhibit to this report includes "safe harbor" language pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, indicating that certain statements about the Company's business and other matters contained in the press release are "forward-looking" rather than "historic." The press release also states that a more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the Company's operating results is included, among other sections, under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's website (http://www.sec.gov), and will also be included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the second quarter of 2004. The press release also discloses certain financial measures, such as revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC"), operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We believe these financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, we have historically reported similar financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures revenues excluding TAC, operating income before depreciation and amortization and free cash flow are helpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures of gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities.
Revenues excluding TAC is defined as gross profit before other cost of revenues. We believe this performance measure is useful to management and investors as it is more comparable to our historical profitability, because traffic acquisition costs paid to affiliates of Overture Services, Inc., ("Overture"), which the Company acquired on October 7, 2003, are a significant percentage of revenues generated from Overture's sponsored search services. A limitation of revenues excluding TAC is that other cost of revenues are excluded and therefore it does not represent the actual gross profit for the period. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense. We consider operating income before depreciation and amortization to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. This measure eliminates the effects of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. A limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. A further limitation associated with this measure is that it does not include all expenses related to our workforce. Management compensates for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock compensation expense on the face of our consolidated statements of operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. In addition for the quarters ended June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2003, free cash flow also included change in long-term deferred revenue and Overture receivable settled through acquisition, respectively. Change in long-term deferred revenue represented cash payments received in advance of revenue recognized. Overture receivable settled through acquisition represented a Yahoo! accounts receivable balance owed from Overture that was settled as part of the acquisition. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. In addition, management refers to these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the Company's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget planning purposes, and in some cases to form the basis upon which management is compensated. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income from operations, cash flow from operating activities, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The non-GAAP measures included in our press release have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as is required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

YAHOO! INC. INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release dated April 7, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Yahoo! Reports First Quarter 2004 Financial Results Company Posts Revenues of $758 Million, Operating Income of $132 Million, Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization of $211 Million SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 7, 2004-- Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004. "Yahoo!'s performance surpassed even our high expectations, delivering the most successful quarter in the Company's history," said Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer, Yahoo!. "With our products more popular than ever before, we have experienced success across our entire business including strong growth in our fee-based and marketing services." -- Revenues were $758 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared to $283 million in the same period of 2003. -- Revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC") were $550 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared to $283 million for the same period of 2003. -- Gross profit for the first quarter of 2004 was $476 million, compared to $240 million for the same period of 2003. -- Operating income for the first quarter of 2004 was $132 million, compared to $55 million for the same period of 2003. -- Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the first quarter of 2004 was $211 million, compared to $85 million for the same period of 2003. -- Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter of 2004 was $236 million, compared to $99 million for the same period of 2003. -- Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2004 was $197 million, compared to $78 million for the same period of 2003. "Yahoo! is off to a great start in 2004. Our growth is a result of very impressive performance from our ongoing operations, leveraged further by recent acquisitions," said Susan Decker, chief financial officer, Yahoo!. "Looking forward, we are focused on making the appropriate investments and capital allocation decisions to help ensure sustainable, long-term growth. Due to our increased optimism about our business, we have raised our financial outlook for the full year 2004." First Quarter 2004 Financial Highlights Cash flow from operating activities and Free cash flow: Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $236 million, compared to $99 million for the same period of 2003. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $197 million, a 153 percent increase over the $78 million reported for the same period of 2003. Cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities increased by approximately $219 million to $2,790 million at March 31, 2004, compared to $2,571 million at December 31, 2003. In addition to the free cash flow of $197 million generated for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, the company increased its cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities balances by $92 million related to issuance of common stock from exercise of employee stock options and approximately $24 million related to other investing activities, offset by approximately $50 million used to enter into a structured stock repurchase transaction and approximately $44 million used for acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2004, net of cash acquired. The structured stock repurchase will mature in the third quarter of 2004, at which point depending on the price per share of Yahoo! shares, Yahoo! will either repurchase shares or receive the $50 million investment and a premium. Revenues: In the first quarter of 2004, Yahoo! reported revenues of $758 million, a 168 percent increase compared to the $283 million reported in the same period in 2003. Marketing services revenue for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $635 million, a 235 percent increase from the $190 million reported in the same period in 2003. This amount includes approximately $10 million related to a one-time gain from unredeemed third party loyalty program points that expired during the quarter. The year over year increase in marketing services revenue (excluding the gain related to the points expiration) resulted from a 48 percent growth in Yahoo!'s organic marketing services revenues, primarily in the search and marketplace properties, and incremental revenue associated with acquisitions completed during the past year. Fees revenue for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $88 million, a 39 percent increase compared to the $64 million reported in the same period in 2003. This increase was primarily driven by the growth in the number of paying relationships for Yahoo!'s premium services, which were approximately 5.8 million at March 31, 2004 compared to approximately 2.9 million at March 31, 2003. Listings revenue for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $34 million, a 16 percent increase compared to the $29 million reported in the same period in 2003. This increase was primarily driven by our search and marketplace listings. Revenues excluding TAC and Gross profit: Revenues excluding TAC for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $550 million, a 94 percent increase compared to the $283 million in the same period of 2003. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $476 million, compared to $240 million in the same period of 2003. The increase in revenues excluding TAC for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, when compared to the same period in 2003, resulted from the combination of a strong increase in revenues from Yahoo!'s organic marketing services revenues, as well as the incremental revenue associated with the acquisitions completed during the past year. Operating income and Operating income before depreciation and amortization: Operating income for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $132 million, compared to $55 million in the same period of 2003. Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $211 million, a 149 percent increase compared to the $85 million achieved in the same period of 2003. The increase in operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, when compared to the same period in 2003, reflects strong growth in revenues excluding TAC while maintaining ongoing cost discipline. Net Income: Net income for the first quarter of 2004 was $101 million or $0.14 per diluted share (which included $0.01 per diluted share related to the one-time gain from unredeemed third party loyalty program points that expired during the quarter), compared with $47 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the same period of 2003. Stock Split: Yahoo!'s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of all outstanding shares of the company's common stock, payable May 11, 2004 to stockholders of record on April 26, 2004. Please refer to the "Note to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" for definition of these key financial measures and "Business Outlook" attached to this press release.
