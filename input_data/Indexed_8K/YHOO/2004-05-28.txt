Individuals may create these blind trusts when they do not possess material inside information. Jerry Yang, co-founder and Chief Yahoo!, has established a Rule 10b5-1 compliant plan for the trading of Yahoo! stock. Under the plan, Mr. Yang transferred eight million shares of Yahoo! common stock to a "blind trust," which has complete discretion to trade the stock within a twelve-month period. This plan was established in May 25, 2004, during the current trading "window."
