Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. 99.1 Press release dated July 7, 2004 by Yahoo! Inc. Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition The information in this Current Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On July 7, 2004, Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Yahoo!"), announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 and certain other information. A copy of Yahoo!'s press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The press release attached as an exhibit to this report includes "safe harbor" language pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, indicating that certain statements about the Company's business and other matters contained in the press release are "forward-looking" rather than "historic." The press release also states that a more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect the Company's operating results is included, among other sections, under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's website (http://www.sec.gov), and will also be included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the third quarter of 2004. The press release also discloses the financial measures revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC"), operating income before depreciation and amortization, and free cash flow, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We believe these financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, we have historically reported similar financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures revenues excluding TAC, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and free cash flow are helpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures of gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities.
Revenues excluding TAC is defined as gross profit before other cost of revenues. Following our acquisition of Overture Services, Inc. ("Overture"), on October 7, 2003, our total costs of revenue include TAC paid to affiliates of Overture in connection with its sponsored search services. TAC also comprises a significant percentage of the revenues reported from Overture. We believe revenues excluding TAC is a useful measure to management and investors because it is more comparable to our historically reported profitability numbers. A limitation of revenues excluding TAC is that other cost of revenues are excluded and therefore it does not represent the actual gross profit for the period. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense. We consider operating income before depreciation and amortization to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. This measure eliminates the effects of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. A limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. A further limitation associated with this measure is that it does not include stock compensation expenses related to our workforce. Management compensates for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock compensation expense on the face of our consolidated statements of operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less net capital expenditures. In addition for the quarters ended June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2003, free cash flow also included change in long-term deferred revenue and Overture receivable settled through acquisition, respectively. Change in long-term deferred revenue represented cash payments received in advance of revenue recognized. Overture receivable settled through acquisition represented a Yahoo! accounts receivable balance owed from Overture that was settled as part of the acquisition. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. In addition, management refers to these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the Company's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget planning purposes, and in some cases as a factor in determining management compensation. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income from operations, cash flow from operating activities, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The non-GAAP measures included in our press release have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as is required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

YAHOO! INC. INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release dated July 7, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Yahoo! Reports Second Quarter 2004 Financial Results SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 7, 2004-- Company Posts Revenues of $832 Million, Operating Income of $149 Million, Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization of $234 Million Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. "Yahoo!'s second quarter results represent another record quarter for the Company and demonstrate continued execution of our core priorities," said Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer, Yahoo!. "Yahoo! is in the midst of a product renaissance, as we have been busier than ever rolling out new products and services we believe will be essential to our users." -- Revenues were $832 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $321 million for the same period of 2003. -- Revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC") were $609 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $321 million for the same period of 2003. -- Gross profit for the second quarter of 2004 was $535 million, compared to $275 million for the same period of 2003. -- Operating income for the second quarter of 2004 was $149 million, compared to $63 million for the same period of 2003. -- Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of 2004 was $234 million, compared to $98 million for the same period of 2003. -- Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2004 was $250 million, compared to $92 million for the same period of 2003. -- Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2004 was $194 million, compared to $71 million for the same period of 2003. "Yahoo! is benefiting from its diverse and balanced sources of revenue, which have well positioned the Company to deliver strong, consistent, and profitable growth," said Susan Decker, chief financial officer, Yahoo!. "Yahoo! remains committed to making the appropriate investments in our products and services in order to ensure that they remain among the most popular on the Internet, and continue to contribute to the creation of long-term shareholder value." Second Quarter 2004 Financial Highlights Cash flow from operating activities and Free cash flow: Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $250 million, compared to $92 million for the same period of 2003. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $194 million, a 172 percent increase over the $71 million reported for the same period of 2003. Cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities were approximately $2,650 million at June 30, 2004, compared to $2,790 million at March 31, 2004. The net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities balances is primarily a result of $530 million used for acquisitions completed in the second quarter of 2004, net of cash acquired, offset by free cash flow of $194 million and $225 million of cash generated from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of employee stock options for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Revenues: In the second quarter of 2004, Yahoo! reported revenues of $832 million, a 159 percent increase compared to the $321 million reported in the same period in 2003. Marketing services revenue for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $691 million, a 215 percent increase from the $219 million reported in the same period in 2003. The year over year increase in marketing services revenue resulted from strong growth in Yahoo!'s organic marketing services revenues, primarily in the search and marketplace properties, and incremental revenue associated with acquisitions completed during the past year. Fees revenue for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $104 million, a 49 percent increase compared to the $70 million reported in the same period in 2003. This increase was primarily driven by the growth in the number of paying relationships for Yahoo!'s premium services, which were approximately 6.4 million at June 30, 2004 compared to approximately 3.5 million at June 30, 2003. Listings revenue for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $38 million, a 17 percent increase compared to the $32 million reported in the same period in 2003. This increase was primarily driven by our search and marketplace listings. Revenues excluding TAC and Gross profit: Revenues excluding TAC for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $609 million, a 90 percent increase compared to the $321 million in the same period of 2003. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $535 million, compared to $275 million in the same period of 2003. The increase in revenues excluding TAC for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, when compared to the same period in 2003, resulted from the combination of a strong increase in revenues from Yahoo!'s organic marketing services revenues, as well as the incremental revenue associated with the acquisitions completed during the past year. Operating income and Operating income before depreciation and amortization: Operating income for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $149 million, compared to $63 million in the same period of 2003. Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $234 million, a 138 percent increase compared to the $98 million achieved in the same period of 2003. The increase in operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, when compared to the same period in 2003, reflects strong growth in revenues excluding TAC while maintaining ongoing cost discipline. Net Income: Net income for the second quarter of 2004 was $113 million or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with $51 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the same period of 2003. Please refer to the "Note to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" for definition of these key financial measures and "Business Outlook" attached to this press release.
