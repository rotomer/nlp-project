Exhibit 99.1 Yahoo! Reports Third Quarter 2004 Financial Results SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 12, 2004-- Company Posts Revenues of $907 Million, Operating Income of $172 Million, Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization of $260 Million Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004. "Yahoo! began to demonstrate the next stage in the Company's evolution in the third quarter, and in doing so recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue," said Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer, Yahoo!. "We accelerated the pace at which new products and services were developed, which in-turn helped increase the level of user engagement across the Yahoo! network. Our engaged audience enables us to deliver an unmatched set of advertising opportunities, providing deeper value to our marketers, and supporting the mantra that great products are the key to a great business." -- Revenues were $907 million for the third quarter of 2004, a 154 percent increase compared to $357 million for the same period of 2003. -- Revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC") were $655 million for the third quarter of 2004, an 84 percent increase compared to the $357 million for the same period of 2003. -- Gross profit for the third quarter of 2004 was $574 million, an 86 percent increase compared to $310 million for the same period of 2003. -- Operating income for the third quarter of 2004 was $172 million, an increase of 106 percent compared to $83 million for the same period of 2003. -- Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of 2004 was $260 million, a 122 percent increase compared to $117 million for the same period of 2003. -- Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter of 2004 was $267 million, an increase of 97 percent compared to $136 million for the same period of 2003. -- Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2004 was $202 million, a 108 percent increase over the $97 million reported for the same period of 2003. -- Net income for the third quarter of 2004 was $253 million or $0.17 per diluted share (including a net impact of $129 million, or $0.09 per share, related to the sale of an investment and the associated tax benefit resulting from fully reserved capital losses becoming realizable). Excluding this gain, net income for the third quarter was $124 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. This compares with net income of $65 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the same period of 2003. -- The provision for income taxes of $67 million yielded an effective tax rate of 21% for the third quarter of 2004 as a result of the previously described tax benefit associated with the capital loss carryforwards. The provision for income taxes in the same period of 2003 was $40 million, and yielded an effective tax rate of 38%. "Yahoo! generated its highest-ever level of free cash flow in the third quarter, more than doubling the amount generated one year ago," said Susan Decker, chief financial officer, Yahoo!. "We believe that long-term free cash flow generation is the most important factor driving shareholder value and we are very pleased with both its magnitude in this quarter and the strong foundation on which it is based, positioning us well for sustained growth." Third Quarter 2004 Financial Highlights Marketing services revenue for the third quarter of 2004 totaled $765 million, a 212 percent increase from the $245 million reported in the same period in 2003. Listings revenue for the third quarter of 2004 totaled $37 million, a 15 percent increase compared to the $32 million reported in the same period in 2003. The year over year increases in marketing services and listings revenues resulted from growth in Yahoo!'s organic revenue and incremental revenue associated with acquisitions completed during the past year. Fees revenue for the third quarter of 2004 totaled $104 million, a 31 percent increase compared to the $79 million reported in the same period in 2003. The year over year increase in fees revenues was primarily driven by the growth in the number of paying relationships for Yahoo!'s premium services, which were approximately 7.6 million at September 30, 2004 compared to approximately 4.2 million at September 30, 2003. United States revenues in the third quarter of 2004 were $655 million, an increase of $355 million, or 118 percent, compared to the same period in 2003. International revenues in the third quarter of 2004 were $252 million, an increase of $195 million, or 341 percent, compared to the same period in 2003. United States segment operating income before depreciation and amortization in the third quarter of 2004 was $223 million, an increase of $117 million, or 109 percent, compared to the same period of 2003. International segment operating income before depreciation and amortization in the third quarter of 2004 was $36 million, an increase of $26 million, or 251 percent, compared to the same period in 2003. These increases were primarily a result of the increase in US and International revenues and continued efforts to control discretionary spending during the period. Free cash flow was $202 million in the third quarter of 2004 and was the largest contributor to the increase of $425 million in our cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities grew from approximately $2,646 million at June 30, 2004 to $3,072 million at September 30, 2004. Together with free cash flow, this increase is a result of $106 million of cash generated from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of employee stock options and $191 million in net proceeds from the sale of an investment, offset by a net $46 million used in structured stock repurchase transactions and $28 million used for other investing activities, including acquisitions. Please refer to the "Note to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations" for definition of these key financial measures and "Business Outlook" attached to this press release.

Inc. Note to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and free cash flow, which are reconciled to gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities, respectively, which we believe are the most comparable GAAP measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs or TAC is defined as gross profit plus other cost of revenues. Under GAAP, both our revenues and cost of revenues include TAC. In defining revenues excluding TAC as our gross profit measure, we have removed TAC from both revenues and cost of revenues. We began incurring TAC when we acquired Overture Services, Inc. in October 2003. TAC represents revenues, a significant portion of which is shared with, and paid to, Overture's third party affiliates who integrate Overture's pay-for-performance search service into their websites. We present revenues excluding TAC: (1) to permit investors to make a meaningful comparison of our current performance to our performance before we acquired Overture, (2) to provide a metric for our investors to analyze and value our Company and (3) to provide investors one of the primary metrics used by the Company for evaluation and decision-making purposes. Specifically, it allows investors to compare gross profit as a percentage of revenues before and after the Overture acquisition, since TAC is the only significant difference in the cost of revenues between our legacy business and Overture's business. Consequently, presenting revenues excluding TAC helps investors better understand changes in our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for pre- and post-acquisition of Overture. We also provide revenues excluding TAC because we believe it is useful to investors in valuing our Company. One of the ways investors value companies is to apply a multiple to revenues. Since a significant portion of the GAAP revenues associated with Overture is paid to our third party affiliates, we believe investors find it more meaningful to apply multiples to revenues excluding TAC to assess our value as this avoids "double counting" revenues that are paid to, and being reported by, our third party affiliates. Further, management uses revenues excluding TAC for evaluating the performance of our business, making operating decisions, for budgeting purposes, and as a factor in determining management compensation. A limitation of revenues excluding TAC is that it is a measure which we have defined for internal and investor purposes that may be unique to the Company and therefore it may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry who have similar business arrangements but address the impact of TAC differently. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income from operations before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense. We consider operating income before depreciation and amortization to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. This measure eliminates the effects of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company, as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. A limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. A further limitation associated with this measure is that it does not include stock compensation expenses related to our workforce. Management compensates for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock compensation expense on the face of our consolidated statements of operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less net capital expenditures. In addition, for the quarters ended June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2003, free cash flow also included a change in long-term deferred revenue and an Overture receivable settled through acquisition, respectively. The change in long-term deferred revenue represented cash payments received in advance of revenue recognized. The Overture receivable settled through acquisition represented a Yahoo! accounts receivable balance owed from Overture that was settled as part of the acquisition. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Yahoo! Inc.
