Exhibit 99.1 Yahoo! Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2004 Financial Results SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 18, 2005-- Company Posts Full Year Revenues of $3,575 Million, Operating Income of $689 Million, Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization of $1,032 Million Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004. "Yahoo! moved at an impressive pace in the fourth quarter, capping another record year for the Company. Our users were more engaged in 2004 than ever before because of Yahoo!'s relentless focus on delivering the most innovative products and services on the Internet," said Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer, Yahoo!. "Yahoo! also benefited from the growing acceptance of online advertising with marketers who recognize its effectiveness and are therefore increasingly using this platform to reach their consumers." -- Revenues were $1,078 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, a 62 percent increase compared to $664 million for the same period of 2003. -- Revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC") were $785 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, a 54 percent increase compared to $511 million for the same period of 2003. -- Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $691 million, a 56 percent increase compared to $443 million for the same period of 2003. -- Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $235 million, a 149 percent increase compared to $94 million for the same period of 2003. -- Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $327 million, an 84 percent increase compared to $178 million for the same period of 2003. -- Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $337 million, a 231 percent increase compared to $102 million for the same period of 2003. -- Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $251 million, a 172 percent increase compared to $92 million for the same period of 2003. -- Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $373 million or $0.25 per diluted share (including a net impact of $185 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, related to the sale of an investment). Excluding this gain, net income for the fourth quarter was $187 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. This compares with net income of $75 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the same period of 2003. "Yahoo!'s strong fourth quarter performance completes our third consecutive year of delivering strong organic revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and generating substantial free cash flow," said Susan Decker, chief financial officer, Yahoo!. "We are attracting more and more users to Yahoo!'s network of services and driving their usage deeper with more relevant products and services. This deeper usage is the real magic behind the surpassing of our financial objectives." -- Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $3,575 million, a 120 percent increase compared to $1,625 million for 2003. -- Revenues excluding TAC for 2004 were $2,600 million, a 77 percent increase compared to $1,473 million for 2003. -- Gross profit for 2004 was $2,276 million, an 80 percent increase compared to $1,267 million for 2003. -- Operating income for 2004 was $689 million, a 133 percent increase compared to $296 million for 2003. -- Operating income before depreciation and amortization for 2004 was $1,032 million, a 116 percent increase compared to $477 million for 2003. -- Cash flow from operating activities for 2004 was $1,090 million, a 155 percent increase compared to $428 million for 2003. -- Free cash flow for 2004 was $844 million, a 149 percent increase compared to $339 million for 2003. -- Net income for 2004 was $840 million or $0.58 per diluted share (including a net impact of $314 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, related to the sale of an investment and the associated tax benefit resulting from fully reserved capital losses becoming realizable). Excluding this gain, net income for 2004 was $526 million, or $0.36 per diluted share. This compares with net income of $238 million or $0.18 per diluted share for 2003. -- The provision for income taxes of $438 million yielded an effective tax rate of 37% for 2004 as a result of the previously described tax benefit associated with the capital loss carryforwards. The provision for income taxes for 2003 was $147 million, and yielded an effective tax rate of 43%. Fourth Quarter and Year Ended 2004 Financial Highlights Marketing services revenue for the fourth quarter of 2004 totaled $911 million, a 67 percent increase from the $545 million reported for the same period of 2003. Marketing services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $3,002 million, a 150 percent increase from the $1,200 million reported for 2003. Listings revenue for the fourth quarter of 2004 totaled $38 million, a 15 percent increase compared to the $33 million reported for the same period of 2003. Listings revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $147 million, a 16 percent increase compared to the $127 million reported for 2003. The year over year increases in marketing services and listings revenues resulted from growth in Yahoo!'s organic revenue and incremental revenue associated with acquisitions completed during the past year. Fees revenue for the fourth quarter of 2004 totaled $129 million, a 52 percent increase compared to the $85 million reported for the same period of 2003. Fees revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $426 million, a 43 percent increase compared to the $298 million reported for 2003. The year over year increases in fees revenues were primarily driven by the growth in the number of paying relationships for Yahoo!'s premium services, which were approximately 8.4 million at December 31, 2004 compared to approximately 4.9 million at December 31, 2003. United States revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $775 million, a 42 percent increase from the $546 million reported for the same period of 2003. United States revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $2,653 million, a 96 percent increase from the $1,355 million reported for 2003. International revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $303 million, a 156 percent increase from the $118 million reported for the same period of 2003. International revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $921 million, a 241 percent increase from the $270 million reported for 2003. United States segment operating income before depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $278 million, a 68 percent increase from the $166 million reported for the same period of 2003. United States segment operating income before depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $891 million, a 102 percent increase from the $441 million reported for 2003. International segment operating income before depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $49 million, a 315 percent increase from the $12 million for the same period of 2003. International segment operating income before depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $141 million, a 291 percent increase from the $36 million reported for 2003. These increases were primarily a result of the increases in United States and International revenues and continued efforts to control discretionary spending. Free cash flow was $251 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $844 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Free cash flow was the largest contributor to the increase of $1,176 million in our cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities which grew from approximately $2,566 million at December 31, 2003 to $3,742 million at December 31, 2004. Other contributors to the increase were $651 million of cash generated from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of employee stock options, and $503 million in proceeds from sales of marketable equity securities, offset by a net $70 million used in structured stock repurchase transactions and $756 million used for acquisitions.

Earnings in equity interests and Minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries are now presented below Provision for income taxes. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, these items have consistently been presented net of income taxes. This presentation has also been adopted for prior periods. (3) In accordance with the adoption of EITF 04-08 "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share", the number of diluted shares for the three months and year ended December 31, 2003 has been revised to include the shares related to the Company's convertible notes since issuance. The inclusion of these shares results in a decrease of $0.01 to previously reported diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2003. There is no change to the previously reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2003. In addition, there is no change to the previously reported diluted earnings per share for any of the periods reported in the year ended December 31, 2004, as the computation of diluted earnings per share for all such periods included the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes as the market price condition for convertibility was satisfied in all periods reported. Yahoo! Inc. Note to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and free cash flow, which are reconciled to gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities, respectively, which we believe are the most comparable GAAP measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs or TAC is defined as gross profit plus other cost of revenues. Under GAAP, both our revenues and cost of revenues include TAC. In defining revenues excluding TAC as our non-GAAP gross profit measure, we have removed TAC from both revenues and cost of revenues. We began incurring TAC when we acquired Overture Services, Inc. in October 2003. TAC primarily represents revenues, a significant portion of which is shared with, and paid to, Overture's third party affiliates who integrate Overture's sponsored search service into their websites. We present revenues excluding TAC: (1) to permit investors to make a meaningful comparison of our current performance to our performance before we acquired Overture, (2) to provide a metric for our investors to analyze and value our Company and (3) to provide investors one of the primary metrics used by the Company for evaluation and decision-making purposes. Specifically, it allows investors to compare gross profit as a percentage of revenues before and after the Overture acquisition, since TAC is the only significant difference in the cost of revenues between our legacy business and Overture's business. Consequently, presenting revenues excluding TAC helps investors better understand changes in our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for pre- and post-acquisition of Overture. We also provide revenues excluding TAC because we believe it is useful to investors in valuing our Company. One of the ways investors value companies is to apply a multiple to revenues. Since a significant portion of the GAAP revenues associated with Overture is paid to our third party affiliates, we believe investors find it more meaningful to apply multiples to revenues excluding TAC to assess our value as this avoids "double counting" revenues that are paid to, and being reported by, our third party affiliates. Further, management uses revenues excluding TAC for evaluating the performance of our business, making operating decisions, for budgeting purposes, and as a factor in determining management compensation. A limitation of revenues excluding TAC is that it is a measure which we have defined for internal and investor purposes that may be unique to the Company and therefore it may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry who have similar business arrangements but address the impact of TAC differently. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income from operations before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense. We consider operating income before depreciation and amortization to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. This measure eliminates the effects of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company, as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. A limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. A further limitation associated with this measure is that it does not include stock compensation expenses related to our workforce. Management compensates for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock compensation expense on the face of the consolidated statements of operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less net capital expenditures. In addition, for the quarters ended June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2003, free cash flow also included a change in long-term deferred revenue and an Overture receivable settled through acquisition, respectively. The change in long-term deferred revenue represented cash payments received in advance of revenue recognized. The Overture receivable settled through acquisition represented a Yahoo! accounts receivable balance owed from Overture that was settled as part of the acquisition. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Yahoo! Inc.
