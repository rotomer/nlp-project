Exhibit 99.1 Yahoo! Reports Second Quarter 2005 Financial Results; Revenues - $1,253 Million, Operating Income - $261 Million, Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization - $368 Million SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2005--Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2005. "Yahoo! continued to see solid growth in the second quarter as a result of our strength in both search marketing and brand advertising, increased engagement from our large, global audience, and our ability to execute and perform according to plan," said Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer, Yahoo!. "We have a healthy business model that we believe will enable us to take advantage of future growth opportunities and we remain dedicated to providing our users with the very best services on the Internet." Consolidated Financial Results -- Revenues were $1,253 million for the second quarter of 2005, a 51 percent increase compared to $832 million for the same period of 2004. -- Marketing services revenue was $1,094 million for the second quarter of 2005, a 51 percent increase compared to $723 million for the same period of 2004. -- Fees revenue was $159 million for the second quarter of 2005, a 45 percent increase compared to $109 million for the same period of 2004. -- Revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs ("TAC") were $875 million for the second quarter of 2005, a 44 percent increase compared to $609 million for the same period of 2004. -- Gross profit for the second quarter of 2005 was $767 million, a 43 percent increase compared to $535 million for the same period of 2004. -- Operating income for the second quarter of 2005 was $261 million, a 75 percent increase compared to $149 million for the same period of 2004. -- Operating income before depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of 2005 was $368 million, a 57 percent increase compared to $234 million for the same period of 2004. -- Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2005 was $404 million, a 62 percent increase compared to $250 million for the same period of 2004. -- Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2005 was $300 million, a 55 percent increase compared to $194 million for the same period of 2004. -- Net income for the second quarter of 2005 was $755 million or $0.51 per diluted share (including net income of $563 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, related to the sale of an investment). This compares with net income of $113 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the same period of 2004. "We are very pleased with our second quarter results as they clearly underscore two fundamental business model strengths: excellent growth and great balance," said Susan Decker, chief financial officer, Yahoo!. "We see this as a terrific combination leading to the quarter's strong organic revenue growth, robust profitability, and substantial free cash flow."

Inc. Note to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and free cash flow, which are reconciled to gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities, respectively, which we believe are the most comparable GAAP measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing business outlook, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income from operations, and cash flow from operating activities calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs or TAC is defined as gross profit plus other cost of revenues. Under GAAP, both our revenues and cost of revenues include TAC. In defining revenues excluding TAC as our non-GAAP gross profit measure, we have removed TAC from both revenues and cost of revenues. TAC consists of payments made to affiliates that have integrated our sponsored search offerings into their websites and payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to the Yahoo! website. We present revenues excluding TAC: (1) to provide a metric for our investors to analyze and value our Company and (2) to provide investors one of the primary metrics used by the Company for evaluation and decision-making purposes. We provide revenues excluding TAC because we believe it is useful to investors in valuing our Company. One of the ways investors value companies is to apply a multiple to revenues. Since a significant portion of the GAAP revenues associated with our sponsored search offerings is paid to our third party affiliates, we believe investors find it more meaningful to apply multiples to revenues excluding TAC to assess our value as this avoids "double counting" revenues that are paid to, and being reported by, our third party affiliates. Further, management uses revenues excluding TAC for evaluating the performance of our business, making operating decisions, for budgeting purposes, and as a factor in determining management compensation. A limitation of revenues excluding TAC is that it is a measure which we have defined for internal and investor purposes that may be unique to the Company and therefore it may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry who have similar business arrangements but address the impact of TAC differently. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as income from operations before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense. We consider operating income before depreciation and amortization to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. This measure eliminates the effects of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense from period to period, which we believe is useful to management and investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company, as depreciation and amortization costs are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations. A limitation associated with this measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. A further limitation associated with this measure is that it does not include stock compensation expenses related to our workforce. Management compensates for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock compensation expense on the face of the consolidated statements of operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities including the tax benefit from stock options, less net capital expenditures and dividends received. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Yahoo! Inc.
