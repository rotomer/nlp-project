Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
                                            
 
of Directors of Yahoo! Inc. (the "Company") granted Terry Semel, the Company's Chief Executive Officer,  a stock option to purchase 1.3 million shares of the Company's common stock at a per share exercise price of $40.68.  The exercise price is the same exercise price at which the Company granted options to employees in December in connection with its annual employee review process.  The exercise price is approximately 33% higher than the closing trading price of the Company's Common Stock on the date the stock option was granted to him.  The stock option grant is in lieu of a cash bonus for Mr. Semel for 2005.  The stock option is fully vested, has a term of seven years and a post termination exercise period of three years (but in no event beyond the expiration of the term of the option).  Except as described above, the stock option is evidenced by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, a Stock Option Agreement in the form previously filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by the Company on May 25, 2005, and incorporated herein by reference.
On March 10, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
