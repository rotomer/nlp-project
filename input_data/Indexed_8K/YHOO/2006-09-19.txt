Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
As previously announced on September 6, 2006, members of the management of Yahoo! Inc. participated in the Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference (the "Goldman Conference") on Tuesday, September 19, 2006. At the conference Yahoo! communicated the following:
Over the last few weeks, we are starting to see some advertising weakness in some of the most economically sensitive categories.
         
This is having an impact on our expected Q3 results, leading us to believe we are likely to report results in the lower half of the business outlook ranges we provided in our earnings release on July 18, 2006 (furnished on a Current Report on Form 8-K on July 18, 2006).
         
It is too early to tell whether the advertising weakness is due to an economic issue or specific issues in advertisers' client businesses. Growth is still positive, but it is slower in Q3 than it was in the first half of the year.
