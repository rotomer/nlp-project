Semel, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in May 2006, Mr. Semel is eligible to receive a discretionary annual bonus for each of 2006 through 2008, payable in the form of a fully vested non-qualified stock option for up to one million shares of the Company's common stock with an exercise price equal to the closing trading price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. On February 26, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors granted Mr. Semel a fully vested non-qualified stock option for 800,000 shares of the Company's common stock as his annual bonus for 2006. The stock option has a per share exercise price of $32.12 (the closing trading price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant), a term of seven years and, subject to the earlier expiration of the stock option, a post termination exercise period of three years.
