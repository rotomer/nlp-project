Inc. Note to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income This press release and its attachments include the non-GAAP financial measures of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs or TAC, operating income before depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense, free cash flow and non-GAAP net income and non- GAAP net income per share, which are reconciled to gross profit, income from operations, cash flow from operating activities, and net income and net income per share, respectively, which we believe are the most comparable GAAP measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing our business outlook, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. We describe limitations specific to each non-GAAP financial measure below. Management generally compensates for limitations in the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying on comparable GAAP financial measures and providing investors with a reconciliation of the non- GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures. Further, management uses non-GAAP financial measures only in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income from operations, cash flow from operating activities, and net income and net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Revenues excluding TAC is defined as gross profit plus other cost of revenues. Under GAAP, both our revenues and cost of revenues include TAC. In defining revenues excluding TAC as our non-GAAP gross profit measure, we have removed TAC from both revenues and cost of revenues. TAC consists of payments made to affiliates that have integrated our sponsored search and/or display advertising offerings into their websites and payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to the Yahoo! website. We present revenues excluding TAC: (1) to provide a metric for our investors to analyze and value our Company and (2) to provide investors one of the primary metrics used by the Company for evaluation and decision-making purposes. We provide revenues excluding TAC because we believe it is useful to investors in valuing our Company. One of the ways investors value companies is to apply a multiple to revenues. Since a significant portion of the GAAP revenues associated with our sponsored search offerings is paid to our third party affiliates, we believe investors find it more meaningful to apply multiples to revenues excluding TAC to assess our value as this avoids "double counting" revenues that are paid to, and being reported by, our third party affiliates. Further, management uses revenues excluding TAC for evaluating the performance of our business, making operating decisions, budgeting purposes, and as a factor in determining management compensation. A limitation of revenues excluding TAC is that it is a measure which we have defined for internal and investor purposes that may be unique to the Company and therefore it may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry who have similar business arrangements but address the impact of TAC differently. Management compensates for these limitations by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures of revenues, cost of revenues and gross profit, each of which includes TAC. Operating income before depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense is defined as income from operations before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense (including the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, which currently consists almost entirely of stock- based compensation). We consider this measure to be an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company. We exclude depreciation and amortization because while tangible and intangible assets support our businesses, we do not believe the related depreciation and amortization costs are directly attributable to the operating performance of our business. This measure is used by some investors when assessing the performance of our Company. In addition, because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, we believe excluding stock-based compensation enhances the ability of management and investors to understand the impact of stock-based compensation expense on our operating income. We do not include depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense in our internal measures or in the measures used by the Company to formulate our business outlook presented with our quarterly financial information to investors. A limitation associated with the non-GAAP measure of operating income before depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. A further limitation associated with this measure is that it does not include stock-based compensation expense related to the Company's workforce. Management compensates for these limitations by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measure of income from operations, which includes depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities, less net capital expenditures and dividends received and including the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period. Non-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding certain gains, losses and expenses and their related tax effects that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating results and further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R") and therefore have now recorded stock-based compensation expense under the fair value method for all periods presented. As compared to prior periods' earnings releases, we have included only one non-GAAP measure for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share in this release, as this is our first earnings release in which all periods presented include stock-based compensation expense calculated in accordance with SFAS 123R. In our calculation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, we have excluded stock-based compensation expense and its related tax effects. We consider non- GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share to be profitability measures which facilitate the forecasting of our operating results for future periods and allow for the comparison of our results to historical periods. A limitation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share is that they do not include all items that impact our net income and net income per share for the period. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures of net income and net income per share, both of which include the expense and related tax effects of the item excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share.
