1995 Stock Plan
     The Board of Directors of Yahoo! Inc. (the "Company") previously adopted an amended and restated version of the Yahoo! Inc. 1995 Stock Plan (the "Restated 1995 Plan"). According to the preliminary results from the Company's annual stockholders meeting held on June 12, 2007, the Company's stockholders have approved the Restated 1995 Plan. Among other things, the Restated 1995 Plan reflects amendments to the plan to (i) increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock available for award grants under the Restated 1995 Plan by 50,000,000 shares (so that a maximum of 704,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued or delivered pursuant to awards granted under the plan); (ii) change the plan's share-counting provisions so that each share issued in respect of restricted stock and certain other "full-value" awards under the plan will count as 2.00 shares against the plan's share limits; (iii) eliminate certain minimum vesting requirements on restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted under the plan; and (iv) extend the Company's authority to grant awards under the plan intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code through the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders.
     A copy of the Restated 1995 Plan was previously filed as to the Company's proxy statement dated April 30, 2007 and is incorporated herein by reference.
