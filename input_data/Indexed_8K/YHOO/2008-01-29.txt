SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007.
We are executing aggressively against Yahoo!'s three big strategic priorities and that hard work is starting to bear fruit, as evidenced by the 20% year-over-year growth in O&O marketing services we achieved in the fourth quarter. This is a pivotal time for Yahoo!s business and we have a unique window of opportunity right now to make the necessary, game-changing investments that will help us capture a significant piece of the growing ad market and create substantial long-term value for our shareholders, said Jerry Yang, co-founder and chief executive officer, Yahoo! Inc. While we will continue to face headwinds this year, we believe that the moves we are making will help us exit 2008 stronger and more competitive and return to higher levels of operating cash flow growth in 2009.
