On February 12, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Yahoo! Inc. (the "Company") approved two change in control severance plans (the "Severance Plans") that, together, cover all full time employees of the Company, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the executive officers currently employed by the Company who were named in the Summary Compensation Table of the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (together, the "named executive officers"). The Severance Plans are designed to help retain the employees, help maintain a stable work environment and provide certain economic benefits to the employees in the event their employment is terminated in the circumstances described below.
The Severance Plans provide that if an eligible employee's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by the employee for "good reason" (as these terms are defined in the applicable Severance Plan) within two years after a change in control of the Company, the employee will generally be entitled to receive the following severance benefits:
The number of months used to calculate the severance benefit for each named executive officer is 24 months and the maximum outplacement benefit applicable to each named executive officer is $15,000.
Payment of the foregoing severance benefits is conditioned upon the employee's execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company and compliance with the employee's confidentiality, proprietary information and assignment of inventions obligations to the Company.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
