Yahoo! Reports First Quarter 2008 Financial Results
Revenues - $1,818 Million
Operating Income - $121 Million

SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008.
As outlined in our investor presentation, we believe we can significantly accelerate our revenue growth, return to our historically high margins, and double our operating cash flow by 2010. This quarters solid performance underscores the fact that we are executing on that plan. Yahoo! is beginning to realize the benefits of the very substantial and deliberate long-term investments weve made to capitalize on the opportunities ahead in display and to recapture momentum in search, said Jerry Yang, co-founder and chief executive officer, Yahoo! Inc.
Not only does Yahoo! have a unique franchise, it increasingly has industry-leading tools, technology and, most importantly, people. It is the hard work, dedication and professionalism of our people that is our greatest asset  and this quarters performance demonstrates how well they can perform under unusually challenging circumstances.

The heart of Yahoo!'s strategy to win is the simple proposition that if we are the starting point for the most users and provide the most comprehensive, easiest-to-use, must-buy platform for advertisers, we can drive the growth in volume and the improvement in yield we need to accelerate growth in revenues and operating cash flow. That, in turn, we believe will deliver attractive value to our stockholders, said Sue Decker, president, Yahoo! Inc. This past quarters financial results, important acquisitions, and, most importantly, the string of successful product rollouts demonstrate our enhanced execution against our longer-range goals. As we look forward, we are particularly excited by the potential capability of AMP! from Yahoo!, our revolutionary new ad management platform to help us further extend our lead in display advertising, which more than any other area of online advertising we believe has great potential for growth.
