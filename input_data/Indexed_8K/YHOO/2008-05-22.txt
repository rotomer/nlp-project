On May 5, 2008, Yahoo! Inc. ("Yahoo!" or the "Company") announced that its annual meeting had been called for July 3, 2008. On May 14, 2008, certain entities affiliated with Carl C. Icahn provided notice to the Company that they intend to nominate their own slate of ten (10) nominees for election as directors at the Company's 2008 annual meeting. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Company is now required to file its preliminary proxy materials at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the date that definitive copies of such materials are first mailed to stockholders.
The Company filed its preliminary proxy materials on May 22, 2008 and is postponing the Company's annual meeting until a date to be determined by the Board of Directors pending review and clearance of the Company's proxy materials by the SEC. The record date for the annual meeting has been set as the close of business on June 3, 2008. The date for the annual meeting is currently expected to be around the end of July 2008.
In light of the postponement of the Company's annual meeting, the deadline for the submission of stockholder proposals for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials relating to the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Rule 14a-8"), will be the close of business on June 3, 2008. To be eligible for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials, stockholder proposals must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 and with the Company's amended and restated bylaws.
The June 3 deadline applies only to stockholder proposals that are eligible for inclusion in the Company's 2008 annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with Rule 14a-8. The deadline for the submission of all other stockholder proposals, as well as stockholder nomination of director candidates, to be brought before the Company's 2008 annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of the Company's amended and restated bylaws has already expired.
