Yahoo! Reports Third Quarter 2008 Financial Results
Revenues - $1,786 Million
Operating Income - $70 Million
Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization, and Stock-Based Compensation Expense - $410 Million
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 21, 2008--Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008.
As economic conditions and on-line advertising softened in the third quarter, we remained highly focused on our 2008 strategy to invest in initiatives that enhance not only our long term competitiveness, but also our ability to deliver for users and advertisers even in this more difficult climate. We have been disciplined about balancing investments with cost management all year, and have now set in motion initiatives to reduce costs and enhance productivity, said Jerry Yang, co-founder and chief executive officer, Yahoo! Inc. The steps we are taking this quarter should deliver both near-term benefits to operating cash flow, and substantially enhance the nimbleness and flexibility with which we compete over the long term. We enter this slowing market with competitive advantages as the destination of choice for consumers and as a leader in providing online advertisers with the broadest set of advertising management tools and products in the industry. We plan to continue building on those strengths.

An increasingly challenging economic climate and softening advertising demand contributed to revenues this quarter coming in at the low end of our outlook range. While we are disappointed with our results, were pleased that we continue to benefit from the aggressive cost management efforts we have pursued during the year. These efforts helped our adjusted operating cash flow come in above the midpoint of our outlook range for the quarter, despite significant investments in our strategic objectives, said Blake Jorgensen, chief financial officer, Yahoo! Inc. We have the balance sheet strength, liquidity, and free cash flow we need to continue to make progress on our core strategies as we address this slowdown.
Cash Flow Information
In addition to free cash flow of $215 million for the third quarter of 2008, Yahoo! generated $14 million from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of employee stock options. This was offset by $29 million used for acquisitions and $16 million used to acquire intellectual property rights. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable debt securities were $3,299 million at September 30, 2008 as compared to $3,219 million at June 30, 2008, an increase of $80 million.
Cost Reduction Initiatives
During the third quarter, Yahoo! began implementing a series of cost reduction initiatives that contributed to the Company's adjusted operating cash flow exceeding the midpoint of its outlook for the quarter. The Company's goal is to reduce its current annualized cost run rate of approximately $3.9 billion by more than $400 million before the end of 2008. The Company anticipates that both headcount and non-headcount-related costs will be reduced by these actions. Because the majority of expenses are headcount-related, Yahoo! expects to reduce its global workforce by at least 10 percent during the fourth quarter of 2008.
Yahoo! also plans to implement additional cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving additional structural efficiencies over the next year. The Company anticipates these will result in substantial additional cost savings. The goal of these measures is to position Yahoo! for long-term, sustainable growth.
