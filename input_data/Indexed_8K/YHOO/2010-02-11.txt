The trust, which was established in April 2009, is scheduled to terminate by December 31, 2010. The blind trust is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Yahoo!'s Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan Policy.

Under the plan, Mr. Filo will sell up to two million shares of Yahoo! common stock in accordance with a prearranged trading schedule over a twelve-month period beginning in May 2010. The shares will be sold on the open market at prevailing market prices. This plan is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, and Yahoo!'s Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan policy.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
