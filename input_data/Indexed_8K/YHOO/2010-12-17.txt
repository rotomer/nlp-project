On December 13, 2010, Yahoo! Inc. (the "Company") began providing notices to employees whose employment will be terminated as part of a worldwide workforce reduction. The Company expects to incur severance and other related costs in conjunction with the worldwide workforce reduction. Total charges are expected to include cash costs as well as charges or credits related to stock-based compensation expense.
In connection with the worldwide workforce reduction, the Company expects to incur pre-tax cash charges of $33 million to $38 million for severance pay expenses and related cash expenditures. The estimated pre-tax cash charges are expected to be offset by a $4 million to $6 million credit related to stock-based compensation expense reversals. The Company expects to recognize the majority of the severance charges in the fourth quarter of 2010, with the remaining costs to be recognized in early 2011.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
