Yahoo! Reports Second Quarter 2011 Results
Earnings Per Share Increased 18% Year over Year with Income from Operations Increasing 9%
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2011--Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
Revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs (revenue ex-TAC) was $1,076 million for the second quarter of 2011, a 5 percent decrease from the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to the revenue share related to the Search Agreement with Microsoft. Excluding this item and other special items, revenue ex-TAC for the second quarter of 2011 increased 1 percent year over year. Special items include the impact of the divestiture of HotJobs, broadband deferred revenue amortization, and certain fee rate reductions.
GAAP revenue was $1,229 million for the second quarter of 2011, a 23 percent decrease from the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to the required change in revenue presentation related to the Search Agreement and the associated revenue share with Microsoft. Excluding the impact of these two items and the impact of the divestiture of HotJobs, broadband deferred revenue amortization, and certain fee rate reductions, revenue for the second quarter of 2011 decreased 9 percent compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Income from operations increased 9 percent to $191 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared to $175 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Net earnings per diluted share increased 18 percent to $0.18 in the second quarter of 2011, compared to $0.15 in the second quarter of 2010.
Financials at a Glance
"For the quarter, earnings per share was up by 18% year over year. We made clear progress in search, and saw strong growth in engagement on our media properties," said Carol Bartz, CEO of Yahoo!. "We experienced softness in display revenue in the second half of the quarter due to comprehensive changes we have made in our sales organization to position ourselves for more rapid display growth in the future."
Business Highlights
Yahoo! is home to nine #1 properties globally, and is in the top three in 23 categories. Yahoo! has nine out of the top ten original video programs on the Web.
Yahoo! continued to modernize its technology platforms, with 33 additional sites across the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific going live on the new global content platform in the quarter, bringing the total to 67. Yahoo! News in the U.S. went live in the quarter, the largest site to migrate to date.
Yahoo! continued to break its traffic records with news events including the Royal Wedding in April. Marking the largest one day event with more than 400 million page views, Yahoo! operated the Internets number one Royal Wedding site. People also turned to Yahoo! when news of the death of Osama bin Laden broke, with almost 900 million page views on Yahoo! News, 50 million video streams and 500 million photos viewed in the first week.
Yahoo! launched its new version of Mail offering a faster, safer and easier to use version of the #1 U.S. email.
Yahoo! introduced Yahoo! App Search for the PC and Yahoo! AppSpot, a free mobile app for iPhone and Android users, to help users discover new and relevant mobile apps. Using Yahoo!s powerful search technology, App Search and AppSpot allow users to zero-in on any app by showing matching app titles with a full comprehensive description, price, overall star rating from users, and screenshots in one spot.
Yahoo! and Benchmark Capital announced the formation of Hortonworks, an independent company consisting of key architects and core contributors to the open source Apache Hadoop technology pioneered by Yahoo!.
Yahoo! acquired IntoNow, enabling Yahoo! to provide enhanced media experiences and video programming, bolstering social engagement across the Yahoo! network and on all screens.
Yahoo! acquired 5to1, an online advertising alliance consisting exclusively of major media publishers. Built on a proprietary publisher-controlled platform, 5to1 offers top brand advertisers premium inventory at mass scale.
Yahoo! continued to introduce new original video programming including "In the Dressing Room" from Cat Deeley, the host of FOX Broadcasting Company's number one dance show "So You Think You Can Dance" and Trending Now, which quickly became the second most popular program on Yahoo! News.
Search Alliance Costs and Reimbursements
Yahoo!s results for the second quarter of 2011 reflect $55 million in search operating cost reimbursements and $12 million in transition cost reimbursements from Microsoft under the Search Agreement, which amounts are equal to the search operating costs and the transition costs incurred by Yahoo! in the second quarter. Transition cost reimbursements are subject to a $150 million cap, and through the second quarter aggregate transition costs of $146 million had been incurred. Search operating cost reimbursements are expected to continue to decline as Yahoo! fully transitions all markets to Microsofts search platform and the underlying expenses are no longer incurred under our cost structure. Our business outlook for total expenses reflects these anticipated savings. The net impact of the transition costs and transition cost reimbursements were neutral to total operating expenses in the second quarter, as expected.
Second Quarter 2011 Revenue Results
Display revenue ex-TAC increased 5 percent to $467 million, compared to $445 million for the second quarter of 2010.
GAAP display revenue increased 2 percent to $524 million, compared to $514 million for the second quarter of 2010.
Search revenue ex-TAC was $371 million, a 15 percent decrease compared to $438 million for the second quarter of 2010.
GAAP search revenue was $467 million, a 45 percent decrease compared to $842 million for the second quarter of 2010.
Cash Flow and Cash Balance
Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2011 was $331 million, a 5 percent decrease compared to $347 million for the same period of 2010.
Free cash flow was $96 million for the second quarter of 2011, a 25 percent decrease compared to $127 million for the same period of 2010.
Cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable debt securities were $3,255 million at June 30, 2011 compared to $3,629 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $374 million. During the second quarter of 2011, Yahoo! repurchased 30 million shares for $472 million.
Business Outlook
Revenue ex-TAC for the third quarter of 2011 is expected to be in the range of $1,050 million to $1,100 million. Based on the terms of the Search Agreement with Microsoft, Microsoft retains a revenue share of 12 percent of the net (after TAC) search revenue generated on Yahoo! Properties and Affiliate sites in transitioned markets. Yahoo! reports the net revenue it receives under the Search Agreement as revenue and no longer presents the associated TAC within cost of revenue. Accordingly, for transitioned markets Yahoo! reports GAAP revenue associated with the Search Agreement on a net (after TAC) basis rather than a gross basis. For markets that have not yet transitioned, revenue continues to be recorded on a gross basis, and TAC is recorded in cost of revenue. Microsofts revenue share in the third quarter of 2011 is expected to be approximately $35 million. GAAP revenue for the third quarter of 2011 is expected to be in the range of $1,200 million to $1,260 million. Total expenses (cost of revenue plus total operating expenses) for the third quarter of 2011 is expected to be in the range of $1,065 million to $1,095 million. Total expenses less TAC for the third quarter of 2011 is expected to be in the range of $915 million to $935 million. Income from operations for the third quarter of 2011 is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $165 million.
Business outlook for revenue ex-TAC is being provided to reflect the underlying dynamics of the business during the Microsoft transition and to facilitate comparisons to prior periods.

Note to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
This press release and its attachments include the non-GAAP financial measures of revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs (revenue ex-TAC), free cash flow, total expenses (GAAP cost of revenue plus GAAP total operating expenses) less TAC, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are reconciled to revenue, cash flow from operating activities, total expenses (GAAP cost of revenue plus GAAP total operating expenses), net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc., and net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. common stockholders per share - diluted, which we believe are the most comparable GAAP measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. We describe limitations specific to each non-GAAP financial measure below. Management generally compensates for limitations in the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying on comparable GAAP financial measures and providing investors with a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures. Further, management uses non-GAAP financial measures only in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business and operating costs. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, revenue, cash flow from operating activities, total expenses, net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc., and net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. common stockholders per share - diluted calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Revenue ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP revenue less TAC. TAC consists of payments made to third-party entities that have integrated our advertising offerings into their Websites or other offerings (those Websites and other offerings, Affiliate sites) and payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to Yahoo!s online properties and services (Yahoo! Properties). Based on the terms of the Search Agreement with Microsoft, Microsoft retains a revenue share of 12 percent of the net (after TAC) search revenue generated on Yahoo! Properties and Affiliate sites in transitioned markets. Yahoo! reports the net revenue it receives under the Search Agreement as revenue and no longer presents the associated TAC within cost of revenue. Accordingly, for transitioned markets Yahoo! reports GAAP revenue associated with the Search Agreement on a net (after TAC) basis rather than a gross basis. For markets that have not yet transitioned, revenue continues to be recorded on a gross basis, and TAC is recorded in cost of revenue. We present revenue ex-TAC to provide investors a metric used by the Company for evaluation and decision-making purposes during the Microsoft transition and to provide investors with comparable revenue numbers when comparing periods preceding, during and following the transition period. We present revenue ex-TAC business outlook to reflect the underlying dynamics of the business during the Microsoft transition and to facilitate comparisons to prior periods. A limitation of revenue ex-TAC is that it is a measure which we have defined for internal and investor purposes that may be unique to the Company, and therefore it may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry who have similar business arrangements but address the impact of TAC differently. Management compensates for these limitations by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures of revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit, each of which includes the impact of TAC.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash flow from operating activities (adjusted to include excess tax benefits from stock-based awards), less acquisition of property and equipment, net and dividends received from equity investees. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet, and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period.
Total expenses less TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total expenses (GAAP cost of revenue plus GAAP total operating expenses) less TAC. We consider total expenses less TAC to be a useful indicator of our operating costs. We exclude TAC from this measure because TAC generally varies based on the revenue we earn from traffic supplied by certain third parties, and doing so assists investors in understanding the operating cost structure of our business. A limitation associated with the non-GAAP measure of total expenses less TAC is that it does not reflect TAC. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures of cost of revenue and income from operations, each of which includes TAC.
Non-GAAP net income is defined as net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. excluding certain gains, losses, expenses, and their related tax effects that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing results. We consider non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be profitability measures which facilitate the forecasting of our results for future periods and allow for the comparison of our results to historical periods. A limitation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share is that they do not include all items that impact our net income and net income per diluted share for the period. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures of net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. and net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. common stockholders per share - diluted, both of which include the gains, losses, expenses and related tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share.
