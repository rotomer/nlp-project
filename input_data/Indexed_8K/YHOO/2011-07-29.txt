On July 29, 2011, Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Yahoo") entered into a Framework Agreement, by and among Yahoo, Alibaba Group Holding Limited, a company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("Alibaba"), Softbank Corp., a Japanese corporation ("Softbank"), Alipay.com Co., Ltd., a limited liability company organized under the laws of the People's Republic of China ("Alipay"), APN Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("IPCo"), Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce Co., Ltd., a limited liability company organized under the laws of the People's Republic of China ("HoldCo"), Jack Ma Yun, Joseph C. Tsai and certain security holders of Alipay or HoldCo as joinder parties.
Yahoo and Softbank are principal shareholders of Alibaba and Mr. Ma and Mr. Tsai are shareholders, directors and executive officers of Alibaba. Alipay, formerly a subsidiary of Alibaba, is a subsidiary of Holdco, which is majority owned by Mr. Ma. Alipay engages in the online payments business in the People's Republic of China ("PRC") and provides online payments services to Taobao and other subsidiaries of Alibaba, and third parties. IPCo is a special purpose entity formed in connection with the Framework Agreement which prior to the closing of the transactions will be owned by Mr. Ma and Mr. Tsai.
Pursuant to the terms of the Framework Agreement, the parties have agreed, among other things, that (1) upon the occurrence of certain liquidity events (including a public offering or sale of the company) with respect to Alipay, Alipay will pay a percentage of the proceeds of such liquidity event to Alibaba (the "Liquidity Event Payment"); (2) Alibaba (including Taobao Marketplace and Taobao Mall) will receive payment processing services on preferential terms from Alipay and its subsidiaries in accordance with a long-term commercial agreement (the "Commercial Agreement"); (3) Alibaba will license to Alipay certain intellectual property and perform various software technology services for Alipay in accordance with an intellectual property license and software technology services agreement (the "Intellectual Property and Software Technology Services Agreement"); (4) IPCo will issue to Alibaba a seven year maturity promissory note in the principal amount of $500 million (the "IPCo Promissory Note"); and (5) the IPCo Promissory Note, the Liquidity Event Payment and certain other payments will be secured by a pledge of 50,000,000 ordinary shares of Alibaba which will be contributed to IPCo by Mr. Ma and Mr. Tsai, as well as certain other collateral which may be pledged in the future; in each case as more fully described below.
Prior to the consummation of the transactions under the Framework Agreement (the "Closing"), Alibaba and its subsidiaries will undertake certain restructuring transactions set forth in the Framework Agreement to consolidate certain assets, liabilities and employees related to the Alipay business into specific subsidiaries which will be transferred to Alipay either at Closing or following a Liquidity Event. Further at Closing, a subsidiary of Alibaba that provides call center services for the Alipay business will be transferred to Alipay.
Liquidity Event
Pursuant to the terms of the Framework Agreement, a "Liquidity Event" will be deemed to occur upon the earlier of (1) a qualified initial public offering of Alipay; (2) a transfer of 37.5% or more of the securities of Alipay; or (3) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Alipay.
Upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event, HoldCo must pay to Alibaba 37.5% of the equity value of Alipay (the "Liquidity Event Payment"), less $500 million (i.e., the principal amount of the IPCo Promissory Note). The Liquidity Event Payment plus $500 million must in the aggregate not be less than $2 billion and may not exceed $6 billion, subject to certain increases and additional payments if no Liquidity Event has occurred by the sixth anniversary of Closing. The Liquidity Event Payment may be paid in installments over 24 months if the Liquidity Event does not generate sufficient proceeds to enable immediate payment of the Liquidity Event Payment.
 
At any time following the tenth anniversary of the Closing, if no Liquidity Event has yet occurred, Alibaba will have the right to cause HoldCo and HoldCo's shareholders to effect a Liquidity Event with respect to Alipay, provided that Alipay's equity value or enterprise value at such time exceeds $1 billion. In this case, the $2 billion minimum amount described above will not apply to a Liquidity Event effected by means of a qualified initial public offering, a sale of all of the securities of Alipay, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Alipay.
Make-Whole Payment
If a Liquidity Event results in a transfer of 37.5% or more (but less than 100%) of the securities of Alipay (a "First Event") and a subsequent liquidity event (including a HoldCo Liquidity Event as described below) occurs within three years (a "Later Event"), then HoldCo will pay to Alibaba a "Make-Whole Payment" equal to the excess, if any, of (1) 37.5% of the equity value of Alipay in the Later Event less $500 million (the amount of the IPCo Promissory Note), over (2) the Liquidity Event Payment from the First Event. Only one Later Event may trigger a Make-Whole Payment.
A "HoldCo Liquidity Event" will be deemed to occur upon (1) a public offering of securities of HoldCo; (2) a transfer of beneficial ownership of 37.5% or more of the securities of HoldCo; or (3) a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of HoldCo. Until the date that certain payments are paid in full, including the Liquidity Event Payment, Mr. Ma, Mr. Tsai, HoldCo and its shareholders will not effect or permit a HoldCo Liquidity Event.
Additional Pledge of Collateral for Later Payments
If a Liquidity Event or Later Event does not generate sufficient proceeds to enable immediate payment of the Liquidity Event Payment and the other amounts payable, Mr. Ma and Mr. Tsai shall pledge shares of Alibaba, cash and/or marketable securities with a value at least equal to the amount of the deferred payment obligations (the "Shortfall Amount").
Non-Compete Provisions
From the Closing of the Framework Agreement until the date when the Liquidity Event Payment and certain other payments have been paid in full, (1) Alibaba and its subsidiaries will not compete in the PRC with the business of Alipay, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) HoldCo, Alipay and their respective subsidiaries will not compete anywhere in the world with Alibaba or its subsidiaries' businesses, subject to certain exceptions.
IPCO Promissory Note and Related Security Documents
Under the terms of the IPCo Promissory Note, the "Maturity Date" will occur seven years following the Closing under the Framework Agreement or, if the Liquidity Event occurs prior to seven years following the Closing, the date that certain payments, including the Liquidity Event Payment, are required to be paid in full (in which case the IPCo Promissory Note may be paid in installments on the same schedule as the Liquidity Event Payment, or may be prepaid sooner). No interest shall accrue until the Maturity Date (or, if sooner, the date of the Liquidity Event). After the Maturity Date (or, if sooner, the date of the Liquidity Event), interest will accrue at the two-year U.S. treasury rate plus two percent. IPCo may prepay up to $475 million of the principal amount at any time and, with Alibaba's consent, the remaining principal amount, in each case without penalty or premium.
IPCo will secure any obligation of IPCo, Alipay, HoldCo, Mr. Ma and Mr. Tsai under the IPCo Promissory Note and related security documents (the "Secured Obligations") by pledging an aggregate of 50,000,000 ordinary shares of Alibaba. As continuing security for the Secured Obligations, Mr. Ma and Mr. Tsai will grant a security interest in all issued shares of IPCo legally and beneficially owned by each of Mr. Ma and Mr. Tsai.
 
Commercial Agreement
Under the Commercial Agreement, among Alibaba, Holdco and Alipay, Alipay agrees to provide payment processing services, to Alibaba and its subsidiaries (including Taobao Marketplace and Taobao Mall) on preferential terms. The fees to be paid by Alibaba and its subsidiaries to Alipay for the services provided under the Commercial Agreement will take into account Alibaba and its Subsidiaries' status as large volume customers and will be approved on an annual basis by the directors of Alibaba designated by Yahoo and Softbank. The Commercial Agreement will be non-exclusive and will remain in effect for an auto-renewing 50 year term, subject to Alibaba's right to terminate upon one year's prior written notice. If in connection with an initial public offering of Alipay, the Commercial Agreement is required by applicable regulatory authorities to be modified, a one-time payment may be payable by Holdco to Alibaba to compensate Alibaba the overall impact of such adjustment. The Commercial Agreement will become effective upon the Closing.
Intellectual Property License and Software Technology Services Agreement
Under the Intellectual Property License and Software Technology Services Agreement, among Alibaba and Alipay, Alibaba licenses to Alipay certain intellectual property and technology and provide certain software technology services to Alipay and its subsidiaries. Alipay will pay to Alibaba (1) a royalty equal to a certain percentage of the consolidated revenue of Alipay and its subsidiaries and (2) a software technology services fee. The royalty and the software technology services fee consist of an expense reimbursement and a 49.9% share of the consolidated pre-tax income of Alipay and its subsidiaries. This percentage will decrease upon certain dilutive equity issuances by Alipay and HoldCo; provided, however, such percentage shall not be reduced below 30%. The Intellectual Property License and Software Technology Services Agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) such time as it may be required to be terminated by applicable regulatory authorities in connection with a qualified initial public offering and (ii) the date the Liquidity Event Payment, the IPCo Promissory Note and certain related payments have been paid in full. The Intellectual Property License and Software Technology Services Agreement will become effective upon the Closing.
Release Agreement
Upon the Closing of the Framework Agreement, Yahoo, Softbank, Alibaba, Holdco, Mr. Ma, Mr. Tsai will enter into an agreement (the "Release Agreement") (1) pursuant to which the parties agree that the Alibaba board of directors will ratify the actions taken by Alibaba in connection with the restructuring of the ownership of Alipay and the termination of certain control agreements which resulted in the deconsolidation of Alipay; and (2) releasing claims against Alibaba, Alipay, HoldCo, Mr. Ma, Mr. Tsai and certain of their related parties (including Alibaba's directors in their capacity as such) from any and all claims and liabilities, subject to certain limitations, arising out of or based upon such actions.
Conditions to Closing
The parties' obligations to consummate the transactions under the Framework Agreement are subject to certain closing conditions, including obtaining PRC regulatory approval. The parties expect this approval to be obtained by the end of 2011.
Termination Provisions
The Framework Agreement contains certain termination rights, including, among other things, that at any time prior to the Closing, the Framework Agreement may be terminated as follows: (1) upon unanimous written agreement of all parties; (2) by either Alibaba or Holdco (i) if a governmental authority permanently enjoins or prohibits the transactions, (ii) if the PBOC issues an order withdrawing the PBOC payment license issued to Alipay or prohibits (or narrows the scope of) Alipay's business as approved under the PBOC payment license, or (iii) if certain PRC approvals are not obtained and such
 
failure is final and non-appealable; (3) by Alibaba (i) if HoldCo, Alipay, IPCo, Mr. Ma or Mr. Tsai breach certain of its representations or warranties, covenants or agreements with a 20-day cure period; (4) by HoldCo if Alibaba, Yahoo or Softbank breach certain representations or warranties, covenants or agreements with a 20-day cure period; or (5) by any party if the closing has not occurred before December 31, 2011, as long as the terminating party's breach is not the primary cause of the failure of the closing conditions to be satisfied. The December 31, 2011 is subject to an automatic extension by up to 60 days if required PRC regulatory approvals are the only remaining unsatisfied condition.

Exhibit 99.1
HONG KONG, TOKYO AND SUNNYVALE, Calif, JULY 29, 2011  Alibaba Group, Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO), and SoftBank (TYO: JP:9984) today announced they have reached an agreement in which Alibaba Group will continue to participate in Alipay's future financial performance, including a future IPO or other liquidity event. The agreement is consistent with the two agreed-upon principles established at the outset of the negotiations: structure the inter-company relationship between Alipay and Taobao in order to preserve the value within Taobao and, by extension, within Alibaba Group; and provide that Alibaba Group is appropriately compensated for the value of Alipay.
Key Terms of the Agreement:
The agreement establishes the following:
 
 
 
"Over the last few months, we have worked cooperatively with our partners at Yahoo! and SoftBank to reach an agreement that serves the interests of all parties," said Jack Ma, Alibaba Group CEO. "This agreement is good for Alibaba Group and its stakeholders, including customers, employees and shareholders. Most importantly, Alipay was able to secure the license it needed to continue operating."
"This is a good outcome for Yahoo! and for our shareholders, as well as all the parties to this agreement," said Carol Bartz, Yahoo! CEO. "As a result of this constructive process, we have an agreement that preserves the value of Taobao, provides for profit sharing at Alipay, and creates a structure to allow Alibaba Group to participate if Alipay's value is realized in an IPO or other
 
liquidity event. Alibaba Group and its management team have an impressive track record of value creation and we look forward to participating in Alibaba Group'sand Alipay'scontinued success."
"This agreement was in part made possible by the strong long-term relationship and trust that exists between the principals at Alibaba Group, SoftBank and Yahoo!, and also lays the foundation for Alibaba Group to continue its impressive growth under the dynamic leadership of Jack Ma," said Masayoshi Son, SoftBank CEO. "Alibaba Group is a clear leader in the China Internet business, the largest and fastest growing market in the world, and the close relationship with Alipay will allow Alibaba Group to strengthen that leadership position in the years to come."
Alipay provides payment processing services to Alibaba Group and some affiliates, including Taobao, and to third parties. Taobao is China's largest online retail website. Alibaba Group's principal shareholders include Yahoo!, SoftBank, and Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai. In May 2011, Alipay obtained a license to operate in China from the People's Republic Bank of China following the restructuring of Alipay. The license will enable Alipay to continue serving Taobao and its other customers in China.
Regulatory Approvals
The agreement is expected to close by the end of 2011 and is subject to certain regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.
Conference Call
Alibaba Group, Yahoo! and SoftBank will discuss this agreement on a conference call at 8:45 a.m. ET/5:45 a.m. PT today. A live Webcast of the conference call can be accessed through Yahoo!'s Investor Relations Website at . In addition, an archive of the Webcast can be accessed through the same link. An audio replay of the call will be available for two weeks following the conference call by calling 1-888-286-8010 for US callers or +1-617-801-6888 for international callers, reservation number: 62557239.
