In order to render this opinion, we have examined copies of the contracts and agreements set out in the hereto (collectively, the ""), certificates issued by the officer of Holdco and other documents we considered appropriate (collectively, the "").
Schedule I
Transaction Documents
Documents
In our examination of these Documents, we have assumed, with your consent, that (a) all Documents submitted to us as copies conform to their originals and all Documents submitted to us as originals are authentic; (b) all signatures, seals and chops on such Documents are genuine; (c) other than the PRC Parties, all parties have the requisite power and authority to enter into the Documents and each of the Documents has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by the relevant parties; (d) all factual information stated or given in such Documents is true and correct; (e) each of the Documents provided to us has not been revoked, amended, varied or supplemented in any manner; and (f) in response to our due diligence inquiries, requests and investigations for the purpose of this opinion, all the factual information and materials provided to us by Holdco or its Affiliates are true, accurate, complete and not misleading, and that Holdco has not withheld anything that, if disclosed to us, would reasonably cause us to alter this opinion in whole or in part.
Based on the foregoing and subject to the limitations and qualifications below, we are of the opinion that:
1.        Each of the PRC Parties has all necessary power and authority to enter into each of the Transaction Documents to which it/he is a party, to carry out its/his obligations thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. Each of the Transaction Documents has been duly executed and delivered by each of the PRC Parties, where appropriate, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each PRC Party, enforceable against such PRC Party in accordance with their respective terms. Other than the approvals, filings and registrations set forth in Schedule II hereto (the absence of which shall not affect the validity of the Transaction Documents), the entering into, delivery and performance of the Transactions Documents by each of the PRC Parties, where appropriate, are not subject to any other government approvals, filings and registrations under the PRC Laws.
2.        The execution, delivery and due performance of the Transaction Documents by each of the PRC Parties and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will not (i) contravene any provision of PRC Laws, or (ii) result in any violation of the business license and the articles of association of the Holdco and Opco.
3.        The choice of New York law as the governing law of the Transaction Documents, excluding the Real Estate and Equity Option Agreement, and the choice of PRC law as the governing law of the Real Estate and Equity Option Agreement, are valid choices of law under the laws of the PRC respectively and the courts of the PRC will honor such choice of law. The arbitration clauses in each of the Transaction Documents are valid, binding and enforceable. Any arbitration award granted by the relevant arbitration tribunal based upon the relevant Transaction Documents would be
 
declared enforceable against the relevant PRC Parties by the courts of the PRC, subject to compliance of the relevant civil procedure requirements under PRC Laws.
This opinion is subject to the following qualifications:
(a)        This opinion is, in so far as it relates to the enforceability of a contract, subject to (A) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, (B) possible judicial or administrative actions or any PRC Laws affecting creditors' rights, and (C) judicial discretion with respect to the availability of indemnifications, remedies or defenses, the calculation of damages, the entitlement to attorneys fees and other costs, the waiver of immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from legal process.
(b)        The indemnification obligations of Holdco under Section 12 of the Commercial Agreement and Section 8 of the Intellectual Property License and Software Technology Services Agreement, if involving any payment obligations to an offshore indemnified person, may be deemed as a foreign guarantee under the PRC Laws. Therefore, the effectiveness of such indemnification provisions may be subject to the approval by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ("").
SAFE
(c)        This opinion relates only to PRC Laws and we express no opinion as to any laws other than PRC Laws. As used herein, "" means all laws, statutes, regulations, orders, decrees, notices, circulars, judicial interpretations and other legislations of the PRC effective and available to the public as of the date hereof and there is no guarantee that any of such PRC Laws will not be changed, amended or revoked in the immediate future or in the longer term with or without retroactive effect. We do not, and do not purport to, opine on the interpretation or application of any accounting principles.
PRC Laws
This opinion is intended to be used in the context which is specifically referred to herein and each paragraph should be looked at as a whole and no part should be extracted and referred to independently.
This opinion is solely for the benefit of the persons to whom it is addressed, for the purpose of the transactions contemplated under the Transaction Documents. It may not be relied upon by anyone else or used for any other purpose, in each instance, without our prior written consent.

SECTION 7.    .
Remedies
(a)            Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Secured Party shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement or any other Document, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC and other applicable laws, including the sale, collection or other realization on the Pledge Collateral, and may (i) to the extent the Obligations are then due and owing, apply the proceeds thereof to the Obligations then due and owing, and (ii) otherwise, hold such proceeds itself as collateral for the Obligations not yet due and owing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Pledgor agrees that any item of the Pledged Collateral may be sold for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk, in any number of lots at the same or different times, at any exchange, brokers' board or elsewhere, by public or private sale, and at such times and on such terms, as Secured Party shall determine; , , that Pledgor shall be credited with the net proceeds of sale only when such proceeds are finally collected by Secured Party in cash. Secured Party shall give Pledgor such notice of any private or public sales as may be required by the UCC or other applicable Law. Pledgor recognizes that Secured Party may be unable to make a public sale of any or all of the Pledged Collateral, by reason of prohibitions contained in applicable securities laws or otherwise, and expressly agrees that a private sale to a restricted group of purchasers for investment and not with a view to any distribution thereof shall be considered a commercially reasonable sale. Secured Party and Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale, and, to the extent permitted by Law, upon any such private sale, to purchase the whole or any part of the Pledged Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption, which right or equity of redemption Pledgor hereby releases to the extent permitted by law.
provided
however
(b)            The cash proceeds actually received from the sale or other disposition or collection of Pledged Collateral, and any other amounts received in respect of the Pledged Collateral the application of which is not otherwise provided for herein, shall be applied to the payment of the Obligations as the same become due and payable. Any surplus thereof which exists after payment and performance in full of the Obligations shall be promptly paid over to Pledgor or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the UCC or other applicable Law. Pledgor shall remain liable to Secured Party, as Agent and Lender for any deficiency which exists after any sale or other disposition or collection of Pledged Collateral.
(c)            Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any release or termination of Pledged Collateral, or any sale or other disposition of Pledged Collateral by Secured Party, may result in the liquidation of time deposits constituting all or a portion of the Pledged Collateral, whether or not such time deposits have matured and notwithstanding the fact that such liquidation may give rise to penalties or other breakage costs as a result of an early withdrawal of funds.
 
(d)            Pledgor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) any right of redemption with respect to the Pledged Collateral, whether before or after sale hereunder, and all rights, if any, of marshalling of the Pledged Collateral or other collateral or security for the Obligations; (ii) any right to require Secured Party or Lender (A) to proceed against any Person, (B) to exhaust any other collateral or security for any of the Obligations, (C) to pursue any remedy in Secured Party's or Lender's power, or (D) to make or give any presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protests or notices of dishonor in connection with any of the Pledged Collateral; and (iii) all claims, damages, and demands against Secured Party or Lender arising out of the repossession, retention, sale or application of the proceeds of any sale of the Pledged Collateral, other than those resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Secured Party or Lender.
(e)            Pledgor waives any right it may have to require Secured Party or any Lender to pursue any third person for any of the Obligations. Secured Party may comply with any applicable state or federal Law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Pledged Collateral and compliance will not be considered adversely to affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Pledged Collateral. Secured Party may sell the Pledged Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Pledged Collateral. Secured Party may specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered adversely to affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Pledged Collateral. If Secured Party sells any of the Pledged Collateral upon credit, Pledgor will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser, received by Secured Party and applied to the indebtedness of the purchaser. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Pledged Collateral, Secured Party may resell the Pledged Collateral and Pledgor shall be credited with the proceeds of the sale.

(b)            Pledgor shall give prompt written notice to Secured Party (and in any event not later than 30 days following any change described below in this subsection) of: (i) any change in the location of Pledgor's principal address; or (ii) any change in his name.
(c)            Except in accordance with the last sentence of Section 7.15(l) of the Framework Agreement, Pledgor will not exchange, sell, convey, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of or transfer the Pledged Collateral or any right, title or interest therein.
(d)            Pledgor will not create, incur or willingly permit to exist any Liens upon or with respect to the Pledged Collateral, other than the security interest of and pledge to Secured Party created by this Agreement.
(e)            Pledgor will not cast any vote, give or grant any consent, waiver or ratification or take any action with respect to the Pledged Collateral which would have the effect of impairing the position or interest of Secured Party or Lender in respect of the Pledged Collateral or which would be inconsistent with or violate any provision of any Documents.
(f)            Pledgor will not close any Investment Account or terminate any Deposit without obtaining the prior written consent of Secured Party. Pledgor will give Secured Party prompt notice of any change in or to any account number or other identifying information for any Investment Account or Deposit, or any change in the name or address of the securities intermediary for any Investment Account or bank for any Deposit.
SECTION 6.    .  Any of the following events which shall occur and be continuing shall constitute an "Event of Default":
Events of Default
(a)            Pledgor or HoldCo shall fail to pay any of the Obligations when due.

(e)            Any levy upon, seizure or attachment of any of the Pledged Collateral.
(f)            Any "Event of Default" (as defined in any other Shortfall Security Document) shall occur and not be cured within five (5) Business Days following its occurrence.
SECTION 7.    .
Remedies
(a)            Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Secured Party shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement or any other Document, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC and other applicable laws, including the sale, collection or other realization on the Pledge Collateral, and may (i) to the extent the Obligations are then due and owing, apply the proceeds thereof to the Obligations then due and owing, and (ii) otherwise, hold such proceeds itself as collateral for the Obligations not yet due and owing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Pledgor agrees that any item of the Pledged Collateral may be sold for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk, in any number of lots at the same or different times, at any exchange, brokers' board or elsewhere, by public or private sale, and at such times and on such terms, as Secured Party shall determine; , , that Pledgor shall be credited with the net proceeds of sale only when such proceeds are finally collected by Secured Party in cash. Secured Party shall give Pledgor such notice of any private or public sales as may be required by the UCC or other applicable Law. Pledgor recognizes that Secured Party may be unable to make a public sale of any or all of the Pledged Collateral, by reason of prohibitions contained in applicable securities laws or otherwise, and expressly agrees that a private sale to a restricted group of purchasers for investment and not with a view to any distribution thereof shall be considered a commercially reasonable sale. Secured Party and Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale, and, to the extent permitted by Law, upon any such private sale, to purchase the whole or any part of the Pledged Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption, which right or equity of redemption Pledgor hereby releases to the extent permitted by law.
provided
however
(b)            The cash proceeds actually received from the sale or other disposition or collection of Pledged Collateral, and any other amounts received in respect of the Pledged Collateral the application of which is not otherwise provided for herein, shall be applied to the payment of the Obligations as the same become due and payable. Any surplus thereof which exists after payment and performance in full of the Obligations shall be promptly paid over to Pledgor or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the UCC or other applicable Law. Pledgor shall remain liable to Secured Party, as Agent and Lender for any deficiency which exists after any sale or other disposition or collection of Pledged Collateral.
(c)            Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any release or termination of Pledged Collateral, or any sale or other disposition of Pledged Collateral by Secured Party, may result in the liquidation of time deposits constituting all or a portion of the Pledged Collateral, whether or not such time deposits have matured and notwithstanding the fact that such liquidation may give rise to penalties or other breakage costs as a result of an early withdrawal of funds.
 
(d)            Pledgor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) any right of redemption with respect to the Pledged Collateral, whether before or after sale hereunder, and all rights, if any, of marshalling of the Pledged Collateral or other collateral or security for the Obligations; (ii) any right to require Secured Party or Lender (A) to proceed against any Person, (B) to exhaust any other collateral or security for any of the Obligations, (C) to pursue any remedy in Secured Party's or Lender's power, or (D) to make or give any presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protests or notices of dishonor in connection with any of the Pledged Collateral; and (iii) all claims, damages, and demands against Secured Party or Lender arising out of the repossession, retention, sale or application of the proceeds of any sale of the Pledged Collateral, other than those resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Secured Party or Lender.
(e)            Pledgor waives any right it may have to require Secured Party or any Lender to pursue any third person for any of the Obligations. Secured Party may comply with any applicable state or federal Law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Pledged Collateral and compliance will not be considered adversely to affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Pledged Collateral. Secured Party may sell the Pledged Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Pledged Collateral. Secured Party may specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered adversely to affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Pledged Collateral. If Secured Party sells any of the Pledged Collateral upon credit, Pledgor will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser, received by Secured Party and applied to the indebtedness of the purchaser. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Pledged Collateral, Secured Party may resell the Pledged Collateral and Pledgor shall be credited with the proceeds of the sale.
