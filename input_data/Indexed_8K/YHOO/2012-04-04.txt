On April 4, 2012, Yahoo! Inc. (the "Company") began notifying approximately 2,000 employees whose employment will be terminated as part of an overall plan to reshape the Company for the future. The Company expects to incur severance and other related costs in conjunction with this action. Total charges are expected to include cash costs as well as charges or credits related to stock-based compensation expense and may include facilities, lease and other charges.

The Company estimates it will incur pre-tax cash charges of $125 million to $145 million for severance pay expenses and related cash expenditures. The Company expects to recognize the majority of these charges in the quarter ended June 30, 2012, with the remaining costs to be recognized through June 30, 2013. The pre-tax cash charge estimate does not include facilities, lease or other charges the Company may incur as part of this action.
