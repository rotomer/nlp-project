On October 18, 2012, Yahoo! Inc. (the "Company") began notifying employees whose employment will be terminated as a result of the Company's plan to close its Korean business by December 31, 2012. The decision is part of the Company's effort to streamline its operations and focus its resources. Approximately 200 employees will be terminated as part of the closure of the Korean business.
The Company expects to incur pre-tax cash charges related to its plan to close its Korean business for severance pay expenses, lease and other contract termination charges. Total charges are expected to include these cash charges and also non-cash charges related to the write-off of goodwill and other assets related to its Korea operations. The Company expects to recognize the majority of the total pre-tax charges in the quarter ending December 31, 2012 but is unable, at this time, to estimate the amount of cash and total charges it will incur.
