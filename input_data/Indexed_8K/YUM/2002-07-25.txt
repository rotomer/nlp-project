David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO said,
"Yum! Brands had an outstanding first half, and we expect continued earnings growth for the balance of the year. Our second-quarter results were even better than expected, driven by exceptional performance at our international business and Taco Bell.
"International revenues grew at a record rate of 18%, and international ongoing operating profits increased 47%. U.S. blended company same-store sales increased 3%, and U.S. ongoing operating profit grew 16%. Taco Bell led the way with 8% company same-store sales growth.
"We also continued to make significant progress in executing our innovative and unique multibranding strategy where we offer our customers the choice of two great brands in one restaurant. To this end, we successfully completed the acquisition of the Long John Silver's and A&W restaurant brands. The addition of these two brands more than triples the long-term opportunities for multibranded locations in the U.S. to more than 13,000 restaurants. Combinations of these two brands with KFC and Taco Bell on average drive 20% to 30% increases in sales and at least a 30% increase in average unit cash flow.
"Importantly, we are steadily improving restaurant operations and our customer satisfaction measures. We have successfully launched our global Customer Mania initiative with the objective of training our 725,000 system team members globally in customer satisfaction skills each and every quarter, every year. We believe our operational focus will improve our customers' experiences and allow us to drive sales results.
"For the third quarter, we expect ongoing operating EPS to grow at a low- to mid-teens rate resulting in a range of $0.45 to $0.47 per share. Given both the strength of our results in the first half of 2002 and our outlook for the third quarter, we are raising our full-year 2002 ongoing operating EPS guidance from a range of $1.82-$1.85 to at least $1.88."
Following is an update on Yum! Brands' business segments and key drivers, which include global expansion, portfolio of leading U.S. brands, multibranding, franchise fees and cash generation and returns:

Prior to foreign exchange conversion to U.S. dollars.
In the second quarter and year to date for Yum! Brands' international business, net new-restaurant development was the primary driver of revenue growth.
For the full year 2002, the company expects, in U.S. dollar terms, international revenues to grow at a low- to mid-teens rate and ongoing operating profit to grow at least 20%. Based on current foreign currency rates, the company expects an approximate neutral to slightly positive impact of foreign currency conversion on ongoing operating profit for the year. The Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Korean won, and Mexican peso are all important currencies in the company's international business.

Includes company same-store sales growth for KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell.
In the second quarter for Yum! Brands' U.S. portfolio, blended same-store sales at company restaurants increased 3% and consisted of an 8% increase at Taco Bell, a 3% increase at KFC, and a 3% decrease at Pizza Hut. An increase in system-wide blended same-store sales drove 3 percentage points of revenue growth, and the acquisition of Long John Silver's and A&W contributed 4 percentage points of revenue growth. The acquisition occurred during Week 7 of the 12-week second quarter.
Year to date, blended portfolio same-store sales at company restaurants increased 4% and consisted of an 8% increase at Taco Bell, a 4% increase at KFC, and same-store sales that were even with last year at Pizza Hut. Increases in system-wide blended same-store sales drove revenue growth.
For the full year 2002, the company expects U.S. blended company same-store sales growth of 3%, U.S. revenues to increase 9% to 10% and U.S. ongoing operating profit to increase at a high single-digit rate. The company expects the acquisition of Long John Silver's and A&W to contribute 6 to 7 percentage points of revenue growth on a full-year basis. Additionally, for the U.S. business, the company expects the adoption of SFAS 142 to contribute 2 to 3 percentage points and the acquisition of Long John Silver's and A&W to contribute 1 to 2 percentage points of ongoing operating profit growth on a full-year basis.

Excluding licensed locations
Excludes the impact of the Long John Silver's and A&W acquisition
Restaurant growth in the company's four high-growth international markets - China, Mexico, Korea, and the U.K. - drove worldwide and international net restaurant growth versus second-quarter 2001. Versus second-quarter 2001, net restaurant growth was 40% in China, 13% in Korea, 12% in Mexico, and 9% in the U.K.
One point not reflected, which primarily affects U.S. net restaurant-growth statistics, is the impact of multibranding on our U.S. restaurant system. Multibrand conversions, while increasing the sales and points of distribution of the added brand, result in no additional unit counts. Though no additional unit counts are realized, these conversions generally drive significant increases in same-store sales and result in upgraded, new-image restaurants for the U.S. business. Similarly, a newly opened multibrand unit, while increasing sales and points of distribution of two brands, results in just one additional unit count.
For the full-year 2002, we expect 5% to 6% net growth in international restaurants and no change in the U.S. This forecast excludes licensed locations.

In the quarter, U.S. net additions totaled 47 and international five. In the U.S., company and franchise net additions were 27 and 20 respectively. About 50% of the U.S. multibrand additions represented conversions of existing single-brand restaurants, and 50% represented new-restaurant openings.
Our multibranding program with KFC and Taco Bell partnering with Long John Silver's and A&W continues to grow with 14 additions completed during the quarter. Results remain very strong with average unit volume increases of 20% to 30%.
In 2002, Yum! Brands continues to expect to add at least 325 company and franchise multibranded restaurants through new-restaurant openings and conversions of existing restaurants. About 60% of these additions are expected to be conversions of single-brand restaurants to multibrands and 40% are expected to be new multibrand restaurants.

In the second quarter and year to date, positive worldwide franchise same-store sales growth drove franchise-fee growth. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted year-over-year growth for the second quarter and year to date by one percentage point. The acquisition of Long John Silver's and A&W contributed one percentage point of franchise-fee growth in the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis.
For the full year 2002, the company expects franchise fees to grow to at least $850 million.

Q2
Year to Date
Ongoing operating earnings (after interest and tax expense) plus depreciation and amortization.
Excludes the acquisition of Long John Silver's and A&W
Cash generated for the second quarter included $53 million of employee stock-option proceeds.
For 2002, the company expects cash flow from ongoing operations to exceed $925 million, which more than funds capital-expenditure needs of an estimated $800 million. Additionally, the company expects total cash generated to be nearly $1.2 billion, including $200 million of proceeds from stock-option exercises and $65 million from after-tax refranchising proceeds.
THIRD-QUARTER 2002 OUTLOOK
The company expects to earn $0.45 to $0.47 in ongoing operating EPS.
Projected factors contributing to the company's EPS expectations are . . .
International system-sales growth of 8% to 9% in U.S. dollar terms, or 7% to 8% prior to foreign exchange conversion. Revenue growth at a low- to mid-teens rate in both U.S. dollars and prior to foreign exchange conversion.
International ongoing operating profit growth of at least 20% in U.S. dollar terms or 17% prior to foreign currency conversion.
U.S. portfolio blended company same-store sales of 2% to 3%. Revenue growth of 16% to 17%. The Long John Silver's and A&W acquisition contributes 13 to 14 percentage points of growth for the quarter.
U.S. ongoing operating profit growth of at least 15%. The Long John Silver's and A&W acquisition contributes 4 percentage points of growth.
Worldwide company restaurant margin up at least 1.0 percentage point versus last year including a projected 0.5 percentage-point benefit from the adoption of SFAS 142.
General and administrative expenses up 15% in U.S. dollar terms versus last year, up 5% versus last year excluding the Long John Silver's and A&W acquisition. Timing of spending on strategic initiatives such as the development of international markets, expansion of our multibranding program, and operational improvement initiatives are driving increased spending versus last year in the quarter.
Interest expense up $4 million versus last year; down slightly versus last year excluding the Long John Silver's and A&W acquisition.
Ongoing operating tax rate of 31% to 32%.
Diluted average shares outstanding of about 311 to 313 million, up 5 to 7 million shares or about 2% higher versus last year.
YEAR-2002 OUTLOOK
Yum! Brands now expects to earn at least $1.88 of ongoing operating EPS for the full year. Our previous guidance was $1.82-$1.85 of ongoing operating EPS.
JUNE/JULY (PERIOD 7) SALES
Estimated U.S. portfolio blended same-store sales at company restaurants increased 3% during the four-week period ended July 13, 2002 (Period 7). For the comparable four-week period, U.S. same-store sales increased 9% at Taco Bell and 3% at KFC and decreased 2% at Pizza Hut.
For Period 7, International system sales increased 14% prior to foreign currency conversion or 15% after conversion to U.S. dollars. Year-to-date international system sales increased 10% prior to foreign currency conversion or 7% after conversion to U.S. dollars.
Same-store sales results for Period 8, 2002 (primarily the latter half of July and first half of August for the U.S. business), will be released Thursday, August 15, 2002, prior to the Market's opening.

Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") in its entirety. In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 142, we ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles as of December 30, 2001. The following table summarizes the favorable effect of SFAS 142 on restaurant margin and ongoing operating profit had SFAS 142 been effective in the second quarter and year-to-date of 2001:

Additionally, if SFAS 142 had been effective for the second quarter and year-to-date 2001, reported net income would have increased approximately $6 million and $11 million, respectively, and ongoing operating EPS on a post-split basis would have increased $0.02 and $0.04, respectively.
