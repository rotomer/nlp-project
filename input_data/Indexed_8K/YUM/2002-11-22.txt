David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO said: "The Board's action reflects its belief that the company's shares are undervalued and represent an outstanding long-term investment opportunity given our operating performance, and our unique multibranding and international growth prospects."
"We have the cash flow to reinvest in our businesses, exceed our debt repayment targets, and invest in our own stock. All of these actions are consistent with our objective to continue to enhance value for our shareholders and build a strong balance sheet," Novak added.
Repurchases of common stock may be made from time to time in open market and/or privately negotiated transactions, and will be subject to market conditions and other factors. Since Yum! Brands began its share repurchase program in 1999, the company has purchased 31.2 million shares for $650 million at an average price of $20.83.
