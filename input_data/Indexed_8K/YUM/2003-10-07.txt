LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 7, 2003--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM): -- INCREASES FULL-YEAR 2003 EPS GUIDANCE TO AT LEAST $2.03 PRIOR TO SPECIAL ITEMS. REPORTED EPS IS EXPECTED TO BE $1.94, INCLUDING $0.09 OF SPECIAL-ITEMS CHARGES. -- REPORTS PERIOD 10 ESTIMATED INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM SALES INCREASED 14% IN U.S. DOLLAR TERMS OR 10% PRIOR TO U.S. DOLLAR CONVERSION. -- REPORTS PERIOD 10 ESTIMATED U.S. BLENDED SAME-STORE SALES AT COMPANY RESTAURANTS INCREASED 1% VERSUS LAST YEAR. Yum! Brands Inc. today reported results for the third quarter ended September 6, 2003. Key highlights for the quarter were -- 6% increase in traditional international restaurants in operation versus end of third quarter 2002. -- 20% increase in international franchise and license fees versus third quarter 2002. -- 18% increase in U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation versus end of third quarter 2002. -- The company paid down debt of $137 million, invested capital of $145 million and repurchased shares, spending $39 million. The company took a $6.8 million pretax special-items charge this quarter for interest charges related to the previously announced legal judgment against Taco Bell in Wrench v. Taco Bell Corp.

Future interest charges will be accrued until the appeal process is concluded.

See attachments to this press release for reconciliations of non-GAAP measurements to GAAP results. See the attachments to this press release for a description of Estimated System Sales, a key operating metric. David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said: "Continued robust new international restaurant growth, a strengthening in international same-store sales versus our expectations and another solid performance by Taco Bell contributed to 17 percent growth in EPS before special items. Additionally, Pizza Hut had one of its best quarters in same-store-sales growth since the first half of 2001. "While both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell had positive sales performances, continued weakness at KFC negatively impacted U.S. blended same-store-sales results. We have made a major change in the KFC brand's leadership by appointing a new president and a new chief marketing and food innovation officer. We fully expect this team to turn around KFC's business performance. "Given our overall performance and the strength of the largest businesses in our global portfolio, we are increasing our 2003 EPS guidance to at least $2.03 before special items. We are confident, looking ahead to 2004, of continuing to deliver our stated goal of at least 10 percent growth in EPS. Our confidence is based on the progress we are making towards executing our three key strategies: international new-restaurant growth, U.S. multibrand innovation and expansion, and differentiation of our core-brand portfolio by dramatically improving U.S. restaurant operations. This combination of strategies is unique to the restaurant industry and makes us anything but an ordinary restaurant company." Following is an update on Yum! Brands' international and U.S. businesses as well as key business-growth drivers, which include international expansion, multibrand innovation and expansion in the U.S., portfolio of category-leading brands, franchise-fee growth and substantial cash generation with high returns.

"Traditional System Units" excludes licensed locations and includes company-owned, franchise and joint-venture restaurants. See the attachments to this press release for a description of Estimated System Sales, a key operating metric. In the third quarter for the company's international business, continued expansion of our key international brands -- KFC and Pizza Hut -- was the primary driver of revenue and operating-profit growth. Same-store sales in company markets and the overall system were down versus last year. Markets and businesses with positive same-store sales included KFC Australia, the U.K., Pizza Hut Korea, the Middle East and KFC South Africa. Markets and businesses experiencing negative growth included China, Japan, Mexico and Taiwan KFC. Restaurant margins were down in the third quarter primarily due to sales deleverage in Mexico. The favorable impact of foreign currency conversion added $6 million to operating profit for the third quarter. UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ---------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Quarter Year to Date ---------------------------------------------------- million, except unit counts and percentages 2003 2002 Incr/(Decr) 2003 2002 Incr/(Decr) ---------------------------------------------------- Revenues $1,337 $1,322 +1% $3,917 $3,656 +7% Restaurant (1.4) (1.8) Margin % 14.8 16.2 ppts 14.5 16.3 ppts Operating Profit $204 $205 Even $572 $563 +2% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Metrics Traditional System Units 18,753 18,861 (1)% 18,753 18,861 (1)% Multibrand Units 2,018 1,715 +18% 2,018 1,715 18% Est. System-Sales Growth Even +4% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to the preceding table: "Traditional System Units" excludes licensed locations and includes company-owned, franchise and joint-venture restaurants. See the attachments to this press release for a description of Estimated System Sales, a key operating metric. In the third quarter, U.S. blended same-store sales for franchise (estimated) and company restaurants were both even with the same period last year. In the third quarter, U.S. restaurant margin was negatively impacted by sales deleverage at KFC, higher commodity costs (primarily cheese and beef) and higher occupancy costs. Traditional system units decreased slightly primarily due to A&W single-brand and Pizza Hut dine-in restaurant closures. The company expects these modest restaurant declines will continue in the near term for these two brands. A&W distribution is expected to grow as the brand is paired with KFC and Long John Silver's in a multibrand format. This expanded A&W distribution would be reflected in KFC and Long John Silver's multibrand units. Taco Bell and KFC restaurant counts were approximately even versus the prior year. WORLDWIDE NEW-RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT - ------------------------------------ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- New-Restaurant Openings Third Quarter Year to Date ------------- -------------- Worldwide 305 865 International 213 616 United States 92 249 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note to the preceding table: "New-Restaurant Openings" excludes licensed locations. Worldwide new-restaurant openings for the third quarter were driven by growth in new international restaurants from our global brands: KFC and Pizza Hut. Primary growth drivers were four key international markets -- China, the U.K., Mexico and Korea -- with 94 new restaurant openings this quarter. Franchise and joint-venture partners opened 70% of systemwide new international restaurants year to date. Net traditional restaurant count increased 31% in China, 12% in Mexico, 9% in the U.K., and 2% in Korea versus the end of the third quarter 2002. In key franchise markets year-over-year unit growth was 10% in Asia, 5% in the Middle East, 4% in South Africa and 5% in Caribbean/Latin America. This discussion excludes changes in licensed-unit locations, which are expected to have no material impact on the company's overall profit performance in 2003. Licensed locations are typically nontraditional sites, such as airports, that normally have substantially lower average unit volumes than traditional restaurant locations. MULTIBRAND EXPANSION - -------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Quarter Multibrand Restaurants in Operation 2003 2002 Incr/(Decr) ------ ------ ----------- U.S. Systemwide 2,018 1,715 +18% % U.S. System Units 11% 9% +2 ppts - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note to the preceding table: "System Units" excludes licensed locations. In the third quarter, 108 multibrand restaurants were added in the U.S., bringing the total to 234 U.S. multibrand additions year to date. In the U.S., third-quarter company and franchise additions were 65 and 43 respectively. Approximately 50% of the U.S. multibrand additions are expected to be conversions of existing single-brand restaurants, and 50% are expected to be new-restaurant openings for full year 2003. FRANCHISE GROWTH AND FEES - ------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Quarter Year to Date ------------- ------------ Franchise Restaurant Net Growth Vs. Q3 2002 +1% +1% Total Franchise Fees ($ million) $224 $642 Growth Vs. 2002 +6% +8% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to the preceding table: "Franchise Restaurant" includes joint ventures; excludes licensed restaurants. "Franchise Fees" includes fees from joint ventures and licensed restaurants. Fees are for ongoing royalties and initial fees. For the third quarter, favorable foreign currency conversion added 2 percentage points of franchise-fee growth. Excluding foreign currency conversion, franchise fees increased 4%, primarily driven by net new-restaurant development and increased international royalty rates. CASH-FLOW GENERATION - -------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- $ million cash inflow/(cash outflow) Third Quarter Year to Date ------------- ------------ Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 405 769 Proceeds from Refranchising Restaurants - 11 Employee Stock-Option Proceeds 36 70 Sales of Property, Plant and Equipment 9 29 ------------- ------------ Total Cash Generated 450 879 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital Spending and Franchise Acquisitions (145) (388) Debt -- Net Proceeds/(Payments) (137) (218) Repurchase Shares of Common Stock (39) (121) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to the preceding table: -- See the attachments to this press release for reconciliations of non-GAAP measurements to GAAP results. -- Number of shares repurchased: 1,330,000 in the third quarter and 4,657,700 year to date. -- See the attachments to this press release for the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For third quarter and year to date, the company more than funded capital spending with net cash provided by operating activities. Additional cash was generated from employee stock-option proceeds and sales of property, plant and equipment. As a result, the company was able to reduce debt and repurchase stock as indicated in the preceding table. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company contributed $130 million in cash to the closed pension plan. FOURTH-QUARTER 2003 OUTLOOK The company is comfortable with the current consensus estimate of $0.62 in reported EPS in the fourth quarter. At this time, the company expects no net special-items EPS impact in the quarter. This is an increase of $0.07, or 11%, compared to last year's performance, prior to a gain of $0.01 from special items in 2002. Projected factors contributing to the company's EPS expectations are -- International system-sales growth of +8% to +9% prior to foreign currency conversion, or +12% to +13% after conversion to U.S. dollars. Year-over-year net growth in international traditional restaurants of +5% to +6% will be the primary driver with slightly positive same-store-sales growth expected systemwide. -- Based on current foreign currency rates, the company expects a benefit of $5 to $6 million from foreign currency conversion on operating profit for the fourth quarter. The Chinese renminbi, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Korean won, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, and Mexican peso are important currencies in the company's international business. -- U.S. blended same-store-sales growth for company restaurants of approximately 1%. -- Worldwide company restaurant margin is expected to be down approximately 1.5 percentage points from fourth quarter last year. International margin is expected to decline by approximately 1 percentage point. -- General and administrative expenses flat versus last year in U.S. dollar terms. -- Interest expense down approximately $9 million from last year. -- Refranchising gains slightly higher than last year. -- A targeted tax rate before special items of 29% to 31% versus 30% last year. ANNUAL OUTLOOK The company expects earnings per share to grow at least 10% each year with the continued execution of its three key strategies: (1) international new-restaurant growth; (2) multibrand restaurant innovation and expansion in the U.S.; and (3) dramatically improving restaurant operations and differentiating our core-brand portfolio. For 2003, the company expects worldwide revenue growth of 7% to 8%, which includes 2 percentage points from the favorable impact of the Long John Silver's and A&W acquisition, at least 2% worldwide traditional system restaurant growth and U.S. company blended same-store sales even with last year. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Forecast Actual 2003 2002 Incr/(Decr) -------- ------ ----------- EPS Before Special Items $2.03 $1.82 +11% Special Items EPS $(0.09) $0.06 NM -------- ------ Reported EPS $1.94 $1.88 +3% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERIOD 10 SALES Period 10 estimated international system sales increased 10% prior to foreign currency conversion or 14% after conversion to U.S. dollars.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. Special items include the GAAP income statement captions of Wrench litigation, AmeriServe and other charges (credits) and the Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax. These amounts are described in (d), (e) and (f) in the accompanying notes. The Company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations.

This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace presentations of cash flows in accordance with GAAP. Rather, we use total cash generated to measure Company cash flow internally, and the presentation of total cash generated provides additional information to investors as to cash available to the Company to fund capital spending, repurchases of shares of common stock and debt repayments. Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Total Cash Generated - ------------------------------------------------ Quarter Year to date --------- ------------ Net cash provided by operating activities $405 $769 Proceeds from refranchising of restaurants - 11 Sales of property, plant and equipment 9 29 Employee stock option proceeds 36 70 --------- ------------ Total cash generated $450 $879 ========= ============ Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (a) Percentages may not recompute due to rounding. (b) Other (income) expense includes the following: Quarter Year to date --------------- --------------- 9/6/03 9/7/02 9/6/03 9/7/02 ------- ------- ------- ------- Store closure costs $- $4 $(2) $17 Store impairment charges 3 12 13 24 Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates (9) (6) (22) (19) Foreign exchange net loss (gain) (1) (1) (2) (1) ------- ------- ------- ------- Other (income) expense $(7) $9 $(13) $21 ======= ======= ======= ======= (c) Refranchising net loss (gain) includes write-downs of approximately $5 million ($3 million after tax) and $15 million ($9 million after tax) for the quarter and year to date ended September 6, 2003, respectively, to reflect estimates of the fair value of an international market which is held for sale. (d) The amounts recorded as Wrench litigation for the year to date ended September 6, 2003 reflect the legal judgment against Taco Bell Corp. on June 4, 2003 in Wrench v. Taco Bell Corp. and related interest. The amount recorded as Wrench litigation for the quarter ended September 6, 2003 reflects the interest accrued for the passage of time during the quarter and an adjustment to previously recorded interest necessary as a result of an amended judgment on September 9, 2003. (e) The amount recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the quarter ended September 6, 2003 primarily resulted from the reversal of reserves associated with the settlement of certain wage and hour litigation. The amount recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the year to date ended September 6, 2003 primarily resulted from recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process and the reversal of reserves associated with the settlement of certain wage and hour litigation, partially offset by costs to defend certain wage and hour litigation and integration costs related to our acquisition of Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. ("YGR"). Amounts recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the quarter and year to date ended September 7, 2002, which were referred to as unusual items in 2002, primarily resulted from recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process partially offset by costs to defend certain wage and hour litigation and integration costs related to the acquisition of YGR. (f) Effective December 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. As a result of obligations under certain leases that are within the scope of SFAS 143, the Company has recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2 million ($1 million after tax). The adoption of SFAS 143 did not materially affect the results of our operations for the quarter or year to date ended September 6, 2003, nor do we anticipate that it will materially affect the results of operations in future periods. (g) System sales include the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including company-owned, franchise, joint-venture and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, joint-venture and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for us (typically at a rate of 4% - 6% of sales). Franchise, joint-venture and license restaurant sales are not included in the Company sales we present on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the fees are included in the Company's revenues. We believe that system sales are useful to investors as a significant indicator of our Company's market share relative to competitors and the overall strength of our brands in the market place.
