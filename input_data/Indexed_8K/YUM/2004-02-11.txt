Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands, Inc. Reports Record Earnings Per Share in 2003 of $2.06, an Increase of 13% Prior to Special Items; Reported EPS Was $2.02 Including Special Items LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 11, 2004--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM): -- Announces record fourth-quarter Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $0.65 prior to special items, an increase of 16%. Including a special-items gain of $0.05, reported EPS was $0.70, an increase of 23%. -- Increases full-year 2004 EPS guidance by $0.04 to at least $2.27 prior to special items, or reported EPS to at least $2.29. Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported results for the fourth quarter ended December 27, 2003. Key highlights for fourth-quarter 2003 performance versus fourth-quarter 2002: -- International system sales increased 10% prior to foreign currency conversion, its strongest quarterly performance of 2003. -- The number of international system restaurants in operation expanded by over 5% driven by record new-restaurant openings of 1,108. -- International franchise and license fees grew 25%. -- International restaurant margin increased to 15.9%, a fourth-quarter record. -- Taco Bell same-store sales increased 4%, its strongest quarterly performance of 2003. -- U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation expanded by 18%. The company ended the year with the lowest debt balance in its history -- $2.1 billion. The company recorded a $25 million pretax special-items gain related to recoveries from the AmeriServe bankruptcy estate in the fourth quarter. These potential recoveries have been previously discussed in Forms 10-Q and 10-K. Consolidated Financial Highlights Fourth % Change Full % Change Quarter Vs. Year Vs. 2003 Prior Year 2003 Prior Year -------- ---------- ------- ---------- System Restaurants 30,837 1 30,837 1 Systemwide Same-Store-Sales Growth 2% NM Even NM Revenues ($ million) $2,653 8 $8,380 8 EPS prior to Special Items $0.65 16 $2.06 13 Special Items EPS $0.05 NM $(0.04) NM Reported EPS $0.70 23 $2.02 7 David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said: "I'm pleased to report that in 2003 we showed the underlying strength of our global portfolio of leading brands. With continued profitable international restaurant expansion and Taco Bell's strong sales and profits, we achieved 13% growth in EPS prior to special items. This growth was achieved in spite of a difficult global environment, which included SARS, the war in Iraq and a soft economy early in 2003. Our ongoing goal is to continue to grow EPS at least 10% each year. We expect to do at least that in 2004. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide business achieved 16% EPS growth and record EPS of $0.65. We have solid plans in place to continue building on the unique growth opportunities that make us anything but your ordinary restaurant company: steady improvement in operations, profitable international expansion and multibranding category-leading brands. "Given the strength of our fourth-quarter performance we have raised our full-year 2004 EPS estimate $0.04 to at least $2.27 or at least 10% growth prior to special items. We expect to grow U.S. same-store sales on a blended basis at least 1% to 2%, open at least 1,400 new restaurants worldwide, and add at least 500 U.S. multibrand restaurants in 2004."

System- Sales Growth +17% +10% +14% +7% System Restaurants 12,171 11,538 +5% NA 12,171 11,538 +5% NA A key factor for this business segment is profitable new-restaurant expansion. Importantly, for 2003, a record 1,108 international system restaurants were opened. These included 663 KFC and 396 Pizza Hut restaurants. In the fourth quarter, continued expansion of our key international brands -- KFC and Pizza Hut -- and positive same-store sales were drivers of international revenue, system-sales and operating-profit growth. Markets and businesses with positive same-store sales included China, KFC Australia, the U.K., Pizza Hut Korea, the Middle East and KFC South Africa. Markets and businesses experiencing negative same-store sales included Japan, Mexico, Canada and KFC Taiwan. Fourth-quarter international system-sales growth prior to foreign currency conversion was 10%, one percentage point greater than previously estimated in our Period 13 sales release, issued January 6, 2004. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased 0.3 percentage points in the quarter or 0.5 percentage points prior to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Restaurant margin of 15.9% was a fourth-quarter record. The increase was primarily driven by the positive impact of supply-chain savings initiatives (principally in China). For the full year, revenues, system-sales growth and operating profit were principally driven by growth in both KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in company and franchise markets. More than 70% of the new restaurant openings were built by the company's franchise and joint-venture partners. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales declined by 0.5 percentage points for the full year. Prior to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, margin declined by 0.3 percentage points. A decline in same-store sales for company markets negatively impacted margins and was partially offset by the impact of supply-chain savings initiatives (principally in China). The favorable impact of foreign currency conversion added $7 million to operating profit for the fourth quarter and $23 million for the full year. UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ---------------------- (million, except restaurant Fourth Quarter Full Year counts and --------------------------- --------------------------- percentages) 2003 2002 Incr/(Decr) 2003 2002 Incr/(Decr) ------------------------------------------------------- Financial Measures Revenues $1,738 $1,691 +3% $5,655 $5,347 +6% Operating Profit $241 $240 +1% $812 $802 +1% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Metrics System Restaurants 18,666 18,860 (1)% 18,666 18,860 (1)% Multibrand Restaurants 2,148 1,817 +18% 2,148 1,817 18% Systemwide Same-Store- Sales Growth +1% +1% NM Even +4% NM In the fourth quarter, continued development of new, higher-volume restaurants and positive same-store sales were the primary drivers of revenue growth. For the full year, the Long John Silver's/A&W acquisition drove revenue growth of 4%. Excluding the effect of the Long John Silver's/A&W acquisition, revenue growth of 2% was primarily driven by new-restaurant development. System restaurants decreased slightly due primarily to closures of certain lower-volume A&W single-brand mall units and Pizza Hut dine-in restaurants. The U.S. restaurant portfolio continues to be upgraded with new, higher-volume restaurants, on average, many of which are multibrand. Revenue growth attributed to the benefit of opening new restaurants with higher volumes than those restaurants that were closed was one and two percentage points respectively for the fourth quarter and the full year. Operating profit was positively impacted by these same revenue factors and lower franchise and license expenses partially offset by lower margin. In the fourth quarter, U.S. restaurant margin declined 0.5 percentage points versus the prior year, driven by higher commodity and occupancy expenses. Higher costs for beef and cheese were partially offset by a lower cost for chicken during the quarter. Occupancy costs increased, primarily due to the amendment of two Long John Silver's sale/lease-back agreements that were previously accounted for as financings now being accounted for as operating leases. As a result of these amendments, the payments made under these agreements that were previously recorded primarily as interest expense are now recorded as rent expense. For the full year, restaurant margins declined 1.4 percentage points versus 2002 primarily from increased occupancy expenses due to higher rent, including the item previously discussed, and higher utilities. Additional factors were unprofitable discounting and unfavorable product mix at both KFC and Pizza Hut, and sales deleverage at KFC. Sales deleverage occurs when inflation in restaurant costs is not offset by increases in same-store sales. WORLDWIDE NEW-RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT - ------------------------------------ System New-Restaurant Openings Full Year ----------------- Worldwide 1,498 Key Markets Franchise-Only International Markets 401 United States 390 China 268 U.K. 106 Australia/New Zealand 71 South Korea 47 Mexico 44 System new-restaurant openings for the full year were primarily driven by growth in new international KFCs and Pizza Huts in the key international markets noted in the preceding table. Franchise and joint-venture partners opened over 70% of systemwide new international restaurants for the full year. Restaurant counts increased 27% in China, 9% in Mexico, 8% in the U.K. and 2% in Korea versus the end of fourth-quarter 2002. In key franchise markets year-over-year restaurant growth was 14% in Asia, 5% in Caribbean/Latin America, 4% in the Middle East and 4% in South Africa. In the U.S. market, the majority of new-restaurant openings were KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants. Over 60% of the U.S. new-restaurant openings were franchised. KFC new-restaurant openings were almost 70% multibrand restaurants. Virtually all the Pizza Hut new-restaurant openings were delivery/carry-out restaurants. This discussion excludes changes in license-unit locations, which are expected to have no material impact on the company's overall profit performance in 2004. License locations are typically nontraditional sites, such as airports, that normally have substantially lower average unit volumes than traditional restaurant locations. MULTIBRANDING EXPANSION - ----------------------- Fourth Quarter Multibrand Restaurants in Operation 2003 2002 Incr/(Decr) ------ ------ ----------- U.S. Systemwide 2,148 1,817 +18% % U.S. System Restaurants 12% 10% +2 ppts In the fourth quarter, 148 multibrand restaurants were added in the U.S., bringing the total to 382 U.S. multibrand additions for the full year. Of the 382 U.S. multibrand additions in 2003, 58% were conversions of existing single-brand restaurants, including 9% that were rebuilds on existing sites. The remaining 42% were new-restaurant openings of which 12% were relocations -- building a new restaurant in place of an older restaurant nearby. At year-end 2003, more than 50% of the 2,148 U.S. multibrand restaurants were franchised. Increasingly, the company's multibrand focus will be on combining two core brands -- Taco Bell and KFC -- with the recently acquired brands -- Long John Silver's and A&W. Additionally, Pizza Hut will expand testing of multibrand combinations with the newly created brand WingStreet. These various combinations represented 64% of the multibrand additions in 2003. The company expects this percentage to increase in 2004. FRANCHISE GROWTH AND FEES - ------------------------- Fourth Quarter Full Year --------------- --------- Franchise Net New-Restaurant Growth +1% +1% Total Franchise Fees ($ million) $297 $939 Growth Vs. 2002 +9% +9% International markets contributing to the worldwide net expansion of new franchise restaurants were Asia, the Middle East, South Africa and Caribbean/Latin America. In the U.S. market, the KFC and Long John Silver's brands both had net positive franchise expansion. For the fourth quarter, favorable foreign currency conversion added 3 percentage points of franchise-fee growth. Excluding this factor, franchise fees increased 6%. This growth was primarily driven by new-restaurant development, worldwide franchise same-store-sales growth of 2% and increased international royalty rates. For the full year, favorable foreign currency conversion and the Long John Silver's/A&W acquisition added 3 percentage points and 1 percentage point of franchise-fee growth respectively. Excluding these factors, franchise fees increased 5%. This growth was primarily driven by new-restaurant development, increased international royalty rates and worldwide franchise same-store-sales growth of 1%. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Worldwide general and administrative (G&A) expenses increased $25 million, or 8%, in the fourth quarter including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency conversion. The increase was primarily driven by increases associated with international restaurant expansion and pension expense. Worldwide G&A expenses increased $32 million, or 3%, for the full year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency conversion and the full-year impact of the Long John Silver's/A&W acquisition, G&A expenses were even with 2002. Lower management incentive costs were offset by increases in expenses associated with international restaurant expansion and pension expense. CASH-FLOW For the fourth quarter and year to date, the company more than funded capital spending with net cash provided by operating activities. Additional cash was generated from employee stock-option proceeds, proceeds from refranchising restaurants and sales of property, plant and equipment. The company expects these trends to continue for 2004. For 2003, as a result of all cash generated after capital spending, the company was able to continue reducing its debt balance by over $300 million and repurchased $278 million of its own shares as indicated in the attached Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. FIRST-QUARTER 2004 OUTLOOK The company is comfortable with the current consensus estimate of $0.43 in EPS prior to special items in the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared to last year's performance. Additionally, the company expects a net special-items gain of approximately $0.02 primarily related to additional recoveries from the AmeriServe bankruptcy estate. It is our expectation that this will substantially complete the company's AmeriServe recoveries. ANNUAL OUTLOOK The company expects earnings per share to grow at least 10% each year with the continued execution of its three key strategies: (1) steady improvement in operations, (2) profitable international expansion and (3) multibranding category-leading brands. Projected factors contributing to the company's annual EPS expectations were published in the company's December 4, 2003, press release. All those specific expectations remain reasonable based on current information. The company now expects a net special-items gain for the year as noted in the following table. Annual Outlook Forecast Actual 2004 2003 Incr/(Decr) -------- ------- ----------- EPS prior to Special Items $2.27 $2.06 +10% Special Items EPS $0.02 $(0.04) NM Reported EPS $2.29 $2.02 +13% In several Asian markets, including Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and certain sections of China, avian flu has impacted retail sales trends and the company's sales trends at KFC. Based on information currently available, the company believes that the most likely effect of avian flu outbreaks in these markets will be short term and is reflected in the company's current annual and first-quarter outlooks previously noted. Additionally, the company currently does not expect that the avian flu outbreak will materially affect its chicken supply in Asia or other markets. Nevertheless, we want our shareholders to know that if, hypothetically, the avian flu outbreak affects the entire country of China for approximately one to two months with sales declines in the range of 20% at KFC, full-year EPS results for the company would be unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.01 to $0.02. Based on current trends in the total Yum! portfolio, the company believes it can offset any possible shortfall and maintain the $2.27 per share earnings estimate prior to special items for 2004. As always, the company will continue to update shareholders each four-week period on current sales trends worldwide. CONFERENCE CALL Yum!

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. Special items include the GAAP income statement captions of Wrench litigation, AmeriServe and other charges (credits) and the Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax. These amounts are described in (d), (e) and (f) in the accompanying notes. The Company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations.

(b) Facility actions included the following: Quarter Year to date ------------------- ------------------- 12/27/03 12/28/02 12/27/03 12/28/02 --------- --------- --------- --------- Store closure costs $8 $(2) $6 $15 Asset impairment charges 21 12 34 36 Refranchising net loss (gain) (17) (10) (4) (19) --------- --------- --------- --------- Facility actions $12 $- $36 $32 ========= ========= ========= ========= Throughout 2003, store closure costs and asset impairment charges were previously included in Other (income) expense. (c) Other (income) expense primarily includes equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. (d) The amounts recorded as Wrench litigation for the year to date ended December 27, 2003 reflect the legal judgment against Taco Bell Corp. on June 4, 2003 in Wrench v. Taco Bell Corp. and related interest. Interest recorded on the yet to be paid judgment was not material in the quarter ended December 27, 2003. (e) The amount recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the quarter and year to date ended December 27, 2003 primarily resulted from recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. Amounts recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the quarter and year to date ended December 28, 2002, which were referred to as unusual items in 2002, primarily resulted from recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, partially offset by integration costs related to the acquisition of Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. and, for the full-year 2002, costs to defend certain wage and hour litigation. (f) Effective December 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. As a result of obligations under certain leases that are within the scope of SFAS 143, the Company has recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2 million ($1 million after tax). The adoption of SFAS 143 did not materially affect the results of our operations for the quarter or year to date ended December 27, 2003, nor do we anticipate that it will materially affect the results of operations in future periods.
