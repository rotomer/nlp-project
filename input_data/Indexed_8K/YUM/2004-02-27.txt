FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
(c)     Exhibits 99      Press release dated February 26, 2004 from Yum! Brands, Inc.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
YUM! BRANDS, INC. REPORTS PERIOD 2 SALES FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. BUSINESSES; CONFIRMS 2004 EPS GUIDANCE OF AT LEAST $2.27 PRIOR TO SPECIAL ITEMS, $2.29 INCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS
- Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported estimated International system sales increased 6% prior to foreign currency conversion or 15% after conversion to U.S. dollars. Estimated U.S. blended same-store sales at company restaurants increased 5% during the four-week period ended February 21, 2004 (Period 2).
Louisville, Ky. - February 26, 2004
International System Sales Growth (Estimated)
As noted on February 11, 2004, in the company's fourth-quarter 2003 earning release, sales in several Asian markets, including sections of China, have been impacted by the avian-flu situation. The company continues to believe, based on information currently available, that the most likely effect of the avian-flu situation in Asia will be short term in nature, which is reflected in the guidance previously provided. As previously communicated, the international business period close is one period prior to the company's period-end date to facilitate worldwide consolidated reporting. Therefore, the impact of the avian-flu situation in Asia will be seen in Period 4 sales results.
U.S. Company Same-Store Sales Growth (Estimated)
KFC same-store-sales results in Period 1 were unfavorably impacted versus a year ago by one to two percentage points due to the Super Bowl, a high sales day for the brand, occurring in Period 2 this year versus Period 1 last year. This has positively impacted KFC's Period 2, 2004, results by a similar amount.
The company's guidance remains unchanged. For the full year 2004, the company expects EPS of at least $2.27 prior to special items or at least $2.29 including a special-items net gain.
Sales results for Period 3 (the four-week period ending March 20, 2004, for the U.S. businesses) will be released Thursday, March 25, 2004.
include only company restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. blended same-store sales include KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell company-owned restaurants only. U.S. same-store sales for Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants are not included. U.S. franchise and systemwide same-store-sales results are reported quarterly within the company's earnings release and include only KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Restaurants.
U.S. same-store sales
includes total sales from all international restaurants regardless of ownership, including company-owned, franchise, license, and joint-venture restaurants. Currently there are more than 12,000 international system restaurants in more than 100 countries and territories outside the United States. Sales of international franchise, joint-venture and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, joint-venture and license restaurant sales are not included in the company sales we present on our Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with U.S. GAAP; however, the fees are included in the company's revenues. We believe international system-sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of our company's market share relative to competitors and the overall strength of our brands in the market place. The international business period close is one period prior to the company's period-end date to facilitate consolidated reporting. Please refer to the reporting calendar posted on Yum!
