Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports First-Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.47, an Increase of 21% LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 21, 2004--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported results for the first-quarter ended March 20, 2004. -- Raises full-year 2004 EPS guidance $0.03 to at least $2.30 prior to special items, an increase of 12%, and reported EPS to at least $2.32. -- Reports Period 4 estimated international system sales increased 12% in U.S. dollar terms or 3% prior to U.S. dollar conversion. The company estimates the avian-flu situation in Asia adversely impacted Period 4 results by approximately 5 to 6 percentage points prior to U.S. dollar conversion; currently, sales in all affected Asian markets, including China, have recovered. -- Reports Period 4 estimated U.S. blended same-store sales at company restaurants increased 1% (Taco Bell, +6%; Pizza Hut, +3%; KFC, -7%); excluding the timing impact of the Easter holiday weekend, U.S. blended same-store sales at company restaurants increased 2%. Key points relative to first-quarter 2004 performance versus first-quarter 2003: -- International operating profit grew 36%. -- International system restaurants in operation expanded by 5%, the 15th consecutive quarter of at least 5% year-over-year growth. -- Growth of system restaurants in operation was +25% in China; +8% in the U.K.; +6% in international franchise-only markets. -- U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation expanded by 19%. -- U.S. blended systemwide same-store sales increased 4%. -- Worldwide restaurant margin increased 0.6 percentage points to 14.7%. -- Higher U.S. commodity costs adversely impacted U.S. restaurant margin by approximately 0.6 percentage points. -- The company repurchased $216 million of its own shares. Consolidated Financial Highlights First Quarter ---------------------------- 2004 2003 % Change -------- -------- -------- System Restaurants 30,886 30,468 +1 Systemwide Same-Store-Sales Growth +3% (1)% NM Revenues ($ million) $1,970 $1,802 +9 Reported EPS $0.47 $0.39 +21 David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said: "I am pleased to report we are raising our full-year 2004 estimate to at least $2.30 or 12% growth prior to special items. This reflects our confidence that we will once again exceed our 10% annual EPS growth target. Our estimate includes the impact of increased commodity inflation in the U.S., which has minimal effect on our largest and fastest growing division, Yum! Restaurants International. In fact, international profits grew 36%, and system sales grew by 8% in local currency for the first quarter, and we anticipate once again opening at least 1,000 new system restaurants outside the U.S. this year. "In the U.S., Taco Bell continues to generate strong, positive same-store-sales results driven by product news and steady operations improvement. Pizza Hut results were driven by the successful introduction of the innovative 4forAll(TM) Pizza. As expected, KFC's sales performance continues to be negative. However, we expect positive same-store-sales growth in the second half of the year as KFC executes a major brand relaunch including the roll out of a new menu board, new advertising campaign and new products. "It is also important to note that while second-quarter international system-sales growth will be adversely affected by the avian flu, China sales trends have fully recovered, and we expect this key market will continue to report rapid growth in 2004. "Shareholders should continue to expect us to execute against the unique growth opportunities that make us anything but an ordinary restaurant company: profitable international expansion, steady improvement in operations, and multibranding category-leading brands." INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - ---------------------- First Quarter ------------------------------------ (million, except restaurant Incr/(Decr) counts and percentages) ------------------------------------ 2004 2003 Reported Excl F/x ------------------------------------ Financial Measures Revenues $673 $550 +22% +14% Operating Profit $130 $95 +36% +28% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Metrics Est. System-Sales Growth +18% +8% System Restaurants 12,286 11,658 +5% NM A key growth driver for this business segment is profitable new-restaurant expansion. In the first quarter, continued expansion of our key international brands -- KFC and Pizza Hut -- and positive system same-store-sales growth drove international revenue, system-sales and operating-profit growth. First-quarter international system-sales growth prior to foreign currency conversion was 8%. Overall, system restaurants in operation grew 5%, a significant contributing factor to this performance. Our two most important markets, China and the U.K., increased system sales in local currency terms by 40% and 10% respectively. Growth of system restaurants in operation of 25% in China and 8% in the U.K. were key factors. The company's international franchise-only markets, representing 34% of international system restaurants, had 10% growth in system sales prior to currency conversion and 6% growth of system restaurants in operation. Other markets contributing positively to overall system-sales growth prior to foreign currency conversion included Australia and Korea. Performance in Mexico, Canada, and Japan had an adverse impact to overall international system-sales growth. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased 0.7 percentage points prior to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.3 percentage points. The increase was primarily driven by same-store-sales growth and the addition of new restaurants with above-average margins, principally in China. The increase was partially offset by the company operating Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in Canada that were previously owned by the Canada joint venture, which negatively impacted international restaurant margin by 0.9 percentage points. For the balance of the year, the company expects the adverse effect on margin of foreign currency translation and the dissolution of the Canada joint venture will continue to negatively impact international restaurant margin. Overall, foreign currency conversion added $8 million to operating profit. UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ---------------------- First Quarter (million, except restaurant -------------------------------- counts and percentages) 2004 2003 Incr/(Decr) -------------------------------- Financial Measures Revenues $1,297 $1,252 +4% Operating Profit $172 $163 +6% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Metrics System Restaurants 18,600 18,810 (1)% Multibrand Restaurants 2,221 1,869 +19% Systemwide Same-Store-Sales Growth +4% (2)% NM In the first quarter, the primary drivers of revenue growth were higher same-store sales and continued development of new, higher-volume restaurants, which, on average, more than offset reduced revenues and profits associated with the closure of lower-volume restaurants. System restaurants declined by one percent due primarily to closures of Pizza Hut dine-in restaurants and certain lower-volume A&W single-brand mall restaurants. The U.S. restaurant portfolio continues to be upgraded with new restaurants, which, on average, are higher volume, and many are multibrand. Opening new restaurants with higher volumes than those restaurants that were closed contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth. U.S. restaurant margin increased 0.6 percentage points versus the prior year, driven by positive same-store sales partially offset by higher occupancy and commodity (primarily cheese and beef) costs. Occupancy costs increased, primarily due to higher utility costs and the amendment of two Long John Silver's sale/lease-back agreements that were previously accounted for as financings now being accounted for as operating leases. As a result of these amendments in the third quarter of 2003, the payments made under these agreements that were previously recorded primarily as interest expense are now recorded as rent expense. WORLDWIDE NEW-RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT - ------------------------------------ System New-Restaurant Openings First Quarter ------------------- Worldwide 280 Key Markets United States 81 International Franchise-Only Markets 77 China 74 Australia/New Zealand 11 U.K. 8 Mexico 7 South Korea 3 System new-restaurant openings for the first quarter were primarily driven by growth in new international KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in the key international markets noted in the preceding table. Franchise and joint-venture partners opened more than 70% of systemwide new international restaurants for the first quarter. In key markets with a company operations presence, restaurant counts increased 25% in China, 8% in the U.K., 8% in Mexico and 2% in Korea versus the end of first-quarter 2003. In franchise-only markets, year-over-year restaurant growth was 6%, specifically, Asia, 9%; southern Africa, 6%; the Middle East, 5%; and Caribbean/Latin America, 4%. In the U.S. market, the majority of new-restaurant openings were KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants. Over 60% of the U.S. new-restaurant openings were franchised. KFC new-restaurant openings were approximately 60% multibrand restaurants. This discussion excludes changes in license-unit locations, which are expected to have no material impact on the company's overall profit performance in 2004. License locations are typically nontraditional sites, such as airports, that normally have substantially lower average unit volumes than traditional restaurant locations. MULTIBRANDING EXPANSION - ----------------------- First Quarter Multibrand Restaurants in 2004 2003 Incr/(Decr) Operation ------ ------ -------------- U.S. Systemwide 2,221 1,869 +19% % U.S. System Restaurants 12% 10% +2 ppts In the first quarter, 91 multibrand restaurants were added in the U.S., bringing the total to 2,221 U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation at the end of the first quarter. Of the 91 U.S. multibrand additions, 53% were conversions of existing single-brand restaurants including 9% that were rebuilds on existing sites. The remaining 47% were new-restaurant openings including 13% that were relocations -- building a new restaurant in place of an older restaurant nearby. More than 50% of the 2,221 U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation at the end of the first quarter were franchised. In the U.S., the company's principal multibrand focus will combine Long John Silver's with A&W, Taco Bell or KFC. Additional multibrand combinations will include KFC with A&W. Pizza Hut will expand testing of multibrand combinations in delivery/carry-out restaurants with the newly created brand WingStreet. FRANCHISE GROWTH AND FEES - ------------------------- First Quarter ----------- Franchise Net New-Restaurant Growth +1% Total Franchise Fees ($ million) $223 Growth Vs. 2003 +9% International markets contributing to +5% growth of international franchise restaurants were Asia, southern Africa, the Middle East and Caribbean/Latin America. In the U.S. market, overall franchise restaurants declined 1%. For the first quarter, favorable foreign currency conversion added 4 percentage points of franchise-fee growth. Excluding this factor, franchise fees increased 5%. This growth was primarily driven by international new-restaurant development and worldwide franchise same-store-sales growth of 3%. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Worldwide general and administrative (G&A) expenses increased $30 million, or 14%, in the first quarter prior to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency conversion of $4 million. The company incurred approximately $7 million of one-time charges related to the impairment of corporate assets and increased reserves related to potential development sites. The increase was also partially attributed to approximately $3 million associated with the company operating restaurants in Canada that were previously owned by our Canada joint venture. Other factors contributing to the increase include costs associated with the implementation of new financial and human-resource systems, increased compensation-related costs including pension and costs associated with international expansion. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE Following the unexpected death of Arthur Ho, the principal of our Yan Can joint-venture, the company decided to dissolve this partnership. The company plans to liquidate the business. The financial impact of the dissolution was not material and is included in unallocated other income (expense). CASH-FLOW In the first quarter, the company generated $189 million in net cash provided by operating activities, spent capital of $103 million and repurchased $216 million of its own shares. Additional cash was generated from employee stock-option proceeds, proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and refranchising restaurants. SECOND-QUARTER 2004 OUTLOOK The company is comfortable with the current consensus estimate of $0.52 in EPS prior to special items in the second quarter. In several Asian markets, avian flu impacted the company's sales trends at KFC. Sales in all these Asian markets, including China, have recovered. It is important to note that the short-term adverse impact of the avian-flu situation in Asia will be reflected in second-quarter results (primarily in Period 4 with some continued impact in Period 5). The company estimates the avian-flu situation negatively impacted Period 4 international system-sales results by 5 to 6 percentage points prior to foreign currency conversion. The company estimates the negative impact of the avian-flu situation to Period 5 international system sales will be approximately 2 percentage points prior to foreign currency conversion. As previously indicated, the international period close is one period prior to the company's period-end date to facilitate worldwide consolidated reporting. The company has incorporated the impact of the avian-flu situation in its annual EPS guidance of at least $2.30 before special items. Additionally, the company expects to receive recoveries from the AmeriServe bankruptcy estate that will result in a second-quarter net special-items gain of $0.02 per share. It is our expectation that this will substantially complete the company's AmeriServe recoveries. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK The company expects earnings per share to grow at least 10% each year with the continued execution of its three key strategies: (1) profitable international expansion, (2) steady improvement in operations and (3) multibranding category-leading brands. Based on first-quarter results and information currently available, including the short-term impact of the avian-flu situation and higher commodity prices, the company expects full-year EPS of $2.30 prior to special items. As always, the company will continue to update shareholders each four-week period on current sales trends worldwide. Projected factors contributing to the company's annual 2004 EPS guidance were published in the company's December 4, 2003, press release when the company presented its full-year EPS forecast for 2004 of at least $2.23 prior to special items. Based on current information, the company believes that those factors remain reasonable, except that the company now expects 2004 EPS of at least $2.30 prior to special items, which incorporates the following updated factors: -- Worldwide revenue growth of +6% to +7%: International, +13% to +14%; U.S., +2% to +3%. -- Franchise fees will exceed $1 billion, growth of +7% to +8%. -- International restaurant margin will be adversely affected by 0.5 percentage points versus 2003 due to the full-year impact of the company now operating restaurants in Canada. -- General and administrative expenses will increase approximately $50 million or 5% versus 2003. This forecast includes the impact of the company now operating restaurants in Canada and the foreign-currency-conversion impact for the full year. -- Interest expense will be down approximately $20 to $25 million versus 2003. -- A benefit of approximately $25 million from foreign currency conversion on operating profit. -- Average shares outstanding to be in a range of 304 to 307 million. For 2004, the company currently expects reported EPS of at least $2.32 including a special-items gain of approximately $0.02 per share. Annual Outlook Forecast Actual 2004 2003 Incr/(Decr) --------- ---------- ------------ EPS prior to Special Items $2.30 $2.06 +12% Special Items EPS $0.02 $(0.04) NM Reported EPS $2.32 $2.02 +15% PERIOD 4 SALES Period 4 estimated international system sales increased 3% prior to foreign currency conversion or 12% after conversion to U.S. dollars. Estimated U.S. blended same-store sales at company restaurants increased 1% versus last year for the comparable four-week period ended April 17, 2004 (Period 4). INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM Sales Growth (Estimated) - --------------------------------------------- Prior-Year Reported (U.S.$) Local Currency Basis Local Currency Basis ---------------- -------------------- --------------------- Period 4 +12% +3% +5% The company estimates the avian-flu situation in several Asian markets negatively impacted Period 4 international system-sales results by 5 to 6 percentage points prior to foreign currency conversion. The company estimates the negative impact of the avian-flu situation to Period 5 international system sales will be approximately 2 percentage points prior to foreign currency conversion. The timing of the Chinese New Year in 2004 negatively impacted Period 4 international system-sales results by approximately 1 percentage point versus 2003. As previously communicated, this positively impacted Period 3 international system-sales results by a similar amount. U.S. Company Same-Store-Sales Growth (Estimated) - ------------------------------------------------ Period 4 2004 Period 4 2003 ------------------ ------------------ U.S. BLENDED +1% +1% Taco Bell +6% +1% Pizza Hut +3% (3)% KFC (7)% +6% The timing of the Easter holiday weekend in 2004 negatively impacted Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Period 4 results by approximately 2 percentage points each versus 2003. This will positively impact Period 5 results by a similar amount. CONFERENCE CALL Yum!

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. Special items include the GAAP income statement captions of Wrench litigation, AmeriServe and other charges (credits) and, in 2003, the Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax. These amounts are described in (d), (e) and (f) in the accompanying notes. The Company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations.

(b) Facility actions included the following: Quarter ----------------- 3/20/04 3/22/03 -------- -------- Store closure costs $- $- Asset impairment charges 1 2 Refranchising net loss (gain) 8 7 -------- -------- Facility actions $9 $9 ======== ======== In the previous year's reporting of results for the quarter ended March 22, 2003, store closure costs and asset impairment charges were included in other (income) expense. (c) Other (income) expense primarily includes equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. (d) An insignificant amount of expense was recorded for the quarter ended March 20, 2004 reflecting interest related to the yet to be paid judgment against Taco Bell Corp. on June 4, 2003, in Wrench v. Taco Bell Corp. Our total recorded liability for this judgment, including interest, at March 20, 2004 was approximately $42 million. (e) Amounts recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) were not significant for the quarters ended March 20, 2004 and March 22, 2003. (f) Effective December 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. As a result of obligations under certain leases that are within the scope of SFAS 143, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2 million ($1 million after tax). (g) In the quarter ended March 20, 2004, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $36 per share. YUM! Brands, Inc.
