Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports Second-Quarter Earnings Per Share, EPS, of $0.55, an Increase of 16% Prior to Special Items.

Novak, Chairman and CEO, said: "I am pleased to report we are raising our full-year 2004 EPS estimate to at least $2.33, or +13% growth. This reflects our confidence that our largest and fastest growing division, Yum! Restaurants International, will continue its strong momentum, and that we will grow U.S. blended same-store sales at least 2% for the balance of the year. The underlying strength of our global base business is allowing us to offset significant commodity inflation in the U.S. and, once again, exceed our annual target of at least 10% growth in EPS. "We were able to meet our operating earnings forecast for the second quarter solely on the solid performance of our global portfolio and exceed our EPS forecast due to a lower-than-expected tax rate. "Given our substantial cash flow and investment-grade rated balance sheet, we were pleased to announce the initiation of the company's first dividend in its history. Payable August 6, 2004, our first dividend checks of $0.10 per share will soon be sent to shareholders. "Shareholders should continue to expect us to execute against the unique growth opportunities that make us anything but an ordinary restaurant company: profitable international expansion, steady improvement in operations, and multibranding category-leading brands." INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - ---------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year to Date (million, % Change % Change except unit ------------- ------------- counts and Excl Excl percentages) 2004 2003 Reported F/x 2004 2003 Reported F/x ------ ------ -------- ---- ------ ------ -------- ---- Financial Measures Revenues $728 $608 +20 +14 $1,401 $1,158 +21 +14 Operating Profit $109 $88 +23 +14 $239 $183 +30 +21 Operating Metrics Est. System- Sales Growth +15 +7 +16 +7 System Restaurants 12,330 11,749 +5 NM 12,330 11,749 +5 NM - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A key growth driver for this business segment is profitable new-restaurant expansion. In the second quarter and year to date, continued expansion of our international brands -- KFC and Pizza Hut -- drove international revenue, system-sales and operating-profit growth. System same-store sales were slightly positive for the second quarter and year to date despite the avian-flu situation in Asia earlier in the second quarter. Second-quarter international system-sales growth prior to foreign currency conversion of 7% was equal to the ongoing target for growth in this measure. Overall, system restaurants in operation grew 5%, a significant contributing factor to this performance. Our two most profitable markets, China and the U.K., increased system sales in local currency terms by 19% and 7% respectively. System restaurants in operation increased 26% in China and 8% in the U.K. The company's international franchise-only businesses, representing 34% of international system restaurants, had 12% growth in system sales prior to currency conversion and 5% growth of system restaurants in operation. This is a key segment in terms of high-return growth within the company's international business. Other markets contributing positively to overall system-sales growth prior to foreign currency conversion included Pizza Hut South Korea, Mexico and developing markets in Europe for KFC. Performance in Canada and Japan had an adverse impact on overall international system-sales growth. Second-quarter restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased 0.3 percentage points. This increase was primarily driven by modest productivity gains in all restaurant cost categories as well as positive same-store-sales growth. Year-to-date restaurant margin of 15.3% increased 0.6 percentage points prior to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.2 percentage points. Positive same-store-sales growth was the key factor as well as modest productivity gains. Overall, foreign currency conversion added $8 million to international operating profit for the second quarter and $16 million year to date. UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ----------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year to Date (million, except unit counts and percentages) 2004 2003 % Change 2004 2003 % Change ------ ------ -------- ------ ------ -------- Financial Measures Revenues $1,349 $1,328 +2 $2,646 $2,580 +3 Operating Profit $199 $204 (3) $371 $367 +1 Operating Metrics Est. System-Sales Growth +3% +6% NM +4% +6% NM System Restaurants 18,545 18,797 (1) 18,545 18,797 (1) - --------------------------------------------------------------------- In the second quarter and for the year to date, the primary drivers of U.S. revenue growth were higher systemwide same-store sales and continued development of new, higher-volume restaurants, which, on average, more than offset reduced revenues associated with the closure of lower-volume restaurants. Opening new restaurants with higher volumes than those restaurants that were closed contributed one percentage point of revenue growth in the second quarter and year to date. U.S. system restaurants declined by 1% due primarily to closures of certain Pizza Hut dine-in restaurants and lower-volume A&W single-brand mall-location restaurants. The U.S. restaurant portfolio continues to be upgraded with new restaurants, which, on average, are higher volume. For Taco Bell, KFC and Long John Silver's, many new restaurants are multibrand. For the second quarter, U.S. restaurant margin declined by 0.5 percentage points versus the prior year mainly as a result of much higher commodity costs (primarily cheese and meats). This was a key factor in the operating profit decline for the second quarter and equated to more than 2 percentage points adverse impact on restaurant margin. The company expects continued above-average inflation rates in key commodities in the U.S. for the third quarter and the full year. This is reflected in the company's outlook for these periods. WORLDWIDE NEW-RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT - ------------------------------------ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- System New-Restaurant Openings Second Quarter Year to Date -------------- ------------ Worldwide 257 537 Key Markets United States 91 172 International Franchise-Only Businesses 61 138 China 42 116 Australia/New Zealand 11 22 U.K. 14 22 Japan 14 22 Mexico 5 12 Pizza Hut South Korea 8 11 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- System new-restaurant openings for the second quarter and year to date were primarily driven by growth in new international KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants. Key international markets are noted in the preceding table. Franchise and joint-venture partners opened 73% of systemwide new international restaurants year to date. In key markets with a company operations presence, restaurant counts versus a year ago increased 26% in China, 8% in the U.K., 7% in Mexico and 7% for Pizza Hut South Korea. For international franchise-only businesses, year-over-year restaurant growth was 5%, specifically, Asia, 7%; southern Africa, 6%; the Middle East, 4%; and Caribbean/Latin America, 4%. In the U.S. market, the majority of new-restaurant openings were the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. Over 65% of year-to-date, new-restaurant openings were franchised. For Taco Bell, KFC and Long John Silver's year-to-date, more than 70% of new-restaurant openings for the system were multibrand restaurants. This discussion and the preceding table exclude changes in license-unit locations, which are expected to have no material impact on the company's overall profit performance in 2004. License locations are typically nontraditional sites, such as airports, that normally have substantially lower average unit volumes than traditional restaurant locations. MULTIBRAND EXPANSION - -------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Multibrand Restaurants in Operation Second Quarter 2004 2003 Incr/(Decr) ------ ------ ----------- U.S. Systemwide 2,375 1,917 +24% % U.S. System Restaurants 13% 10% +3 ppts. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In the second quarter, 163 multibrand restaurants were added in the U.S., bringing the year-to-date total of U.S. multibrand additions to 254. Year to date, the multibrand focus has been on expanded company testing of Pizza Hut and Wing Street multibrand combinations and expansion of the Long John Silver's brand in combination with KFC, A&W or Taco Bell in one restaurant location. Excluding the company-only expanded testing of Pizza Hut and Wing Street multibrand combinations, franchisees opened over 55% of multibrand additions year to date. Nearly 50% of the 2,375 U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation at the end of the second quarter were franchised. In the U.S., the company's principal multibrand focus will combine Long John Silver's with A&W, Taco Bell or KFC, operating two brands in one restaurant location. Additional multibrand combinations will include KFC with A&W. Pizza Hut has expanded the testing of multibrand combinations in delivery/carry-out restaurants with the newly created brand WingStreet. FRANCHISE GROWTH AND FEES - ------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year to Date -------------- ------------ Franchise Net New-Restaurant Growth +1% +1% Total Franchise Fees ($ million) $231 $454 Growth Vs. 2003 +9% +9% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- For the second quarter, favorable foreign currency conversion added 3 percentage points of franchise-fee growth. Excluding this factor, franchise fees increased 6%. Second-quarter and year-to-date growth was primarily driven by international franchise new-restaurant development and worldwide franchise same-store-sales growth. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Worldwide general and administrative (G&A) expenses increased $23 million, or 12%, in the second quarter prior to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency conversion of $3 million. The increase was partially attributed to approximately $2 million associated with the company operating restaurants in Canada that were previously owned by our Canada joint venture. Other factors contributing to the increase include costs associated with increased compensation (pension and incentives), international expansion and the implementation of new financial and human-resource systems. These were key factors in the year-to-date increase in worldwide general and administrative expenses as well. FACILITY ACTIONS Expenses related to restaurant closures and impairment and refranchising gains/losses increased $4 million for the quarter and year to date. This included losses for upcoming refranchising transactions. TAX RATE The tax rate prior to special items of 26.2% was 6.1 percentage points lower than last year's second-quarter rate due to settlements in connection with closure of regular audit cycles, a permanent rate change in one of our international markets and other items. The lower tax rate for the second quarter added $0.03 to EPS based on comparing this quarter's actual rate to the full-year tax rate forecast range included in the company's press release on December 4, 2003. The company now expects the full-year 2004 tax rate, prior to special items, will be in a range of 29% to 30%, slightly lower than in 2003. CASH-FLOW Year to date, the company generated $390 million in net cash provided by operating activities. Capital spending, including the acquisition of franchise restaurants, was $226 million. Additional cash of over $130 million was generated from employee stock-option proceeds, proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and refranchising restaurants. Year to date, $294 million of cash was used to repurchase the company's stock. We have already invested more cash in share repurchases in the first half of 2004 than we invested in any prior fiscal year. THIRD-QUARTER 2004 OUTLOOK The company is comfortable with the current consensus estimate of $0.60 in EPS prior to special items in the third quarter. Including all factors, U.S. restaurant margin is expected to decline by approximately 1 percentage point versus last year's third quarter. The company expects the largest single factor contributing to the decline to be above-average inflation in U.S. commodity costs (meats, cheese, oil) to the extent of more than 2 percentage points of margin. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK The company expects earnings per share to grow at least 10% each year with the continued execution of its three key strategies: (1) profitable international expansion, (2) steady improvement in operations and (3) multibranding category-leading brands. Based on year-to-date results and information currently available, the company expects full-year EPS of at least $2.33 prior to special items. As always, the company will continue to update shareholders each four-week period on current sales trends worldwide and provide an update to full-year EPS expectations if there are any material changes. Projected factors contributing to the company's original annual 2004 EPS guidance were published in the company's release on December 4, 2003, and updates were published with first-quarter earnings on April 21, 2004. Based on current information, the company believes that those factors remain reasonable, except that the company now expects 2004 EPS of at least $2.33 prior to special items, which incorporates year-to-date results and the following updated full-year factors: -- International revenue growth of +15% to +17%. -- International operating profit growth of at least +18% in U.S. dollar terms. -- U.S. blended same-store-sales growth in a range of +2% to +3%. -- U.S. restaurant margin for 2004 will be adversely affected by substantially higher commodity costs resulting in a year-over-year decline of about 0.5 percentage points. -- Interest expense will be down approximately $30 to $35 million versus 2003. -- Effective tax rate of 29% to 30%, slightly lower than 2003's rate. This rate is prior to special items. For 2004, the company currently expects reported EPS of at least $2.36 including a special-items gain of approximately $0.03 per share. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual Outlook ---------------------------- Forecast Actual 2004 2003 Incr/(Decr) -------- ------- ----------- EPS prior to Special Items $2.33 $2.06 +13% Special Items EPS $0.03 $(0.04) NM Reported EPS $2.36 $2.02 +17% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERIOD 7 SALES Period 7 estimated international system sales increased 14% prior to foreign currency conversion or 17% after conversion to U.S. dollars.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. Special items include the GAAP income statement captions of Wrench litigation, AmeriServe and other charges (credits) and, in 2003, the Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax. These amounts are described in (e), (f) and (g) in the accompanying notes. The Company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations.

(b) Franchisee sales represents the combined estimated sales of unconsolidated affiliate, franchise and license restaurants. Franchisee sales, which are not included in the Company sales we present on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, generate franchise and license fees (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales) that are included in the Company's revenues.

(d) Other (income) expense primarily includes equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. (e) An insignificant amount of expense was recorded as Wrench litigation for the quarter and year to date ended June 12, 2004 reflecting interest related to the yet to be paid legal judgment against Taco Bell Corp. on June 4, 2003 in Wrench v. Taco Bell Corp. Our total recorded liability for this judgment, including interest, at June 12, 2004 was approximately $42 million. (f) The amounts recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the quarter and year to date ended June 12, 2004, primarily resulted from recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. The amounts recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the quarter and year to date ended June 14, 2003, primarily included integration costs related to our acquisition of Yorkshire Global Restaurants. (g) Effective December 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. As a result of obligations under certain leases that are within the scope of SFAS 143, the Company has recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2 million ($1 million after tax). (h) We participate in various advertising cooperatives with our franchisees and licensees. In certain of these cooperatives we possess majority voting rights, and thus control the cooperatives. We have previously included the related assets and liabilities of those advertising cooperatives we control in accounts and notes receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and other current liabilities, as appropriate, on a gross basis. We have now summed all assets and liabilities of these advertising cooperatives and reported the amounts as advertising cooperative assets, restricted and advertising cooperative liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet for June 12, 2004. We have reclassified those amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 27, 2003 for comparative purposes. (i) For the quarter and year to date ended June 12, 2004, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares and 8.1 million shares of our Common Stock, respectively, at an average price of $38 per share and $36 per share, respectively.
