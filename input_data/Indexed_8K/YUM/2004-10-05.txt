Novak, Chairman and CEO, said: "I am pleased to report we are raising our full-year 2004 EPS estimate to $2.35, or 14% growth prior to special items. The underlying strength of our China and international businesses coupled with continued strong same-store-sales growth at Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is allowing us, once again, to exceed our annual target of at least 10% growth in EPS. We are especially pleased to achieve these results as we make major G&A investments to support future growth opportunities and at the same time offset significant inflation in U.S. commodities. Once again, this demonstrates the power of our global portfolio of businesses. "Looking ahead to 2005, we are confident of continuing to deliver our stated goal of at least 10% growth in EPS. This reflects our confidence that we will again open at least 1,000 new international restaurants and grow U.S. same-store sales at our target rate of 1% to 2%. "Shareholders should expect us to continue to build value by executing the unique growth opportunities that make us anything but an ordinary restaurant company: profitable international expansion, steady improvement in operations, and multibranding category-leading brands." INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - ---------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Quarter Year to Date (million, % Change % Change except unit ------------- ------------- counts and Reported Excl Reported Excl percentages) 2004 2003 F/x 2004 2003 F/x ------- ------- -------- ---- ------ ------ -------- ---- Financial Measures Revenues $810 $652 +24 +21 $2,211 $1,810 +22 +17 Operating Profit $143 $114 +25 +21 $382 $297 +28 +22 Operating Metrics Est. System- Sales Growth +16 +12 +16 +9 System Restaurants 12,448 11,845 +5 NM 12,448 11,845 +5 NM - ------------ ------ ------- -------- ---- ------ ------ -------- ---- In the third quarter and year to date, continued profitable expansion of our international brands -- KFC and Pizza Hut -- drove international revenue, system-sales and operating-profit growth. Third-quarter international system sales grew by 12% prior to foreign currency conversion, exceeding the company's ongoing target for growth with same-store-sales growth the most significant contributing factor. An additional contributor to this strong performance was the company's 5% growth in overall system restaurants. Our two most profitable markets, China and the U.K., increased system sales in local currency terms by 35% and 9% respectively. System restaurants in operation increased 27% in China and 7% in the U.K. The company's international franchise-only businesses, a high-return growth segment representing 35% of international system restaurants, had 13% growth in system sales prior to currency conversion and 6% growth of system restaurants in operation. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased 1.1 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points for the third quarter and year to date respectively. This increase was primarily driven by leverage from same-store-sales growth in company markets. Overall, foreign currency conversion added $5 million to international operating profit for the third quarter and $20 million year to date. UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ---------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Quarter Year to Date (million, except unit counts and percentages) 2004 2003 % Change 2004 2003 % Change ------- ------- --------- ------- ------- --------- Financial Measures Revenues $1,369 $1,337 +2 $4,015 $3,917 +3 Operating Profit $196 $204 (5) $567 $571 (1) Operating Metrics Est. System-Sales Growth +4% Even NM +4% +4% NM System Restaurants 18,495 18,753 (1) 18,495 18,753 (1) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In the third quarter and for the year to date, the primary drivers of U.S. revenue growth were higher systemwide same-store-sales growth and continued development of new, higher-volume restaurants that, on average, more than offset reduced revenues associated with the closure of lower-volume restaurants. Opening new restaurants with higher volumes than those restaurants that were closed contributed one percentage point of revenue growth in the third quarter and year to date. U.S. system restaurants in operation declined by 1% due primarily to closures of certain Pizza Hut dine-in restaurants and lower-volume A&W single-brand mall-location restaurants. The U.S. restaurant portfolio continues to be upgraded with new restaurants that, on average, are higher volume. For the third quarter and year to date, U.S. restaurant margin declined by 0.7 and 0.2 percentage points respectively. This decline is a result of much higher commodity costs (primarily meats and cheese), which were partially offset by same-store-sales growth. This was the primary factor in the operating profit decline for the third quarter and equated to approximately 2 percentage points adverse impact on restaurant margin. The company expects continued above-average inflation rates for key commodities in the U.S. for the fourth quarter. This is reflected in the company's outlook for the fourth quarter. WORLDWIDE NEW-RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT - ------------------------------------ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- System New-Restaurant Openings Third Quarter Year to Date -------------- ------------- Worldwide 292 829 Key Markets United States 76 248 International Franchise-Only Businesses 89 227 China 66 182 U.K. 19 41 Australia/New Zealand 13 35 Japan 11 33 Pizza Hut South Korea 7 18 Mexico 4 16 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- System new-restaurant openings for the third quarter and year to date were primarily driven by growth in new international KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants. Franchise and joint-venture partners opened 72% of systemwide new international restaurants year to date. In key markets with a company operations presence, restaurant counts versus a year ago increased 27% in China, 7% in the U.K., 6% in Mexico and 8% for Pizza Hut South Korea. For international franchise-only businesses, year-over-year restaurant growth was 6%. Specifically, Asia increased 8%; southern Africa, 6%; the Middle East, 5%; and Caribbean/Latin America, 4%. In the U.S. market, the majority of new-restaurant openings were the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. Over 65% of year-to-date, new-restaurant openings were franchised. This discussion and the preceding table exclude changes in license-unit locations, which are expected to have no material impact on the company's overall profit performance in 2004. License locations are typically nontraditional sites, such as airports, that normally have substantially lower average unit volumes than traditional restaurant locations. MULTIBRAND EXPANSION - -------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Multibrand Restaurants in Operation Third Quarter 2004 2003 Incr/(Decr) ------ ------ ----------- U.S. Systemwide 2,484 2,018 +23% % U.S. System Restaurants 13% 11% +2 ppts. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In the third quarter, 129 multibrand restaurants were added in the U.S., bringing the year-to-date total of U.S. multibrand additions to 383. Year to date, the multibrand focus has been on expanded company testing of Pizza Hut and WingStreet, a brand recently created by Yum! Brands, and expansion of the Long John Silver's brand in combination with A&W, Taco Bell or KFC in one restaurant location. Excluding the company-only expanded testing of Pizza Hut and WingStreet multibrand combinations, franchisees opened over 60% of multibrand additions year to date. In the U.S., the company's principal multibrand focus will combine Long John Silver's with A&W or Taco Bell, operating two brands in one restaurant location. In addition, Pizza Hut has expanded the testing of multibrand combinations in delivery/carry-out restaurants with WingStreet. FRANCHISE GROWTH AND FEES - ------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Quarter Year to Date ------------- ------------- Franchise Net New-Restaurant Growth +1% +1% Total Franchise Fees ($ million) $244 $698 Growth Vs. 2003 +9% +9% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- For the third quarter, favorable foreign currency conversion added 2 percentage points of franchise-fee growth. Excluding this factor, franchise fees increased 7%. Third-quarter and year-to-date growth was primarily driven by worldwide franchise same-store-sales growth and international franchise new-restaurant development. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Worldwide general and administrative (G&A) expenses increased $38 million, or 18%, in the third quarter. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the company operating restaurants in Canada that were previously owned by our Canada joint venture. This was approximately $3 million. Factors contributing to the increase include costs associated with investments in strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets. Additional costs include increased compensation-related expenses such as higher pension costs, increased surplus facility costs, and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency conversion. These were also key factors in the year-to-date increase in worldwide general and administrative expenses. CASH FLOW Year to date, the company generated $791 million in net cash provided by operating activities. Capital spending, including the acquisition of franchise restaurants, was $421 million. Additional cash of $173 million was generated from employee stock-option proceeds, proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, and refranchising restaurants. FOURTH-QUARTER 2004 OUTLOOK The company currently estimates that it will achieve EPS of $0.72 prior to special items in the fourth quarter. Including all factors, U.S. restaurant margin is expected to decrease by approximately 0.5 percentage points versus last year's fourth quarter. Inflation in U.S. commodity costs (meats and cheese) is expected to drive a margin decline of approximately 1.5 percentage points. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK The company expects earnings per share to grow at least 10% each year with the continued execution of its three key strategies: (1) profitable international expansion, (2) steady improvement in operations and (3) multibranding category-leading brands. Based on year-to-date results and information currently available, the company expects full-year EPS of at least $2.35 prior to special items. As always, the company will continue to update shareholders each four-week period on current sales trends worldwide and provide an update to full-year EPS expectations if there are any material changes. Projected factors contributing to the company's original annual 2004 EPS guidance were published in the company's release dated December 4, 2003, and updates were published with its first-quarter release dated April 21, 2004, and second-quarter release dated July 13, 2004. Based on current information, the company believes that those factors remain reasonable, and are updated by the following full-year factors: -- General and administrative expenses will increase at least $95 million or 10% versus 2003. Excluding the impact of foreign currency conversion and change in ownership of our Canadian business, G&A expenses will increase approximately $75 million or 8% versus last year. -- Reported worldwide system-sales growth of +7% to +8%; at least +8% in local currency for international. -- U.S. blended same-store-sales growth is expected to be in a range of +3% to +4%. -- U.S. operating profit approximately flat versus prior year primarily due to much higher inflation in commodities. -- International revenue growth of +18% to +20%; worldwide +7% to +8%. -- International reported operating profit growth of at least +20%. -- International restaurant margin expected to be slightly favorable versus prior year. -- Average shares outstanding to be in the range of 304 to 305 million. For 2004, the company currently expects reported EPS of at least $2.38 including a special-items gain of approximately $0.03 per share. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual Outlook ---------------------------- Forecast Actual 2004 2003 Incr/(Decr) -------- ------- ----------- EPS prior to Special Items $2.35 $2.06 +14% Special Items EPS $0.03 $(0.04) NM Reported EPS $2.38 $2.02 +18% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERIOD 10 SALES Period 10 estimated international system sales increased 8% prior to foreign currency conversion or 13% after conversion to U.S. dollars.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. Special items include the GAAP income statement captions of Wrench litigation, AmeriServe and other charges (credits) and the Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax. These amounts are described in (e), (f) and (g) in the accompanying notes. The Company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations.

(b) Franchisee sales represents the combined estimated sales of unconsolidated affiliate, franchise and license restaurants. Franchisee sales, which are not included in the Company sales we present on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, generate franchise and license fees (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales) that are included in the Company's revenues.

(d) Other (income) expense primarily includes equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. (e) An insignificant amount of expense was recorded for the quarter and year to date ended September 4, 2004 reflecting interest related to the yet to be paid legal judgment against Taco Bell Corp. on June 4, 2003, in Wrench v. Taco Bell Corp. (f) An insignificant amount was recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the quarter ended September 4, 2004. Income of $14 million was recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the year to date ended September 4, 2004. The amount primarily resulted from cash recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. (g) Effective December 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. As a result of obligations under certain leases that are within the scope of SFAS 143, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2 million ($1 million after tax) during 2003. (h) We participate in various advertising cooperatives with our franchisees and licensees. In certain of these cooperatives we possess majority voting rights, and thus control the cooperatives. We have previously reported the related assets and liabilities of those advertising cooperatives we control in accounts and notes receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and other current liabilities, as appropriate. We have now summed all assets and liabilities of these advertising cooperatives and reported the amounts as advertising cooperative assets, restricted and advertising cooperative liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 4, 2004. We have reclassified those amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 27, 2003 for comparative purposes. (i) For the quarter ended September 4, 2004, we purchased an insignificant amount of shares of our Common Stock. For the year to date ended September 4, 2004, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares of our Common Stock at an average price of $36. YUM! Brands, Inc.
