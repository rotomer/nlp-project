Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
On November 15, 2004, YUM! Brands, Inc. voluntarily redeemed all of its 7.45% senior notes due in May, 2005 (the "Notes") in accordance with the original terms of the Notes. The Notes, which had a total principal amount of $350 million, were redeemed for an amount of approximately $358 million using primarily cash on hand as well as some borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The redemption amount approximated the carrying value of the Notes resulting in no significant impact on earnings. The ongoing impact on interest expense and earnings per share was factored into the company's forecast and guidance provided in our earnings release dated October 5, 2004.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
