EXHIBIT 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. to Host Annual Conference for Investors and Analysts LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 2, 2004--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE:YUM) Additionally, the company - -- Confirms 14% growth in 2004 earnings per share (EPS) before special items of $2.35; reported EPS of $2.38. -- Expects at least 10% growth in 2005 EPS before special items to at least $2.59. -- Reports Period 12 estimated international system sales increased 12% in U.S. dollars or 8% prior to conversion to U.S. dollars. -- Reports Period 12 estimated U.S. blended same-store sales at company restaurants increased +1% versus last year (Taco Bell, +5%; Pizza Hut, +3%; KFC, -7%). Yum! Brands Inc. will host an Annual Conference for Investors and Analysts Tuesday, December 7, 2004, in New York. (See additional details about the conference at the end of this release.) The company will present comprehensive updates on its business strategies and discuss its financial growth outlook for the next three years. "The theme of our meeting is to continue to demonstrate that Yum! Brands is not your ordinary restaurant company. Importantly, we look forward to sharing the significant progress we have made executing each of our three key strategies: running great restaurants, continuing profitable international growth and multibranding great brands. Given the dramatic growth and absolute profit level we have achieved in China, we will also provide for the first time total China business and unit-level economics. Investors will see the excellent progress we are making in executing our strategy in China to build dominant brands in every significant restaurant category. "Over the long term, we are confident we can continue to grow EPS at least 10% each year by executing our unique strategies and maintaining our financial focus and discipline. For 2004, we expect to grow EPS 14%. While the fourth quarter is very challenging, our EPS expectation remains $0.72 per share since we have achieved higher-than-expected international sales growth to balance lower-than-expected U.S. sales. U.S. food costs are surprisingly higher than anticipated, primarily produce and cheese. Due to favorable international tax planning, our fourth-quarter tax rate will be better than expected, which is about 3 percentage points below last year," said David Novak, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Full-Year 2004 Forecast For full-year 2004, the company confirms earnings expectations of 14% growth in earnings per share or $2.35 before special items and reported EPS of $2.38. Full-Year 2005 Forecast For 2005, the company expects at least 10% EPS growth before special items or at least $2.59 per share. Please note: Beginning with Period 1, 2005, results of the company's China Division, which includes People's Republic of China, Thailand and KFC Taiwan, will be reported separately from the international business results. The international business, excluding the China Division, will be reported as International Division. For 2005, the company will report fiscal-year results based on 53 weeks versus a normal 52-week year. This additional week normally occurs every five years. The company expects: -- EPS of at least $2.59 or at least 10% growth in EPS before special items, inclusive of the 53rd week. The impact of the 53rd week adds a potential incremental benefit of $0.04 EPS for the year. However, the company plans to spend back against this once-every-five-year benefit with specific one-time strategic actions. These are one-time investments relating to asset actions and refranchising KFC U.S. restaurants. -- Worldwide system-sales growth of +5% to +6%, which includes about 1 percentage-point benefit from the 53rd week; International Division system-sales growth of at least +5% (local currency basis); China Division system-sales growth of at least +22%, and U.S. system-sales growth of +3% to +4%. -- Worldwide revenue growth of +5% to +6%, which includes about 1 percentage-point benefit from the 53rd week: China Division, +20%, and U.S., +3% to +4%. International Division revenue is expected to increase +5% to +6% prior to the impact of refranchising the Puerto Rico market. The impact of refranchising the Puerto Rico market this past October will result in a decline in reported revenue of about (1)%. -- U.S. blended same-store-sales growth at company restaurants in a range of +1% to +2%. -- Over 1,450 new system restaurants to be opened worldwide: -- At least 725 new International Division restaurants -- At least 375 new China Division restaurants -- At least 350 new U.S. restaurants -- International Division net-restaurant expansion to be at least +3%. -- The U.S. restaurant base to be even with 2004. -- Five hundred fifty (550) multibrand restaurant additions (gross) for the U.S. system, including conversions of existing restaurants, rebuilds, and new builds. -- Continued growth in franchise fees of +6% to +7% resulting from worldwide restaurant expansion and same-store-sales growth, which includes about 1 percentage-point benefit from the 53rd week. The growth in franchise fees includes the benefit of +1 percentage point from refranchising the Puerto Rico market in 2004. Refranchising during 2005, as it occurs, will add further growth. Historically, worldwide franchise fees have grown +8% per year on average since 1998 as a result of worldwide restaurant expansion, same-store-sales growth, and the impact of refranchising. -- Worldwide restaurant margin slightly favorable versus 2004. International Division margin is expected to increase slightly versus 2004; China Division margin is expected to be even versus 2004, and U.S. margin is expected to increase slightly. -- General and administrative costs (G&A) will increase versus 2004 by approximately +2% to +3% including the impact from the 53rd week and increased China spending to support brand expansion. Franchise and license expense will increase $5 to $6 million. -- Interest expense will increase slightly from 2004. -- Facility actions to include $60 to $65 million of closure and impairment charges, an increase of $20 million versus 2004. Refranchising gains are expected to be about even with the 2004 full-year forecast of about $10 million. -- For planning purposes, we are currently assuming no impact from foreign currency conversion on operating profit for the full year, as foreign currency exchange rates are volatile. As always, we will update you each quarter relative to the impact of foreign currency conversion. The Chinese renminbi, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Korean won, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and European euro are important currencies in the company's international business. -- Effective tax rate of 28% to 30%. -- Average shares outstanding to be in a range of 295 to 300 million shares, less than the expected average 305 million shares in 2004. -- Return on invested capital to remain at about 18%. -- Capital expenditures, including franchise restaurant acquisitions, to be about $780 million, which is about even with the level expected for 2004. Pretax refranchising and surplus PP&E proceeds are expected to increase to $180 million resulting in net capital spending of $600 million being invested in the business. -- Note: The 53rd week primarily benefits the U.S. business. The China market is a monthly reporting business with no 53rd week impact. Many International Division markets are also monthly reporting businesses, with no 53rd week benefit. Additionally, in the U.S., the timing of the KFC business closing will be accelerated by one week in December 2005, eliminating any 53rd week benefit for this business. This will align all three major U.S. brands' fiscal closings. During 2005, the company will provide additional annual guidance for these preceding items only when there is a material change to the full-year expectations previously noted. Otherwise these expectations for full-year 2005 will remain in effect. 2005 First-Quarter Forecast For the first quarter 2005, the company is expecting EPS of at least $0.49 or at least 6% growth versus first-quarter 2004. No special items affecting reported EPS are currently expected for the first quarter. Higher commodity costs are expected to impact first-quarter growth, and the effect of higher commodity costs is expected to moderate after that point in time. In the 2004 fourth-quarter earnings release scheduled for February 1, 2005, we will provide updates on the 2005 first quarter and subsequent quarters. Period 12 Sales Period 12 estimated International system sales increased 8% prior to foreign currency conversion or 12% after conversion to U.S. dollars. Estimated U.S. blended same-store sales at company restaurants were +1% versus last year for the comparable four-week period ended November 27, 2004 (Period 12).

Notes and Definitions for Terms Used in This Document U.S. same-store sales include only company restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. blended same-store sales include KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell company-owned restaurants only. U.S. same-store sales for Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants are not included.

System-Sales Growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership including unconsolidated affiliates, company-owned, franchise and license restaurants. Sales of unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), franchise and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), franchise and license restaurant sales are not included in company sales we present on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise fees are included in the company's revenues.
