Exhibit 99.1
     Employee directors do not receive additional compensation for serving on the Board of Directors. Each director who is not an employee of Yum receives an annual stock grant retainer with a fair market value of $100,000 and an annual grant of vested options to buy $125,000 worth of Yum common stock at a price equal to its fair market value on the date of grant. Directors may elect to receive up to one-half of their stock retainer in cash. Non-employee directors also receive a one-time stock grant with a fair market value of $25,000 on the date of grant upon joining the Board, distribution of which is deferred until termination from the Board. Directors may also defer payment of their retainers pursuant to the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferrals may not be made for less than one year. Yum also pays the premiums on directors' and officers' liability and business travel accident insurance policies. In recognition of the added duties of these chairs, the Chairperson of the Audit Committee receives an additional $15,000 stock retainer annually and the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee receives an additional $5,000 stock retainer annually.
