Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports Record Earnings Per Share, EPS, in 2004 of $2.36, an Increase of 15% Prior to Special Items; Reported EPS Including Special Items Was $2.42, an Increase of 20% LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 1, 2005--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM): -- Announces record fourth-quarter EPS of $0.73, an increase of 13% prior to special items. -- Increases full-year 2005 EPS guidance by $0.01 to at least $2.60 prior to special items. -- Reports estimated Period 1 International Division (excludes China Division) system sales increased 13% in U.S. dollar terms or 8% prior to foreign currency conversion. -- Reports estimated Period 1 U.S. blended same-store sales at company restaurants increased 3% (Taco Bell, +3%; Pizza Hut, +6%; KFC, +1%). Yum! Brands Inc. today reported results for the fourth quarter ended December 25, 2004. The following are key points relative to the current fourth quarter and year-over-year performance: -- Total international operating profit grew 13% or 8% prior to foreign currency conversion. -- Total international system restaurants in operation at quarter's end increased by 5%, the eighteenth consecutive quarter of at least 5%, year-over-year growth. -- International system restaurants in operation at quarter's end grew 28% in China, 6% in the U.K. and 5% in international franchise-only businesses. -- U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation expanded by 23%. -- Systemwide U.S. blended same-store sales increased 2%. -- U.S. restaurant margin declined 2.1 percentage points primarily due to significantly higher commodity costs. -- The tax rate prior to special items declined 4.4 percentage points to 24.1%. This boosted fourth-quarter EPS by one cent beyond what was indicated in the company's prior guidance calling for a 3 percentage point decline. -- Fourth-quarter results included two cents of cost from accounting adjustments related to the current and prior years' impact of a change in interpretation related to accounting for leases and leasehold improvements. -- The company paid a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share November 5, 2004. Consolidated Financial Highlights Fourth Quarter Full Year --------------------------------------------------- 2004 2003 % Change 2004 2003 % Change ------- ------- --------- ------- ------- --------- System Restaurants 31,263 30,837 +1 31,263 30,837 +1 Worldwide System Same-Store-Sales Growth +2% +2% NM +3% Even NM Revenues (million) $2,785 $2,653 +5 $9,011 $8,380 +8 EPS Prior to Special Items $0.73 $0.65 +13 $2.36 $2.06 +15 Special Items EPS $0.04 $0.05 NM $0.06 $(0.04) NM Reported EPS $0.77 $0.70 +10 $2.42 $2.02 +20 David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said: "I am pleased to report 2004 was another year in which we showed the underlying power of our global portfolio of leading restaurant brands. Fueled by continued profitable international expansion including dynamic growth in China, combined with another strong performance from Taco Bell in the United States, we achieved 15% EPS growth prior to special items. Additionally, executing our financial strategies and increasing our cash flow contributed to our strong performance -- our third consecutive year of solid double-digit growth in EPS. "Highlights include a number of firsts: record cash generated from operating activities of over $1.1 billion and a record $1.0 billion in franchise fees. We also reached our goal to achieve an investment grade rating from each major rating agency after paying off nearly $3 billion in debt the past seven years. Armed with increasing cash flow and a strong balance sheet, we also increased our payout to shareholders by initiating the first quarterly dividend in our history and completing the buyback of a record 14 million shares, spending approximately $569 million. "Most importantly, we remain confident that going forward we can continue to build our track record of growing EPS at least 10% each year. As we have said, the key drivers are opening at least 1,000 new restaurants outside the U.S.A., and growing U.S. same-store sales by +1% to +2%. As we move into the new year, given the strength of our fourth-quarter performance, we have raised our full-year 2005 EPS estimate one cent to at least $2.60 or at least 10% growth prior to special items. "Shareholders should expect us to continue to build value by executing the unique growth opportunities that differentiate us from the competition and make us anything but an ordinary restaurant company: building dominant restaurant brands in China, driving profitable international expansion, improving restaurant operations, and multibranding category-leading brands." INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS - ---------------------- Fourth Quarter Full Year (million, % Change % Change except unit ------------- ------------- counts and Excl Excl percentages) 2004 2003 Reported F/x 2004 2003 Reported F/x ------ ------ -------- ---- ------ ------ -------- ---- Financial Measures Revenues $1,037 $915 +13 +10 $3,248 $2,725 +19 +15 Operating Profit $160 $144 +13 +8 $542 $441 +23 +17 Operating Metrics Est. System- Sales Growth +13 +8 +15 +9 System Restaurants 12,792 12,171 +5 NA 12,792 12,171 +5 NA NOTE: 2004 International Business results include the China Division (the People's Republic of China, Thailand and KFC Taiwan). Starting with the first quarter of 2005, the International Division and China Division results will be reported separately. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, continued profitable expansion of KFC and Pizza Hut drove international revenue, system-sales and operating-profit growth. Fourth-quarter international system sales grew by 8% prior to foreign currency conversion, exceeding the company's ongoing target for growth with same-store-sales growth slightly above target. As has been the case for the past four years, the most significant contributor to this strong performance was growth in overall international system restaurants. Our two most profitable markets, China and the U.K., increased system sales in local currency terms by 19% and 8% respectively. The company's international franchise-only businesses, a high-return growth segment representing 35% of international system restaurants, had 9% growth in system sales prior to currency conversion and 5% growth of system restaurants. For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 10% prior to foreign currency conversion. As previously communicated, the Puerto Rico market was refranchised subsequent to the third quarter, which ended September 4, 2004. Excluding the impact of refranchising the Puerto Rico market, reported revenue growth for the fourth quarter would have been 13% prior to foreign currency conversion. With the refranchising of the Puerto Rico market, revenue from these restaurants changes from company sales to franchise fees. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales declined 0.3 percentage points for the fourth quarter. This was primarily driven by unfavorable impact from higher labor costs in certain markets and the impact of operating a portion of the Canada market, previously an unconsolidated affiliate. For the full year, restaurant margin increased 0.3 percentage points. This increase was primarily a result of positive leverage from same-store-sales growth in company markets. For 2005, we expect international restaurant margin to increase slightly. Overall, foreign currency conversion added $6 million to international operating profit for the fourth quarter and $26 million for the year. UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ---------------------- (million, except Fourth Quarter Full Year unit counts and percentages) 2004 2003 % Change 2004 2003 % Change ------- ------- --------- ------- ------- --------- Financial Measures Revenues $1,748 $1,738 Even $5,763 $5,655 +2 Operating Profit $210 $241 (13) $777 $812 (4) Operating Metrics Est. System-Sales Growth +3% +1% NM +3% Even NM System Restaurants 18,471 18,666 (1) 18,471 18,666 (1) In the fourth quarter and for the full year, the primary drivers of U.S. revenue growth were continued development of new, higher-volume restaurants, which, on average, more than offset reduced revenues associated with the closure of lower-volume restaurants and systemwide same-store-sales growth. These higher volume new restaurants contributed one percentage point of revenue growth in the fourth quarter and full year. U.S. system restaurants in operation declined by 1% due primarily to closures of certain Pizza Hut dine-in restaurants and lower-volume A&W single-brand mall-location restaurants. The U.S. restaurant portfolio continues to be upgraded with new restaurants, which on average, are higher volume. For the fourth quarter and the full year, U.S. restaurant margin declined by 2.1 and 0.8 percentage points respectively, mainly as a result of significantly higher commodity costs (primarily meats and cheese) partially offset by same-store-sales growth. This was a key factor in the operating profit decline for the fourth quarter and full year, equating to approximately 1.7 percentage points and 1.6 percentage points of adverse impact on restaurant margin respectively. The cumulative accounting adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter related to a recent change in interpretation related to accounting for leases and leasehold improvements negatively impacted restaurant margin by 0.8 and 0.2 percentage points for the fourth quarter and full year 2004 respectively. The company expects continued above-average inflation rates for key commodities in the U.S. for the first quarter of 2005. This is reflected in the company's outlook. WORLDWIDE NEW-RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT - ------------------------------------ System New-Restaurant Openings Fourth Quarter Year to Date -------------- ------------- Worldwide 621 1,450 Key Markets International Franchise-Only Businesses 182 409 United States 125 373 China 152 334 U.K. 50 91 Japan 18 51 Australia/New Zealand 14 49 Pizza Hut South Korea 30 48 Mexico 13 29 Worldwide system new-restaurant openings for the fourth quarter and full year were primarily driven by growth in new international KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants. Franchise and joint-venture partners opened 71% of systemwide new international restaurants for the full year. For international franchise-only businesses, year-over-year restaurant growth was 5%. Specifically, Asia increased 7%; southern Africa, 7%; the Middle East, 6%; Caribbean/Latin America, 5%; and Europe 1%. In the U.S. market, the majority of new-restaurant openings were the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. For the full year, over 60% of new-restaurant openings were franchised. This discussion and the preceding table exclude changes in license-unit locations, which had no material impact on the company's overall profit performance in 2004. License locations are typically nontraditional sites, such as airports, that normally have substantially lower average unit volumes than traditional restaurant locations. MULTIBRAND EXPANSION - -------------------- Multibrand Restaurants in Operation Fourth Quarter 2004 2003 Incr/(Decr) ------- ------- ----------- U.S. Systemwide 2,641 2,148 +23% % U.S. System Restaurants 14% 12% +2 ppts. In the fourth quarter, 164 multibrand restaurants were added in the U.S., bringing the full-year total of U.S. multibrand additions to 547. Multibrand focus has been on expanded company testing of Pizza Hut/WingStreet multibrand combinations and expansion of the Long John Silver's brand in combination with A&W, Taco Bell or KFC. This results in operating two brands in one restaurant location. Excluding the company-only expanded testing of Pizza Hut and WingStreet multibrand combinations, franchisees opened over 55% of multibrand additions in 2004. WingStreet is a brand recently created by Yum! Brands. FRANCHISE GROWTH AND FEES - ------------------------- Fourth Quarter Full Year -------------- -------------- Total Franchise Fees (million) $321 $1,019 Growth Vs. 2003 +8% +8% Franchise Net New-Restaurant Growth +1% +1% For the fourth quarter, favorable foreign currency conversion added 2 percentage points of franchise-fee growth. Excluding this factor, franchise fees increased 6% driven by new-unit development, same-store-sales growth and the effect of refranchising. Fourth-quarter and full-year growth was primarily driven by international franchise new-restaurant development and worldwide franchise same-store-sales growth. LEASE ACCOUNTING CHANGES A number of companies within our industry have recently announced adjustments to their accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements. These adjustments were the result of a recent change in interpretation of longstanding, generally accepted accounting principles in this area. We first reviewed this issue during the fourth quarter of 2003 to ensure that our accounting complied with the then-existing interpretation of GAAP. In recent consultation with our external auditors, we have recorded minor adjustments during the fourth quarter to conform our accounting in all instances to this evolving interpretation. Accordingly, the depreciable lives of our leasehold improvements now conform to the term of the lease, including options in some instances, over which we are recording rent expense, including escalations, on a straight-line basis. The cumulative adjustment necessary to conform our accounting to this new interpretation, primarily through increased U.S. depreciation expense, totaled $11.5 million ($7 million after tax). The portions of this adjustment that related to 2004 full year and 2004 fourth quarter were approximately $3 million ($2 million after tax) and $1 million respectively. As the adjustment was not material to any of our prior financial statements, the full adjustment was recorded in the current financial statements and no adjustment will be made to prior financial statements. We anticipate that the impact of this change will result in additional expense of $3 million in 2005. TAX RATE The company's fourth-quarter tax rate of 24.1% prior to special items was 4.4 percentage points below the rate for the 2003 fourth quarter. This boosted fourth-quarter EPS by one cent beyond what was indicated in the company's prior guidance on December 2, 2004, which called for a 3 percentage point decline. The year-over-year decline in the tax rate was primarily due to the execution of international tax-planning strategies and settlements in connection with the closure of regular audit cycles. CASH FLOW For the full year, the company generated $1,131 million in net cash provided by operating activities. Capital spending, including the acquisition of franchise restaurants, was $683 million. Additionally, a substantial amount of cash, $392 million, was generated from employee stock-option proceeds, refranchising restaurants, and proceeds from sales of surplus property, plant and equipment. In 2004, the company purchased a record $569 million of its own shares and initiated its first quarterly dividend. Additionally, the company completed an early redemption of its May 2005 bonds reducing debt over $300 million by year end. The majority of the company's remaining bond debt is due in 2011 and 2012. SPECIAL ITEMS As described in the second-quarter 2003 earnings release dated July 15, 2003, the company previously incurred a charge of $30 million related to a legal judgment at Taco Bell in connection with Wrench et al. v. Taco Bell. Subsequently, the company accrued prejudgment and post-judgment interest charges of $12 million with respect to this judgment. We have settled this matter with the Wrench plaintiffs and certain of our insurance carriers resulting in a reduction of our previous accrual by $14 million. We intend to continue to seek additional recoveries from our other insurance carriers during the periods in question and from our former advertising agency. To the extent we are successful, these recoveries will be treated as additional special-item gains in the quarter(s) recognized. Special items also include $2 million in AmeriServe recoveries during the quarter. FIRST-QUARTER 2005 OUTLOOK The company currently expects that it will achieve EPS of $0.51 prior to special items in the first quarter of 2005. Including all factors, U.S. restaurant margin is expected to decrease slightly versus last year's first quarter. Inflation in U.S. commodity costs (meats and cheese) is expected to be the key factor. The effect of higher commodity costs is expected to moderate after the first quarter of 2005. This outlook assumes a first-quarter 2005 tax rate equal to the expected effective rate for the full year 2005. Additionally, some favorable foreign exchange benefit is expected. FULL-YEAR 2005 OUTLOOK The company expects earnings per share to grow at least 10% each year with the continued execution of its four key strategies: (1) building dominant restaurant brands in China, (2) driving profitable international expansion, (3) improving restaurant operations, and (4) multibranding category-leading brands. Based on the most current information, the company expects growth of at least 10% prior to special items in EPS for 2005 to occur in this manner by quarter and assumes the same tax rate for each quarter equal to the expected effective rate for the full year 2005: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 -------- -------- -------- -------- EPS Prior to Special Items $0.51 $0.56 $0.73 $0.80 % Growth +9 +2 +20 +10 Second-quarter 2005 growth is adversely impacted by higher facility actions expense, an expected higher tax rate versus 2004, and costs associated with the company's biennial international franchise convention. Projected factors contributing to the company's original annual 2005 EPS guidance were published in the company's release dated December 2, 2004, which can be accessed at http://investors.yum.com/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=YUM&script= 400&item_id='1'. (Due to its length, this URL may need to be copied/pasted into your Internet browser's address field. Remove the extra space if one exists.) Based on current information, the company believes that those factors remain reasonable. For 2005, the company currently expects reported EPS of at least $2.60 prior to special items. Annual Outlook ------------------------------- Forecast Actual 2005 2004 Incr/(Decr) --------- --------- ----------- EPS Prior to Special Items $2.60 $2.36 +10% Special Items EPS $0.00 $0.06 NM Reported EPS $2.60 $2.42 +7% PERIOD 1 SALES Period 1 estimated International Division system sales increased 8% prior to foreign currency conversion or 13% after conversion to U.S. dollars. This excludes results of the China Division, which reports on a calendar basis rather than 13 periods.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. Special items include the GAAP income statement captions of Wrench litigation (income) expense, AmeriServe and other charges (credits) and the Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax. These amounts are described in (e), (f) and (g) in the accompanying notes. The Company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations.

(b) Franchisee sales represents the combined estimated sales of unconsolidated affiliate, franchise and license restaurants. Franchisee sales, which are not included in the Company sales we present on the Consolidated Statements of Income, generate franchise and license fees (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales) that are included in the Company's revenues.

(e) Income of $14 million was recorded as Wrench litigation (income) expense for both the quarter and year to date ended December 25, 2004. The amount resulted from settlements with the plaintiffs in the Wrench litigation and certain of our insurance carriers which allowed us to reduce amounts previously accrued. (f) Income of $2 million and $16 million was recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) for the quarter and year to date ended December 25, 2004. The amount primarily resulted from cash recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. (g) Effective December 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. As a result of obligations under certain leases that are within the scope of SFAS 143, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2 million ($1 million after tax) during 2003. (h) We participate in various advertising cooperatives with our franchisees and licensees. In certain of these cooperatives we possess majority voting rights, and thus control the cooperatives. We have previously reported the related assets and liabilities of those advertising cooperatives we control in accounts and notes receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and other current liabilities, as appropriate. We have now summed all assets and liabilities of these advertising cooperatives and reported the amounts as advertising cooperative assets, restricted and advertising cooperative liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 25, 2004. We have reclassified those amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 27, 2003 for comparative purposes. (i) For the quarter and year to date ended December 25, 2004, we repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares and 14.0 million shares of our Common Stock at an average price of $46 per share and $41 per share, respectively.
