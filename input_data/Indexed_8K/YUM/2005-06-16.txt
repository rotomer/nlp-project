Section 9 - Financial Statements and Exhibits
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits 99.1  Press Release dated June 16, 2005 from YUM! Brands, Inc.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
- Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported second-quarter system sales for its International Division increased 6% prior to foreign currency conversion or 11% after conversion to U.S. dollars. Second-quarter system sales for its China Division increased 2% versus last year. U.S. blended same-store sales at company restaurants increased 5% for the second quarter 2005.
Louisville, Ky. - June 16, 2005
The company confirms its second-quarter 2005 EPS estimate previously provided in the first-quarter earnings release dated April 20, 2005.
International Division System-Sales Growth (Estimated)
These results exclude the China Division. The company's annual target growth rate for International Division system sales is at least +5% prior to foreign currency conversion.
Note:
China Division System-Sales Growth (Estimated)
The China Division includes mainland China, Thailand, and KFC Taiwan. For the purpose of this report, like calendar months have been compared. The company's annual target growth rate for China Division system sales is at least 22% prior to foreign currency conversion.
Note:
As expected, China Division Period 6 system sales were even with last year, consistent with our previous guidance. As originally detailed in the company's sales release dated March 24, 2005, and the first-quarter earnings release dated April 20, 2005, sales at KFC restaurants in mainland China were negatively impacted by adverse publicity relating to an isolated issue with a seasoning supplier. Sales in our mainland China Pizza Hut restaurants have not been impacted.
Currently, we expect Period 7 system sales to increase 2% to 3% versus last year and sales recovery from the low point in the last week of Period 4 to continue at a slow but sure pace. The company is pursuing a partial financial recovery from its supplier in mainland China related to the ingredient issue. It is anticipated that any recovery would be included in third- and fourth-quarter 2005 results.
U.S. Company Same-Store-Sales Growth (Estimated)
The company's annual target growth rate for U.S. same-store sales is +1% to +2%.
Note:
Update on Second-Quarter EPS Forecast
The company confirms its prior EPS guidance for the second quarter. As previously communicated, we expected EPS to be $0.56 for the second quarter, excluding any possible one-time gain from an IPO of our Poland/Czech Republic joint venture. The IPO occurred April 27, 2005. Including the impact of the IPO transaction, EPS for the second quarter is expected to total $0.59 to $0.60. The transaction generated a gain of $17 million, which will be reflected in other income. As noted in our first-quarter release, the company anticipates additional facility actions expense during the year to offset this gain.
Additional information will be communicated in the company's second-quarter earnings to be released July 13, 2005.
2005 Period 6 End Dates
International Division 5/16/2005
China Division 5/31/2005
U.S. Business 6/11/2005
Period 7 Sales Release

includes all operations outside the U.S., with the exception of those reported in the China Division. Currently, the International Division includes more than 11,000 system restaurants in 100 countries and territories. The International Division's period close remains one period earlier than the company's period-end date to facilitate consolidated reporting. Please refer to the reporting calendar posted on Yum! Brands' Web site at the following URL: http://investors.yum.com/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=YUM&script=1000.
International Division
includes mainland China, Thailand, and KFC Taiwan. Based on restaurant counts at the end of the first quarter 2005, the China Division includes 1,525 restaurants in mainland China, 366 restaurants in Thailand, and 132 KFC restaurants in Taiwan.
China Division
For 2005, we have moved forward mainland China's business reporting calendar one period to more closely align the timing of reporting its results of operations with our U.S. business.
For purposes of this sales release, we have compared calendar months included in China Division's current reporting
calendar with those same months last year. However, for purposes of quarterly financial reporting, we will compare 2005 results with previously reported 2004 results. The 2004 results for mainland China reflect a lag of one period. For example, fiscal second-quarter 2005 results for mainland China will end at May 31, 2005. Last year's second-quarter results ended April 30, 2004.
includes total sales from all restaurants regardless of ownership, including company-owned, franchise, license, and unconsolidated affiliate (joint-venture) restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate (joint-venture) and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the company (typically at a royalty rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate (joint-venture) and license restaurant sales are not included in the company sales we present on our Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with U.S. GAAP; however, the royalty fees are included in the company's revenues. We believe system-sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all our revenue drivers, company and franchise same-store sales as well as new-restaurant development.
System-sales growth for our International and China businesses
include only company restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. blended same-store sales include KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell company-owned restaurants only. U.S. same-store sales for Long John Silver's and A&W restaurants are not included. U.S. systemwide same-store-sales results including franchise restaurants are reported quarterly within the company's earnings release and include only KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants.
U.S. same-store sales
