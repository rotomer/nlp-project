Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports 2005 Second-Quarter EPS of $0.62 Prior to Special Items, a 12% Increase; Reported EPS, Including a 2004 Special-Item Credit, Grew by 6% LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 13, 2005-- Increases Full-Year 2005 EPS Estimate by $0.02 Prior to Special Items to $2.62 or 11% Growth Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 11, 2005.

Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased to report the strength of the Yum! Brands' global portfolio is allowing us to raise our full-year 2005 EPS estimate to $2.62 or 11% growth. Our high-return Yum! Restaurants International Division is well on the way to another very strong year. Additionally, our China Division sales performance is much improved, and we expect to return to solid profit growth for the balance of the year. We are especially pleased with our blended U.S. same-store-sales growth led by sustained performance at Taco Bell and the continued turnaround of KFC-U.S., which has experienced eight consecutive periods of positive same-store sales. We expect the underlying strength of our global portfolio of businesses to allow us to once again exceed our annual target of at least 10% growth in EPS. "Importantly, we remain bullish on our long-term new-unit growth opportunity for both our China and Yum! Restaurants International Divisions. In fact, we are on track to reach our full-year target to open a record 375 new restaurants in our China Division and to open at least 725 new restaurants for Yum! Restaurants International Division. This will be the fifth straight year of at least 1,000 new restaurants opened outside the U.S.A., and we expect to at least maintain this pace going forward. "Shareholders should continue to expect us to remain committed to building value by executing the unique growth opportunities of our global portfolio that make us anything but an ordinary restaurant company: build dominant restaurant brands in China, drive profitable international expansion, improve U.S. restaurant operations and multibrand category-leading brands."

System-Sales Growth +11 +7 System Restaurants 10,978 10,626 +3 NM - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: These results exclude the China Division. The Q2 2005 operating profit does not include the gain of $17 million from the IPO of our Poland/Czech Republic franchise business. A key growth driver for the Yum! Restaurants International Division is continued new-restaurant openings across an array of international markets and leveraging the substantial infrastructure in place around the world. It is important to note that both second-quarter and year-to-date revenue comparisons were adversely affected by the refranchising of our Puerto Rico market in last year's fourth quarter. The transaction resulted in the sale of this company-operated market to a franchisee. Excluding the impact of the change in ownership of the Puerto Rico market, revenues increased 3% for the second quarter and 4% year to date, prior to foreign currency conversion. In the second quarter, continued new-restaurant expansion of our key international brands -- KFC and Pizza Hut -- and positive system same-store-sales growth drove International Division system-sales and operating-profit growth. New restaurants opened in the quarter totaled 126 across more than 36 different countries and territories. Year to date, 227 new restaurants were opened, 94% by our franchisees. Total new-restaurant openings for the full year are expected to be at least 725, the sixth straight year of at least 700 new-restaurant openings. Second-quarter International Division system-sales growth prior to foreign currency conversion was 6% versus our ongoing target of at least 5% growth. Overall, system restaurants in operation grew 3%. The company's international franchise-only markets led the way with 10% growth in system sales prior to currency conversion and 5% growth in system restaurants in operation. These businesses cover more than 100 countries and represent 42% of International Division's system restaurants. Other markets contributing to overall system-sales growth prior to currency conversion included the U.K., Mexico and Japan. In the U.K., a key market, system sales increased 4% prior to currency conversion, driven primarily by 7% growth in system restaurants in operation. For the second quarter, restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased 0.2 percentage points. Excluding the Puerto Rico market, restaurant margin would have increased 0.4 percentage points versus last year for the second quarter. Substantially stronger performance in Mexico was a significant positive factor for restaurant-margin performance. For the full year, excluding the impact of refranchising the Puerto Rico market, restaurant margin is expected to increase slightly versus 2004 driven primarily by strong business performance in Mexico. For the second quarter, excluding the refranchising of the Puerto Rico market, operating profit would have grown 21% prior to foreign currency conversion. Overall, foreign currency conversion added $5 million to operating profit for the second quarter and $9 million year to date. For the full year 2005, Yum! Restaurants International Division is expected to produce profit growth of at least 14% with system-sales growth of 6% in local currency terms.

System- Sales Growth (fiscal-period basis) +13 +12 +16 +16 System Restaurants 2,082 1,704 +22 NM 2,082 1,704 +22 NM - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: The China Division includes mainland China, Thailand, and KFC Taiwan. Please refer to "Notes and Definitions" at the end of this release for explanation of estimated system-sales growth. A key growth driver for the China Division is rapid new-restaurant expansion of multiple Yum! restaurant brands. In the second quarter, as originally detailed in the company's sales release dated March 24, 2005, sales at KFC restaurants in mainland China were negatively impacted by adverse publicity relating to an issue, since resolved, with a seasoning supplier beginning with results in the third week of Period 4. As a result, China Division second-quarter system sales increased 12% excluding foreign currency conversion, below our ongoing target of at least 22% growth. As indicated in the company's most recent forecast, the below-target sales resulted in a 30% decline in operating profit for the second quarter. Second-quarter restaurant margin decreased 3.3 percentage points versus the prior year, driven primarily by negative same-store-sales growth in company-operated KFC restaurants in mainland China as noted previously. Overall, system restaurants in operation grew 22%. During the second quarter, a total of 68 new restaurants opened, including 50 KFCs, 16 Pizza Huts and 2 East Dawnings. Year to date 2005, 168 new restaurants were opened with an ownership mix of 74% company, 23% joint-venture and 3% franchise restaurants. For the remainder of the year, sales trends are expected to steadily improve from the low point in Period 4, and operating-profit performance is expected to show growth versus last year. Additionally, a partial financial recovery (approximately $13 million) from our mainland China seasoning supplier will be recognized in the third quarter. We expect to recognize some additional recovery during the fourth quarter of 2005 or the first quarter of 2006. UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ---------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year to Date 2005 2004 % Change 2005 2004 % Change ------- ------- --------- ------- ------- --------- Financial Measures Revenues ($ million) $1,385 $1,349 +3 $2,720 $2,646 +3 Operating Profit ($ million) $190 $199 (4)% $352 $371 (5)% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Metrics Systemwide Same-Store-Sales Growth +3% +2% NM +3% +3% NM System Restaurants 18,374 18,545 (1)% 18,374 18,545 (1)% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A key growth driver for this business segment is same-store-sales growth. In the second quarter, the primary drivers of revenue growth were higher same-store sales and continued development of new, higher-volume restaurants, which, on average, more than offset reduced revenues associated with the closure of lower-volume restaurants. Opening new restaurants with higher volumes than those restaurants that were closed contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth. Operating profit for the second quarter declined $9 million or 4% primarily due to $10 million in higher facility-actions expense mainly at KFC-U.S. Excluding this factor, U.S. operating profit for the second quarter was slightly higher versus last year. Higher G&A expense of $6 million and commodity costs (mainly meats) of $3 million also impacted year-over-year profit comparisons. For the balance of the year, it is anticipated that U.S. operating profit will show growth prior to the impact of higher facility-action expense in the range of +6% to +8%. WORLDWIDE NEW-RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT - ------------------------------------ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- System New-Restaurant Openings Second Quarter Year to Date ---------------- ------------ Worldwide 258 527 Key Markets Mainland China 64 158 United States 64 132 International Franchise-Only Businesses 61 130 (more than 100 countries and territories) U.K. 20 31 Australia/New Zealand 8 18 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- New-restaurant development of our brands around the world is a key factor in year-to-year earnings growth for the company overall. For the International Division franchise-only businesses, new-restaurant growth versus a year ago continued across all regions: in Asia, +5%; southern Africa, +6%; the Middle East, +7%; and Caribbean/Latin America, +2%. For the 130 new openings year to date from this group of markets, 63 were new KFCs and 57 were new Pizza Huts. In the U.S. market, the majority of new-restaurant openings were by Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell franchisees. Over 75% of U.S. new-restaurant openings were franchised. Worldwide new franchise-restaurant openings are a key contributor to the company's continued above-industry-average performance of return on invested capital. Globally, our franchisees are required to fund their new-restaurant development. This discussion excludes changes in license-unit locations, which are expected to have no material impact on the company's overall profit performance in 2005. License locations are typically nontraditional sites, such as airports, that normally have substantially lower average unit volumes than traditional restaurant locations. U.S. MULTIBRANDING EXPANSION - ---------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter -------------------- Incr/ Multibrand Restaurants in Operation 2005 2004 (Decr) ------ ------ ------ U.S. Systemwide 2,813 2,375 +18% % U.S. System Restaurants 15% 13% +2 ppts - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In the second quarter, 121 multibrand restaurants were added in the United States. Of the 121 U.S. multibrand additions, 76% were conversions of existing single-brand restaurants, 15% were new-restaurant openings and 9% were relocations -- building a completely new multibrand restaurant in place of an older single-brand restaurant nearby. More than 45% of the 2,813 U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation at the end of the second quarter were franchised. For the full-year 2005, the company expects the U.S. system to add at least 550 multibrand restaurant locations, including more than 300 Pizza Hut and WingStreet combinations and more than 100 with Long John Silver's in combination with Taco Bell, KFC or A&W. FRANCHISE GROWTH AND FEES - ------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year to Date ---------------- ------------ Franchise Net New-Restaurant Growth +1% +1% Total Franchise Fees ($ million) $251 $495 Growth Vs. 2004 +9% +9% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Franchise fees experienced across-the-board growth driven by worldwide franchise new-restaurant development, refranchising (primarily the Puerto Rico market), same-store-sales growth and international royalty-rate increases. For the second quarter and year to date, favorable foreign currency conversion added 2 percentage points of franchise-fee growth. In the second quarter, worldwide franchise fees were generated primarily in the United States (58%) and the International Division (39%). The China Division contributed the remaining 3% to worldwide franchise fees. The company has more than 2,400 worldwide franchise partners including more than 1,800 in the United States, nearly 600 in the International Division and 29 in the China Division. G&A EXPENSES Worldwide G&A expenses for the second quarter were $28 million higher than last year. G&A was negatively impacted by a charge of $10 million related to the potential resolution of certain litigation matters as well as higher legal fees of $3 million associated with these matters. Additionally, the company continues to invest in the China Division infrastructure. CASH FLOW Year to date, the company generated $605 million in net cash provided by operating activities, invested capital of $210 million and repurchased $489 million of its own shares. As expected, additional cash was generated from employee stock-option proceeds, refranchising restaurants and the IPO of our Poland/Czech Republic franchise business. TAX RATE The effective tax rate prior to special items of 23.6% was 2.6 percentage points lower than last year's second-quarter rate primarily due to settlements related to the closure of regular audit cycles, partially offset by additional tax expense due to anticipated foreign earnings repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The lower tax rate for the second quarter added $0.03 to EPS versus the company's previously announced expectations. We had previously identified $110 million in expected foreign earnings repatriation in the fourth quarter of 2004 and recorded the appropriate additional tax expense that quarter. During the second quarter of 2005, the company identified additional expected repatriation of approximately $400 million. As a result, $19 million of additional tax expense was reflected in the full-year effective tax rate, $8 million of which was recorded as income tax expense in the second-quarter. This repatriation will ultimately save the company over $100 million versus normal and expected tax rates to repatriate earnings. The additional taxes of $19 million included in this year's tax rate equates to $0.06 per share on a full-year basis. STOCK-OPTION EXPENSING We are considering whether to begin options expensing, adopting SFAS123R, in either the fourth quarter of 2005 or the first quarter of 2006. We will have a final decision communicated in our third-quarter earnings release scheduled for October 4, 2005. THIRD-QUARTER AND FOURTH-QUARTER 2005 OUTLOOK The company expects EPS prior to special items of $0.70 and $0.77 for the third and fourth quarters, an increase of 15% and 5% respectively. A number of factors are expected to impact results: -- In the fourth quarter, facility-action expenses and the effective tax rate are both expected to be unfavorable versus the prior year, more than offsetting the benefit of the fifty-third week. -- The company will record a partial financial recovery of approximately $13 million from its supplier in mainland China related to the ingredient issue. This recovery will be included in third-quarter 2005 results. We expect to recognize some additional recovery during the fourth quarter of 2005 or the first quarter of 2006. -- Updates will be provided if there is a material change to these expectations. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK Each year, the company expects earnings per share to grow at least 10% with the continued execution of four key strategies: (1) build dominant restaurant brands in China, (2) profitable international expansion, (3) run great restaurants and (4) develop and expand multibranding. Based on second-quarter results year to date and information currently available, the company increased its full-year EPS expectations by $0.02 to $2.62 prior to special items. Projected factors contributing to the company's original annual 2005 EPS guidance were published in the company's release dated December 2, 2004. Based on current information, following is an update on the full year: -- Worldwide system-sales growth of +5% to +6%, which includes about 1 percentage-point benefit from the fifty-third week; International Division system-sales growth of at least +6% (local currency basis); China Division system-sales growth of +10% to +15% (local currency basis), and U.S. system-sales growth of +3% to +4%. -- Worldwide revenue growth of +4% to +5%, which includes about 1 percentage-point benefit from the fifty-third week: China Division, +10% to +15% (local currency basis), and U.S., +3% to +4%. International Division revenue is expected to increase +5% to +6% (local currency basis) prior to the impact of refranchising the Puerto Rico market. The impact of refranchising the Puerto Rico market this past October will result in a decline in reported revenue of about 1%. -- U.S. blended same-store-sales growth at company restaurants in a range of +3% to +4%. -- Continued growth in franchise fees of at least 7% resulting from worldwide restaurant expansion and same-store-sales growth, which includes about 1 percentage-point benefit from the fifty-third week. The growth in franchise fees includes the benefit of +1 percentage point from refranchising the Puerto Rico market in 2004. -- Worldwide restaurant margin is expected to be flat to slightly lower versus 2004. International Division margin is expected to be about even versus 2004; China Division margin, which was negatively impacted by sales declines caused by adverse publicity relating to an isolated issue with a seasoning supplier, is expected to be 17% to 18%, and U.S. margin is expected to increase slightly. -- General and administrative costs (G&A) will increase versus 2004 by approximately +3% prior to the impact of the fifty-third week, due to increased China spending to support brand expansion and higher charges relating to certain litigation matters. The fifty-third week adds approximately +1% for the full year. -- Interest expense will be even versus last year. -- Positive profit impact from foreign currency conversion on operating profit of $15 to $17 million, or $0.03 or $0.04, for the full year. As always, we will update you each quarter relative to the impact of foreign currency conversion. The Chinese renminbi, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Korean won, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and European euro are important currencies in the company's international business. -- Facility actions to include $60 to $65 million of closure and impairment charges, an increase of $20 million versus 2004. Refranchising gains are expected to be about even with the 2004 full-year forecast of about $10 million. The forecast could be revised upward based on additional reviews during the third quarter. -- Effective tax rate of 26% to 28%. -- The U.S. restaurant base is expected to be down slightly, about 1%, versus 2004. The following full-year factors have not been changed: -- Capital expenditures, including franchise restaurant acquisitions, to be about $720 million. Pretax refranchising and surplus PP&E proceeds are expected to total $180 million resulting in net capital spending of $540 million being invested in the business. -- Over 1,450 new system restaurants to be opened worldwide -- At least 725 new International Division restaurants -- At least 375 new China Division restaurants -- At least 350 new U.S. restaurants -- International Division net-restaurant expansion to be at least +3%. -- Five hundred fifty (550) multibrand restaurant additions (gross) for the U.S. system, including conversions of existing restaurants, rebuilds, and new builds. -- Average shares outstanding to be in a range of 295 to 300 million shares, less than the expected average 305 million shares in 2004. -- Return on invested capital to remain at about 18%. -- Note: The fifty-third week primarily benefits the U.S. business. The China market is a monthly reporting business with no fifty-third week impact. Many International Division markets are also monthly reporting businesses with no fifty-third-week benefit. Additionally, in the U.S. the timing of the KFC business closing will be accelerated by one week in December 2005 eliminating any fifty-third week benefit for this business. This will align all three major U.S. brands' fiscal closings. - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual Outlook Forecast Actual 2005 2004 Incr/(Decr) -------- ------ ----------- EPS prior to Special Items $2.62 $2.36 +11% Special Items EPS $0.00 $0.06 NM Reported EPS $2.62 $2.42 +8% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERIOD 7 SALES - -------------- INTERNATIONAL DIVISION SYSTEM-SALES GROWTH (Estimated) - ------------------------------------------------------ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2005 2005 2004 Reported (U.S. $) Local Currency Local Currency ----------------- --------------- --------------- Period 7 +10% +5% +8% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: These results exclude the China Division.

For the purpose of this sales release, like calendar months have been compared. The company's annual target growth rate for China Division system sales is at least +22% prior to foreign currency conversion. China Division Period 7 system sales increased 5% prior to foreign currency conversion versus last year. As originally detailed in the company's sales release dated March 24, 2005, sales at KFC restaurants in mainland China were negatively impacted by adverse publicity relating to an isolated issue with a seasoning supplier. Since that point in time, sales growth has continued to improve at a steady pace. Sales in our mainland China Pizza Hut restaurants were not impacted. Currently, we expect Period 8 system sales to increase at least 12% versus last year and sales recovery from the low point in the last week of Period 4 to continue. Period 8 sales growth will benefit by approximately 2 percentage points due to a shift in the number of weekend days (with higher sales) versus last year's Period 8. This impact will reverse in Period 9, resulting in a negative impact of 2 percentage points.

NOTES & DEFINITIONS FOR TERMS USED THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT - ----------------------------------------------------------- China Division system-sales growth explanation: Estimated system-sales growth differs from the 2% reported in the Period 6 sales release, which compared like calendar months. For 2005, we have moved forward the mainland China business reporting calendar one month to more closely align the timing of reporting that business's results of operations with our U.S. business. Notes: Sales results for Period 8 (the four-week period ending August 6, 2005) are scheduled to be released August 11, 2005, before market hours. Sales and profit information included in the release is rounded to the nearest million; however, percentage-point change calculations are based on numbers that are not rounded. Definitions: Excl F/x represents the percentage change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. These amounts are calculated by translating current-year results at prior-year average exchange rates. We believe elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. Franchise Fees include fees from unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures) and franchise and license restaurants. Fees include ongoing royalty and license fees, initial fees for new restaurants and contract-renewal fees. Franchise Restaurants include unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures) and franchise restaurants and exclude license restaurants. Franchise Net New-Restaurant Growth is the year-over-year total of franchise restaurant and unconsolidated affiliates (joint-venture) openings less franchise restaurant and unconsolidated affiliates (joint-venture) closings divided by the prior year's franchise and unconsolidated affiliates (joint-venture) restaurant total. New-Restaurant Openings include unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), company-owned and franchise restaurants and exclude license restaurants. Special Items include AmeriServe and other charges (credits) and Wrench litigation. System Restaurants include unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), company-owned and franchise restaurants but exclude license restaurants. System-Sales Growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership including unconsolidated affiliates, company-owned, franchise and license restaurants. Sales of unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), franchise and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), franchise and license restaurant sales are not included in company sales we present on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise fees previously defined are included in the company's revenues. We believe system-sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all our revenue drivers, company and franchise same-store sales as well as new-restaurant development. System Same-Store-Sales Growth is the estimated growth in sales of all restaurants that have been open one year or more regardless of ownership including unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), company-owned, franchise and license restaurants. Systemwide U.S. Same-Store Sales include all company, franchise and license restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. same-store sales include KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silver's and A&W restaurants. U.S. Blended Same-Store Sales include only company restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. blended same-store sales include KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell company-owned restaurants only. U.S. same-store sales for Long John Silver's and A&W restaurants are not included.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. Special items include the GAAP income statement captions of Wrench litigation (income) expense and AmeriServe and other charges (credits). These amounts are described in (f) in the accompanying notes. The Company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations.

(b) In 2005, we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management structure. The China Division includes mainland China ("China"), Thailand and KFC Taiwan, and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, segment information for previous periods has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation. (b) In 2005, we also changed the China business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our U.S. business. Previously our China business, like the rest of our international businesses, closed one month (or one period for certain of our international businesses) earlier than YUM's period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting. To maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations, net income of the China business of $6 million for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 was recognized as an adjustment to consolidated retained earnings in the year to date ended June 11, 2005, as opposed to being recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Our consolidated results of operations for the quarter and year to date ended June 11, 2005 include the results of operations of the China business for the months of March, 2005 through May, 2005 and January, 2005 through May, 2005, respectively, and the months to be included in future quarterly reporting periods will begin one month later than in previous years. Our consolidated results of operations for the quarter and year to date ended June 12, 2004 continue to include the results of operations of the China business for the months of February, 2004 through April, 2004 and December, 2003 through April, 2004, respectively. (c) Franchisee sales represents the combined estimated sales of unconsolidated affiliate, franchise and license restaurants. Franchisee sales, which are not included in the Company sales we present on the Consolidated Statements of Income, generate franchise and license fees (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales) that are included in the Company's revenues.

(f) Amounts recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) primarily result from cash recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, which were not significant for both the quarter and year to date ended June 11, 2005. There was no Wrench litigation (income) expense recorded for the quarter and year to date ended June 11, 2005. (g) For the quarter and year to date ended June 11, 2005, we repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares and 9.8 million shares of our Common Stock, respectively, at an average price of $50 per share for both the quarter and year to date.
