Consolidated Financial Highlights Third Quarter Year To Date ------------------------------------------------- 2005 2004 % Change 2005 2004 % Change ------- ------- -------- ------- ------- -------- System Restaurants 31,537 30,943 +2 31,537 30,943 +2 Revenues (million) $2,243 $2,179 +3 $6,450 $6,226 +4 EPS prior to Special Items $0.71 $0.61 +18 $1.86 $1.63 +14 Special Items EPS $0.01 $0.00 NM $0.01 $0.03 NM Reported EPS $0.72 $0.61 +18 $1.87 $1.66 +13 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased to report that based on our third-quarter results we are again raising our 2005 full-year EPS estimate, now up to $2.64 or 12% growth prior to special items. We continue to aggressively expand outside the United States and expect to exceed our full-year target of over 1,100 new restaurants. This includes a record number of new-restaurant openings from our China Division where we fully expect to exceed our 2005 target of 375 openings. We are especially pleased that our third-quarter U.S. blended same-store sales increased 4%, lapping our strongest quarter last year, which is the best performance in five years. We expect 4% U.S. blended growth for the full-year 2005. "Looking forward to 2006, we are very confident we will continue to deliver our stated annual goal of at least 10% growth in EPS. Shareholders should expect us to continue to build value by executing the unique growth opportunities that make us anything but an ordinary restaurant company: Building dominant restaurant brands in China, driving profitable international expansion, running great restaurants, and multibranding category-leading brands. In doing so, we expect to maintain our industry leading ROIC (return on invested capital) of 18%." INTERNATIONAL DIVISION - ---------------------- Third Quarter Year to Date % Change % Change ------------- -------------- Reported Excl Reported Excl 2005 2004 F/x 2005 2004 F/x ------------------------------------------------------ Financial Measures Revenues(1) ($ million) $490 $509 (4) (8) $1,466 $1,485 (1) (6) Operating Profit ($ million) $89 $79 +12 +9 $273 $241 +14 +9 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Metrics Est. System- Sales Growth +7 +4 +10 +6 System Restaurants 11,066 10,689 +4 NM 11,066 10,689 +4 NM - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Both third-quarter and year-to-date revenue comparisons were adversely affected by the refranchising of our Puerto Rico market in last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the change in ownership of the Puerto Rico market, revenues increased 1% for the third quarter and 3% year to date prior to foreign currency conversion. The transaction resulted in the sale of this company-operated market to a franchisee. A key growth driver for the Yum! Restaurants International (YRI) Division is new-restaurant openings across an array of international markets and leveraging our substantial infrastructure in place around the world. In the third quarter, continued new-restaurant expansion of KFC and Pizza Hut brands and positive system same-store-sales growth drove YRI system-sales and operating-profit growth. New restaurants opened in the quarter totaled 176. For both third-quarter and year-to-date 2005, YRI's operating profit growth outpaced revenue growth primarily due to strong performance from our highly profitable franchise-only businesses. Revenues are lower due to refranchising of the Puerto Rico market in the fouth quarter of last year and lower sales this year in key company markets: South Korea and the U.K. Operating profit for the quarter and year-to-date is up primarily due to strong franchise same-store sales and unit growth. Year to date, 93% of restaurant openings have been by our franchise and joint-venture partners. International franchise-only markets led the way with 10% growth in system sales prior to currency conversion and 5% growth in system restaurants in operation during the third quarter. These businesses represent both KFC and Pizza Hut brands and cover more than 100 countries and territories. In the U.K., a key market with 7% growth in system restaurants, system sales decreased 1% prior to currency conversion, due in part to a very weak retail environment, recently compounded by the impact of terrorist activity. Overall, Mexico was the strongest performing company market. For the third quarter, restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased 0.8 percentage points. Excluding the Puerto Rico market, restaurant margin would have decreased 0.2 percentage points versus last year. Overall, foreign currency conversion added $3 million to operating profit for the third quarter and $11 million year to date. Full-year currency impact is estimated at $12 million. For the full-year 2005, Yum! Restaurants International Division is expected to produce revenue growth of approximately +4% in local currency terms prior to the impact of refranchising the Puerto Rico market, reported profit growth of 14%, and system-sales growth of 6% in local currency terms, including at least 725 new-restaurant openings. This would be the sixth straight year of at least 700 new-restaurant openings, and we expect our franchisees to open more than 80% of the new restaurants. CHINA DIVISION - -------------- Third Quarter Year to Date % Change % Change -------------- ------------- Reported Excl Reported Excl 2005 2004 F/x 2005 2004 F/x ------------------------------------------------------ Financial Measures Revenues ($ million) $360 $301 +20 +18 $871 $726 +20 +19 Operating Profit ($ million) $85 $64 +32 +31 $163 $141 +15 +14 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Metrics Est. System- Sales Growth (fiscal-period basis) +18 +17 +17 +16 System Restaurants 2,159 1,759 +23 NM 2,159 1,759 +23 NM - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: Please refer to "Notes and Definitions" at the end of this release for explanation of estimated system-sales growth. A key growth driver for the China Division is rapid new-restaurant expansion of multiple Yum! restaurant brands. Overall, system restaurants in operation grew 23%. During the third quarter, a total of 84 new restaurants opened, including 73 KFCs and 11 Pizza Huts. Operating profit for the third quarter benefited by $14 million of financial recovery from a major supplier, and we expect to recognize an additional meaningful financial recovery from the same supplier during the fourth quarter of 2005. Additionally, due to a fiscal-reporting calendar shift, third-quarter operating profit increased by $6 million. Conversely, this shift negatively impacts the fourth quarter by a similar amount. Third-quarter restaurant margin decreased 1.6 percentage points versus the prior year, driven primarily by negative same-store sales in company-operated KFC restaurants in mainland China. Foreign currency conversion added $1 million to operating profit for the third quarter and $2 million year to date. Full-year currency impact is estimated at $3 million. For the full-year 2005, the China Division in local currency terms is expected to produce system-sales growth of at least 15%, revenue growth in the range of 17% and profit growth of approximately 10%, and at least 375 new-restaurant openings (approximately 75% of new restaurants are company owned, and 25% are joint venture and franchise). UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ---------------------- Third Quarter Year to Date 2005 2004 % Change 2005 2004 % Change ------- ------- -------- ------- ------- --------- Financial Measures Revenues ($ million) $1,393 $1,369 +2 $4,113 $4,015 +2 Operating Profit ($ million) $189 $196 (4) $541 $567 (5) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Metrics Systemwide Same-Store-Sales Growth % +4 +3 NM +4 +3 NM System Restaurants 18,312 18,495 (1) 18,312 18,495 (1) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A key growth driver for this business segment is positive same-store-sales growth. In the third quarter, the primary drivers of revenue growth were higher same-store sales and continued development of new, higher-volume restaurants, partially offset by 2 percentage points negative impact from refranchising. When company restaurants are refranchised, revenue from these restaurants changes from company sales to franchise fees, reducing the company's reported revenue. Operating profit increased 5% for the third quarter excluding the impact of higher facility action expenses primarily related to restaurant closures at KFC and Long John Silver's and one-time costs associated with Hurricane Katrina. For the fourth quarter, it is anticipated that U.S. operating profit will show growth of about 5% prior to the impact of higher facility action expenses and the benefit of the fifty-third week. This includes the adverse impact of an incremental $4 to $6 million from expected higher energy costs and lost profits related to closed restaurants as a result of Hurricane Katrina. For the full-year 2005, U.S. operating profit and restaurant margin are expected to be flat versus prior year. WORLDWIDE NEW-RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT - ------------------------------------ System New-Restaurant Openings Third Quarter Year to Date -------------- ------------ Worldwide 347 874 Key Markets International Franchise-Only Businesses (more than 100 countries and territories) 107 237 Mainland China 77 235 United States 87 219 U.K. 19 50 Australia/New Zealand 7 25 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- New-restaurant development of our brands around the world is a key factor in year-to-year earnings growth for the company overall. For the International Division franchise-only businesses, new-restaurant growth versus a year ago continued across all regions: in Asia, +6%; southern Africa, +7%; the Middle East, +7%; and Caribbean/Latin America, +3%. For the 237 new openings year to date from this group of markets, 119 were new KFCs and 93 were new Pizza Huts. In the U.S. market, the majority of new-restaurant openings were by Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell franchisees. Year to date, over 73% of U.S. new-restaurant openings were franchised. U.S. MULTIBRANDING EXPANSION - ---------------------------- Third Quarter -------------------------- Incr/ Multibrand Restaurants in Operation 2005 2004 (Decr) -------- -------- -------- U.S. Systemwide 2,918 2,484 +17% % U.S. System Restaurants 16 13 +3 ppts - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In the third quarter, of the 100 U.S. multibrand additions, 67% were conversions of existing single-brand restaurants (primarily Pizza Hut/WingStreet), 24% were new-restaurant openings and 9% were a new multibrand restaurant in place of a closed single-brand restaurant nearby. For the full-year 2005, the company expects the U.S. system to add at least 550 multibrand restaurant locations. FRANCHISE GROWTH AND FEES - ------------------------- Third Quarter Year to Date ------------- ------------- Franchise Net New-Restaurant Growth +1% +1% Total Franchise Fees ($ million) $268 $763 Growth Vs. 2004 +10% +9% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Franchise fees experienced across-the-board growth driven by worldwide franchise new-restaurant development, refranchising (primarily the Puerto Rico market) and same-store-sales growth. For the third quarter and year to date, favorable foreign currency conversion added 1 percentage point of franchise-fee growth. In the third quarter, worldwide franchise fees were generated primarily in the United States (58%) and the International Division (38%). The China Division contributed the remaining 4% to worldwide franchise fees. The company has more than 2,400 worldwide franchise partners including more than 800 in the United States, nearly 600 in the International Division and 29 in the China Division CASH FLOW Year to date, the company generated $1,041 million in net cash provided by operating activities, invested capital of $362 million and repurchased $678 million of its own shares. We expect full-year capital spending to be about $650 million versus the prior forecast of $720 million. Additionally, we now expect full-year share repurchases to total at least $800 million. STOCK-OPTION EXPENSING We will begin expensing all stock-based compensation, adopting SFAS123R retroactively to the beginning of 2005, in fourth-quarter 2005. Thus, our 2005 results will reflect a full-year impact of the adoption of SFAS123R. We currently estimate the impact of the adoption will reduce full-year and fourth-quarter EPS by $0.12 and $0.04 respectively. FOURTH-QUARTER 2005 OUTLOOK The company expects EPS of $0.78 for the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of adopting SFAS123R. A number of factors are expected to impact results: -- Higher facility-action expenses than last year. -- The tax rate will be approximately 4 percentage points higher than last year. -- Incremental post-hurricane expenses noted in the U.S. business section previously detailed (United States Business Section) in this release. -- Interest expense will increase $8 to $10 million versus last year. Updates will be provided if there is a material change to these expectations. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK Based on year-to-date performance and information currently available, the company increased its full-year EPS expectations by $0.02 to $2.64 prior to special items. Projected factors contributing to the company's updated annual 2005 EPS guidance were published in the company's second-quarter earnings release dated July 13, 2005. Based on current information, the following is an update only on those full-year factors that have changed: -- Facility actions to include about $65 million of closure and impairment charges, an increase of approximately $30 million versus 2004. Refranchising gains are expected to be over $30 million for the full year versus $12 million last year. Annual Outlook Forecast Actual 2005 2004 Incr/(Decr) --------- ------- ----------- EPS prior to Special Items $2.64 $2.36 +12% Special Items EPS $0.01 $0.06 NM Reported EPS $2.65 $2.42 +10% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: This forecast is prior to the impact of adopting SFAS123R. FULL-YEAR 2006 OUTLOOK The company expects EPS growth of at least 10 percent, which is expected to be driven by new-restaurant expansion outside the U.S. and U.S. same-store-sales growth of +2% to +3%.

NOTES & DEFINITIONS FOR TERMS USED THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT China Division system-sales growth explanation: Estimated system-sales growth differs from the 11% reported in the Period 9 sales release, which compared like calendar months. For 2005, we have moved forward the mainland China business reporting calendar one month to more closely align the timing of reporting that business's results of operations with our U.S. business. China Division third- and fourth-quarter operating profit explanation: As part of the calendar shift previously described, China Division third-quarter operating profit benefited by $6 million due to reporting the higher sales in mainland China in Period 9 2005 (month of August) as part of the third-quarter result versus last year, when August was reported as part of the fourth quarter. Therefore, the fourth quarter will be negatively impacted by a similar amount due to this shift.

Sales and profit information included in the release is rounded to the nearest million; however, percentage-point-change calculations are based on numbers that are not rounded. Definitions: Excl F/x represents the percentage change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. These amounts are calculated by translating current-year results at prior-year average exchange rates. We believe elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. Franchise Fees include fees from unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures) and franchise and license restaurants. Fees include ongoing royalty and license fees, initial fees for new restaurants and contract-renewal fees. Franchise Restaurants include unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures) and franchise restaurants and exclude license restaurants. Franchise Net New-Restaurant Growth is the year-over-year total of franchise restaurant and unconsolidated affiliates (joint-venture) openings less franchise restaurant and unconsolidated affiliates (joint-venture) closings divided by the prior year's franchise and unconsolidated affiliates (joint-venture) restaurant total. New-Restaurant Openings include unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), company-owned and franchise restaurants and exclude license restaurants. Special Items include AmeriServe and other charges (credits) and Wrench litigation. System Restaurants include unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), company-owned and franchise restaurants but exclude license restaurants, which are typically nontraditional restaurants, such as airports, with substantially lower average unit volumes than traditional restaurant locations. System-Sales Growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership including unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), company-owned, franchise and license restaurants. Sales of unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), franchise and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), franchise and license restaurant sales are not included in company sales we present on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise fees previously defined are included in the company's revenues. We believe system-sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all our revenue drivers, company and franchise same-store sales as well as new-restaurant development. System Same-Store-Sales Growth is the estimated growth in sales of all restaurants that have been open one year or more regardless of ownership including unconsolidated affiliates (joint ventures), company-owned, franchise and license restaurants. Systemwide U.S. Same-Store Sales include all company, franchise and license restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. same-store sales include KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silver's and A&W restaurants. U.S. Blended Same-Store Sales include only company restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. blended same-store sales include KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell company-owned restaurants only. U.S. same-store sales for Long John Silver's and A&W restaurants are not included.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. Special items include the GAAP income statement captions of Wrench litigation and AmeriServe and other charges (credits). These amounts are described in (f) and (g) in the accompanying notes. The Company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations.

(b) In 2005, we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management structure. The China Division includes mainland China ("China"), Thailand and KFC Taiwan, and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, segment information for previous periods has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation. In 2005, we also changed the China business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our U.S. business. Previously our China business, like the rest of our international businesses, closed one month (or one period for certain of our international businesses) earlier than YUM's period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting. To maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations, net income of the China business of $6 million for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 was recognized as an adjustment to consolidated retained earnings in the year to date ended September 3, 2005, as opposed to being recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Our consolidated results of operations for the quarter and year to date ended September 3, 2005 include the results of operations of the China business for the months of June, 2005 through August, 2005 and January, 2005 through August, 2005, respectively, and the months to be included in future quarterly reporting periods will begin one month later than in previous years. Our consolidated results of operations for the quarter and year to date ended September 4, 2004 continue to include the results of operations of the China business for the months of May, 2004 through July, 2004 and December, 2003 through July, 2004, respectively. (c) Franchisee sales represent the combined estimated sales of unconsolidated affiliate, franchise and license restaurants. Franchisee sales, which are not included in the Company sales we present on the Consolidated Statements of Income, generate franchise and license fees (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales) that are included in the Company's revenues.

(e) Other (income) expense includes equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. In the quarter and year to date ended September 3, 2005 other (income) expense also includes a partial financial recovery of $14 million related to a China supplier ingredient issue. In the year to date ended September 3, 2005 other (income) expense also includes a $17 million gain associated with the IPO of our Poland/Czech Republic business. (f) Income of $2 million was recorded for the quarter and year to date ended September 3, 2005 from a settlement with an insurance carrier related to the legal judgment against Taco Bell Corp. on June 4, 2003, in Wrench v. Taco Bell Corp. (g) Amounts recorded as AmeriServe and other charges (credits) primarily result from cash recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, which were not significant for both the quarter and year to date ended September 3, 2005. (h) For the quarter and year to date ended September 3, 2005, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares and 13.6 million shares of our Common Stock, respectively, at an average price of $50 per share for both quarter and year to date.

Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. (a) Amounts do not reflect 189 International Division multibrand units in operation at the end of the period. There are no multibrand units in the China Division. CONTACT: Yum! Brands Inc.
