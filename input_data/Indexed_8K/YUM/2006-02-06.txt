Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports Full-Year 2005 Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $2.67, an Increase of 13% Prior to Special Items and Stock-Options Expensing; Reported 2005 Full-Year EPS including Stock-Options Expensing and a Special Items Credit Was $2.55 LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 6, 2006--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today also reported results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005, and provided its latest outlook for 2006. -- Fourth-quarter EPS was $0.81 prior to employee stock-options expensing. Reported EPS was $0.77 including stock-option expenses of $0.04 EPS. -- Raises full-year 2006 EPS outlook to $2.79 or growth of at least 10% prior to special items. In the fourth quarter, the company continued to expand its brands around the world and grow same-store sales: -- Worldwide system restaurants increased 2%. -- Worldwide system same-store sales grew by 2%. -- U.S. system same-store sales increased 3%. For the full-year 2005, key highlights were -- Worldwide system sales increased 5% in local currency terms and prior to benefit of the 53rd week. -- Worldwide system same-store sales grew by 3%. -- Worldwide system new-restaurant openings totaled a record 1,554 including a record 409 new-restaurant openings in our China Division. -- U.S. blended same-store sales increased 4%. -- Multibrand restaurants now in operation reached over 3,000 with 531 additions during 2005. -- Worldwide franchise fees increased 10% to a record $1.1 billion. -- Share buybacks totaled $1.1 billion, nearly double the prior best level in 2004. -- The quarterly dividend rate was increased 15% one year after the company initiated quarterly dividends. FULL-YEAR 2006 OUTLOOK The company continues to expect EPS growth of at least 10%, primarily driven by global expansion of 1,500 new restaurants and same-store-sales growth of +2% to +3% in the U.S. The current outlook for full-year 2006 EPS is $2.79 or at least 10% profit growth; this includes $0.13 of expense for employee stock options.

David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased to report 2005 was another year where we demonstrated the underlying power of our global portfolio of leading restaurant brands. Fueled by continued profitable international expansion, including a record 409 new restaurants in our China Division, another year of consistent same-store-sales performance from Taco Bell and a clear turnaround at KFC U.S., we achieved 13% EPS growth prior to special items and expensing stock options. This makes the fourth straight year of delivering on our commitment of at least 10% EPS growth. "Importantly for shareholders, this past year YUM reached several new milestones. We set new records in key areas: generated cash from operating activities of over $1.2 billion; earned over $1.1 billion in franchise fees; returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Additionally, we raised our quarterly dividend rate by 15% after establishing a dividend in 2004. "As we start 2006, we are very confident we can continue to build on our track record of growing EPS at least 10% each year. The key drivers are opening over 1,500 new restaurants globally and growing U.S. same-store sales by +2% to +3%. Given the strength of our fourth-quarter performance, we have raised our full-year 2006 EPS estimate one cent to $2.79 or at least 10% growth. "Shareholders should expect us to continue building consistent value by differentiating our global portfolio of brands and driving profitable global expansion through our four key strategies: building dominant restaurant brands in China, driving profitable international expansion, improving restaurant operations, and multibranding category-leading brands."

Key growth drivers for the Yum! Restaurants International (YRI) Division are new-restaurant openings across an array of international markets and leveraging our substantial infrastructure in place around the world. Over the long term, we expect our international franchise partners to open 85% or more of YRI new restaurants. Yum! Restaurants International opened 377 new restaurants in the fourth quarter and 780 new restaurants for the year. This included 394 KFCs, 336 Pizza Huts, 36 A&Ws, and 11 Taco Bells. Our franchise and joint-venture partners opened 93% of the 780 new restaurants. For the fourth quarter and full year, revenue growth in local currency terms was impacted by two unusual factors. First, refranchising (including Puerto Rico market in late 2004) negatively impacted fourth-quarter and full-year revenue growth by 7 and 10 percentage points respectively. For the full-year 2005, the company refranchised 137 restaurants. Second, a 53rd (extra) week in 2005 benefited revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year by 4 and 1 percentage points respectively. For the fourth quarter and full year, results for company operations were below target primarily due to negative same-store-sales performance in the U.K. and Pizza Hut South Korea. This adversely affected company sales, company restaurant profit growth and company restaurant-margin percentage for both the fourth quarter and full year. Mexico and Australia both contributed positively to the fourth-quarter results. Strong performance continued in YRI's franchise-only markets of Asia, Middle East, southern Africa, Europe and Caribbean/Latin America that drove overall growth for YRI in both the fourth quarter and full year. These markets represent KFC and Pizza Hut franchise businesses in more than 100 countries and territories and approximately 40% of overall YRI profit. For the fourth quarter, system-sales growth for the franchise-only markets was 12% in local currency terms including 6% growth in the number of restaurants. This led strong performance in YRI franchise fee growth. Overall, YRI franchise fees (in local currency terms) grew by 18% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year. For the full-year 2005, YRI produced system-sales growth of 5% in local currency terms and prior to the benefit of the 53rd week. This performance was right on our long-term target of at least +5% growth in system sales (local currency terms). The system-sales growth was driven by record new-restaurant openings and positive system same-store-sales growth. Operating profit, excluding options expense, grew by 14%; 11% in local currency terms. The 53rd extra week added $6 million of profit in the fourth quarter and full year. For 2006, YRI expects to again open over 700 new restaurants for the seventh consecutive year, generate at least 5% growth in system sales (local currency), improve restaurant-margin percentage and grow operating profit by about 10%. Capital spending is targeted at about $120 million. Foreign currency conversion did not significantly impact fourth-quarter operating profit. For the full year, the impact was a positive $11 million. For 2006, a negative impact is expected on operating profit of about $10 million including $4 million in the first quarter.

A key growth driver for the China Division is rapid new-restaurant expansion of multiple Yum! restaurant brands and leveraging our significant infrastructure in mainland China. Overall, system restaurants in operation grew 19%. During the fourth quarter, a total of 157 new restaurants were opened. For the full year, there were a record 409 new-restaurant openings, of which 71% were by the company. The new openings included 341 KFCs, 53 Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants, 11 Pizza Hut Home Service locations and 3 East Dawnings. Fourth-quarter performance was negatively impacted by consumer concerns related to avian flu and the lingering effects of consumers' reactions to a seasoning-supplier issue in the second quarter. Restaurant margin decreased 5.9 percentage points versus the prior year primarily as a result of negative same-store sales in company-operated KFC restaurants in mainland China. Operating profit for the fourth quarter benefited by $10 million of financial recovery from a seasoning supplier and by $24 million for the full year (included in other income). As communicated in our third-quarter 2005 earnings release, operating profit in the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by the change in reporting calendar timing for 2005. This reduced fourth-quarter profit by an estimated $6 million and benefited the third quarter by a like amount. For the full-year 2005, the China Division in local currency terms produced system-sales growth of 11%, below our ongoing target for at least 22% growth. The aforementioned seasoning-supplier issue and consumer concerns related to avian flu adversely impacted sales and operating-profit growth for a substantial portion of 2005. For 2006, the company expects system sales growth of at least 22% in local currency terms and at least 20% growth in operating profit. Capital spending is targeted at about $170 million. Foreign currency conversion added about $2 million to operating profit for the fourth quarter and $3 million for the full year 2005. For 2006, a positive impact is expected on operating profit of about $10 million. UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ---------------------- Fourth Quarter Full Year (million, except restaurant counts and percentages) 2005 2004 % Change 2005 2004 % Change ------- -------- -------- ------- -------- ---------- Financial Measures Revenues $1,816 $1,748 +4 $5,929 $5,763 +3 Operating Profit $235 $210 +11 $760 $777 (2) Operating Profit excluding Options Expense $241 $210 +15 $782 $777 +1 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Metrics Systemwide Same-Store-Sales Growth % +3 +3 NM +3 +3 NM System Multibrand Restaurants 3,096 2,641 +17 3,096 2,641 +17 System Restaurants 18,291 18,471 (1) 18,291 18,471 (1) Franchise Ownership % 74 73 +1 74 73 +1 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: 2004 operating-profit results do not reflect expenses related to employee stock options; multibrand restaurant details can be found on our Web site: www.yum.com/investors/restcounts.asp. Key growth drivers for this business segment are positive same-store-sales growth, improvements in productivity related to the cost structure and franchise development. Refranchising of company restaurants negatively impacted fourth-quarter and full-year revenue growth by 3 and 2 percentage points respectively. When company restaurants are refranchised, revenue from these restaurants changes from company sales to franchise royalty fees, significantly reducing the company's reported revenue for those restaurants. During 2005, 244 U.S. company restaurants were refranchised. Excluding the benefit of the extra 53rd week, the primary driver of revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year was higher same-store sales. Operating profit increased 5% for the fourth quarter, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week and stock options expense. Fourth quarter restaurant-margins improved by 1.4 percentage points prior to expensing stock options. The 53rd week added $20 million of profit in the fourth quarter and full year. For the full year 2005, excluding stock options expense, U.S. operating profit increased 1% and restaurant margin improved slightly. For 2006, the company expects +2% to +3% U.S. blended same-store-sales growth, an additional 550 system multibrand restaurants, improved restaurant-margin percentage, and operating profit growth of at least 5%. Capital spending is forecast to total about $380 million. In terms of changing trends, we experienced higher-than-expected energy costs (approximately $3 million) in the fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue into first-quarter 2006 with year-over-year utility inflation of approximately 20%. CORPORATE EXPENSES, OTHER INCOME & EXPENSES For the fourth quarter, the increase in unallocated and corporate expense versus last year was due in large part to $7 million of additional expense for discontinuing corporate software development projects and $6 million in stock options expense. We also recorded a $2 million nonrecurring increase to long-term liabilities related to employee benefits (an additional $5 million was recorded in the U.S. "Payroll and Employee Benefits" line). An additional $3 million of G&A expense was incurred for the extra 53rd week. Finally, we recorded a $6 million adjustment to our previously recorded gain relating to the IPO of our Poland/Czech Republic franchise business during the second quarter of 2005, which is reflected in the unallocated other income (expense) line. For the full year 2005, the increase in unallocated and corporate expense versus 2004 was due to $19 million in stock options expense and $16 million of charges related to potential resolution of certain litigation matters. CASH FLOW For the full year 2005, the company generated a record $1,238 million in net cash provided by operating activities, invested $609 million of capital spending in the business and repurchased $1,056 million of its own shares; 21 million shares were repurchased at an average cost of $50. STOCK-OPTIONS EXPENSING We adopted SFAS 123R, "Share-Based Payment," in the fourth quarter 2005 retroactive to the beginning of 2005. Accordingly, our results for the first three quarters of the year have been restated, as shown in the following table, to reflect the numbers previously disclosed on a pro forma basis in accordance with SFAS 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." Prior year numbers were not adjusted and do not reflect any expense related to stock options.

Timing of the Chinese New Year, occurring in late January this year versus February last year, positively impacted sales. Estimated first-quarter 2006 system-sales growth is expected to be at least +12% in local-currency terms, lapping strong growth of +26% in 2005 (including +65% in February 2005 or Period 3, 2005). Final January sales results for our China Division will be reported in the company's Period 2 results, to be released March 2, 2006.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results on a basis before stock option expense and special items. Special items include the GAAP income statement captions of Wrench litigation and AmeriServe and other charges (credits). Stock option expense relates to the fourth quarter adoption of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS 123, supersedes APB 25 and related interpretations and amends SFAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." SFAS 123R requires all share-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of income based on fair value. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified retrospective application transition method effective September 4, 2005, with retroactive application to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption (our fiscal year 2005). As such, the first three fiscal quarters of 2005 have been restated to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of SFAS 123. However, years prior to 2005 have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 resulted in a reduction of operating profit of $58 million, a reduction of net income of $38 million (net of tax benefits of $20 million), a reduction of diluted earnings per share of $0.13 per share, a reduction of $87 million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of $87 million in cash flows from financing activities. The Company used earnings before stock option expensing and before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally and determining incentive compensation in 2005. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of results before special items and stock option expense provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations and the adoption of SFAS 123R which did not impact our financial statements in the quarter and year to date ended December 25, 2004. Additionally, we are providing the impact of stock option expensing by segment and by income statement line item for the quarter and year to date ended December 31, 2005, as we believe such information is useful to investors in evaluating our performance versus prior year.

(b) In 2005, we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management structure. The China Division includes mainland China ("China"), Thailand and KFC Taiwan, and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, segment information for previous periods has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation. In 2005, we also changed the China business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our U.S. business. Previously our China business, like the rest of our international businesses, closed one month (or one period for certain of our international businesses) earlier than YUM's period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting. To maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations, net income of the China business of $6 million for the one month period ended December 31, 2004 was recognized as an adjustment to consolidated retained earnings in the year to date ended December 31, 2005, as opposed to being recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Our consolidated results of operations for the quarter and year to date ended December 31, 2005 include the results of operations of the China business for the months of September, 2005 through December, 2005 and January, 2005 through December, 2005, respectively. Our consolidated results of operations for the quarter and year to date ended December 25, 2004 continue to include the results of operations of the China business for the months of August, 2004 through November, 2004 and December, 2003 through November, 2004, respectively. (c) Franchisee sales represent the combined estimated sales of unconsolidated affiliate, franchise and license restaurants. Franchisee sales, which are not included in the Company sales we present on the Consolidated Statements of Income, generate franchise and license fees (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales) that are included in the Company's revenues.

In the quarter and year to date ended December 31, 2005 other (income) expense also includes a partial financial recovery of $10 million and $24 million, respectively, related to a China supplier ingredient issue. In the year to date ended December 31, 2005 other (income) expense also includes a $11 million gain associated with the IPO of our Poland/Czech Republic business, including a $6 million adjustment to the previously recorded gain in the quarter ended December 31, 2005. (f) Income of $2 million was recorded for the year to date ended December 31, 2005 from a settlement with an insurance carrier related to the legal judgment against Taco Bell Corp. on June 4, 2003, in Wrench v. Taco Bell Corp. (g) Income of $2 million was recorded for the quarter and year to date ended December 31, 2005 as AmeriServe and other charges (credits). The amount primarily resulted from cash recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. (h) For the quarter and year to date ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares and 21.3 million shares of our Common Stock, respectively, at an average price of $49 and $50 per share for the quarter and year to date, respectively. (i) We have reclassified dividends received from our unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated statements of cash flows from investing activities to operating activities, for all years presented. These dividend distributions represent returns of equity investments, and therefore have been reclassified to be in accordance with SFAS 95, "Accounting for Cash Flows." There was no impact on the previously reported consolidated statements of income or consolidated balance sheets as a result of these reclassifications. Dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates were $44 million and $55 million for the years ended 2005 and 2004, respectively. CONTACT: Yum! Brands Inc.
