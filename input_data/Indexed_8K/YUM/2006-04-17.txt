Assuming the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, valid execution, and delivery by the Trustee, the Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that (x) enforcement thereof may be limited by (i) the laws of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally (whether now or thereafter in effect), (ii) laws limiting rights of indemnity or contribution, or (iii) equitable principles of general applicability (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (y) the waiver contained in Section 6.12 of the Indenture may be deemed unenforceable.
(i)
                                    
 
Assuming the Debt Securities have been duly authorized by the Company, when issued, executed, and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and duly paid for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, the Debt Securities will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent that (x) enforcement thereof may be limited by (i) the laws of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally (whether now or hereafter in effect), (ii) laws limiting rights of indemnity or contribution, or (iii) equitable principles of general applicability (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity), and (y) the waiver contained in Section 6.12 of the Indenture may be deemed unenforceable.
(ii)

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the issuance and sale of the Debt Securities, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the Debt Securities and the Indenture, as the case may be, will not conflict with or constitute a breach or
(v)
                                
violation of or default (with the passage of time or otherwise) under (A) the Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or (B) subject to the Company's compliance with any applicable covenants pertaining to its incurrence of unsecured indebtedness contained therein, any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which breach or default would, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise.

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.
7.
                                      
 
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities as incurred, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing

provided
however
 
Each Underwriter severally (and not jointly) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters, but only with respect to such losses, claims, damages, and liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) that arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or omission or allegedly untrue statement or omission included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(b)
                                
 
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7, such person (the "") will promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, will retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and will pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party will have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party (whether or not the indemnifying party was an original named party to such proceeding) and the indemnified party and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be actual or potential conflicts of interest between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party including situations in which there may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from, or additional to, those available to the indemnifying party.  It is understood that the indemnifying party will not, in connection with any proceeding or substantially similar or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm will be designated in writing by the Manager (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph) or by the Company (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph), as the case may be.  The indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any claim, action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party will, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii)

indemnifying party
does not include a statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by, the indemnified party.  Any provision of this paragraph (c) to the contrary notwithstanding, no failure by an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party as required hereunder will relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have had to an indemnified party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or (b).
 
If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party thereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of Debt Securities by the Underwriters, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the offering of Debt Securities by the Underwriters will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds received by the Company from the offering of such Debt Securities bears to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company in respect thereof.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied or to be supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(d)
                                
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (d) above were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to therein.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company and the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third business day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Goldman, Sachs & Co, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors, and, at the Company's option, additional Primary Treasury
 
 
Dealers; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is prior to the Redemption Date of any Note will be payable to the Holder of such Note, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date referred to above, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed.  Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the Outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for redemption. If fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of such Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in authorized denominations in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of this Note shall relate, in the case that this Note is redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to that portion of the principal amount of this Note that has been or is to be redeemed.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.  Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities.   The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
The Indenture permits the Company, by irrevocably depositing, in amounts and maturities sufficient to pay and discharge at the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be, the entire indebtedness on all Outstanding Notes, cash or direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are fully guaranteed by, the United States government, and which are not subject to prepayment, redemption or call, with the Trustee in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of all Outstanding Notes, to defease the Indenture with respect to such Notes, and upon such deposit the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged its entire
 
 
indebtedness on such Notes. Thereafter, Holders would be able to look only to such trust fund for payment of principal and interest at the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be. The Indenture also permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the Company to be released from certain of its obligations under the Indenture on the terms and subject to the conditions therein provided.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6 or 9.5 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York of the United States of America, including without limitation, New York General Obligations Law Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 and New York Civil Practice Law and Rules 327.
