Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports 2006 First-Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.59 or +18% Versus Last Year; Raises Full-Year Forecast LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April, 24, 2006--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported record EPS results for the first quarter ended March 25, 2006. Note: All comparisons are versus the same period a year ago. In the first quarter, the company and its franchisees continued to expand its brands around the world and grow same-store sales: -- Yum! Restaurants International Division (YRI) grew the number of system restaurants by 4% led by franchise development. -- Mainland China restaurant unit growth was a very strong 21% driven by company expansion of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. -- U.S. blended system-same-store sales increased 5%. For the first quarter, key highlights are: -- Worldwide operating profit increased 12%. -- All three business segments reported operating-profit growth: YRI, +3%; China, +10%; and U.S., +19%. -- Worldwide franchise fees increased 9%. -- U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation expanded 16%. -- U.S. operating margin increased 2.2 percentage points. -- YRI operating margin increased 1.2 percentage points to 20.1%, a new record. -- Average diluted shares outstanding were reduced by 6%. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK The company raised its full-year EPS outlook to at least $2.81, 11% growth prior to special items, based on a very strong first quarter in the U.S. business. The company expects solid full-year operating-profit growth from each of its three segments: China, YRI and the U.S. The company's prior forecast for 2006 EPS was at least $2.79. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS First Quarter -------------------------------- 2006 2005 % Change ---------- ---------- ---------- System Restaurants 31,963 31,366 +2 System-Sales Growth 5% 7% NM Earnings Per Share (EPS) $0.59 $0.50 +18 - ------------------------------------------------------------------ David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "We had an outstanding first quarter. Our entire portfolio contributed to the strong worldwide first-quarter operating-profit growth of 12% and EPS growth of 18%. This performance is particularly impressive given the immense amount of global news coverage about avian flu. As a result, we are encouraged by our ability to continue to overcome consumer perception issues. Clearly, our customers are getting the message that fully cooked chicken is safe to eat. "Finally, we are pleased with the sales recovery of our mainland China business, reporting system-sales growth of 35% in local currency for March. This, in combination with our strong core profit growth in the first quarter and a much better U.S. commodity outlook, gives us confidence we will have another good year. As a matter of fact, we have raised our full-year 2006 EPS estimate to at least $2.81 or 11% growth. This would make the fifth straight year that we deliver against our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth. "Shareholders should continue to expect us to remain focused on flawlessly executing our four key strategies: building dominant restaurant brands in China, driving profitable international expansion, improving restaurant operations and multibranding category-leading brands." WHAT'S NEW IN THIS RELEASE For each of our business segments, YRI, China, and the U.S., we have provided key financial and operating metrics that we believe are tailored to what is important to each business segment. For YRI, where our business is highly franchised, we have focused on the performance of that aspect of the business and overall business profitability commonly designated as operating margin. Operating margin is operating profit dollars as a percentage of revenue dollars. This measure is more important and relevant than our company restaurant margin as we own only 12% of system restaurants. Conversely, for our China Division, which is predominantly company owned, the business is very much driven by company expansion in mainland China, therefore the key measures target company-restaurant sales and profitability performance. Company restaurant margin remains a key indicator. Additionally, we have added sales-growth data specific to just the mainland China portion of the business. In the U.S., we have provided same-store-sales growth, restaurant and operating margins to reflect a balanced view of the key drivers for our current business. Additionally, we have also provided key measures similar to YRI as that business transitions to a more franchise-focused model during the next 24 months. We believe these measures provide enhanced understanding and transparency with each of our three business segments and allow you to track our progress and performance. YUM! RESTAURANTS INTERNATIONAL DIVISION (YRI) First Quarter (million, except restaurant counts % Change and percentages) ----------------- 2006 2005 Reported Excl F/x -------- -------- -------- -------- Key Financial Measures Franchise & License Fees $110 $100 +10 +13 Franchisee Sales $2,071 $1,993 +4 +7 Company Sales $359 $384 (7) (5) Operating Margin 20.1% 18.9% +1.2 pt NA Operating Profit $95 $91 +3 +6 - ---------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Key Operating Metrics Local Currency System-Sales Growth +6 System Restaurants 11,378 10,933 +4 NA Franchise & JV Restaurants 10,012 9,444 +6 NA - ---------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Key growth driver: Franchise-fee growth by opening new franchise restaurants and leveraging our substantial infrastructure across an array of international markets. For the first quarter, franchise fees continued to grow as a result of new-restaurant expansion (+8%), positive same-store-sales growth, the renewal of franchise contracts at a higher rate, and the expansion of our franchise base due to the sales of company restaurants to franchisees (refranchising). The sale of 139 company-owned restaurants to franchisees took place over the past 12 months. Strong performance continued in YRI's franchise-only markets of Asia, southern Africa, Middle East and Caribbean/Latin America, despite some minor short-term impact to sales in various Middle East and European franchise markets from the avian flu during the first quarter. The franchise-only markets represent KFC and Pizza Hut franchise businesses in more than 100 countries and territories. For the first quarter, sales from company operations were negatively impacted by the refranchising of 139 company restaurants during the last year as previously mentioned. This impacted company-sales growth by 6 percentage points. In addition, same-store sales in the KFC U.K. and Pizza Hut South Korea company businesses were down versus last year, which offset positive growth in other company markets such as Mexico, Canada, France and Australia. As the year progresses, we look for performance in the U.K. market to slowly improve. YRI opened 124 new restaurants in the first quarter, 98% of those by franchise and joint-venture partners, including 59 KFCs, 59 Pizza Huts, 4 A&Ws, and 2 Taco Bells. For the first quarter of 2006, foreign currency conversion negatively impacted YRI operating profit by $2 million. We expect similar quarterly impacts for the balance of 2006. For YRI full-year 2006, we expect: -- System-sales growth to meet our annual target of at least 5% in local currency terms. -- 750 new restaurants, of which well over 80% should be by franchise and joint-venture partners. -- Franchise-fee growth of at least 8%. -- Operating-profit growth of 10% in local currency terms. All the full-year growth rates are on a like-for-like basis and exclude the fifty-third week benefit in 2005. CHINA DIVISION First Quarter (million, except restaurant counts % Change and percentages) ----------------- 2006 2005 Reported Excl F/x ------- ------- -------- -------- Key Financial Measures Company Sales $269 $227 +18 +16 Restaurant Margin 21.8% 23.1% (1.3) NA Operating Profit $58 $52 +10 +8 - ------------------------------------ ------- ------- -------- -------- Key Operating Metrics Mainland China: KFC Restaurants 1,602 1,335 +20 NA Pizza Hut Restaurants 243 186 +31 NA Local Currency System-Sales Growth +15 - ------------------------------------ ------- ------- -------- -------- Note: China Division includes mainland China, Thailand and the KFC Taiwan business. Key growth driver: Profitable expansion of new KFC and Pizza Hut company restaurants in mainland China. For the first quarter 2006, company sales for the China Division increased 16% in local currency due to the continued strong expansion of both our KFC and Pizza Hut brands in mainland China. KFC sales in mainland China began to recover from consumer perception issues relating to avian flu that peaked in the fourth quarter of 2005. For the first quarter, system-same-store sales in mainland China decreased only 3% versus a strong first quarter last year. As sales trends improved in the first quarter, restaurant margin is over 20% once again. Versus last year, it declined 1.3 percentage points primarily as a result of higher labor costs and negative same-store sales in company-operated mainland China KFC restaurants. We are optimistic that both same-store sales and margin trends will reverse beginning in the second quarter. Overall, mainland China system restaurants in operation grew 21% with a total of 63 new restaurants. Foreign currency conversion added approximately $1 million to operating profit for the first quarter. We expect this quarterly trend to continue for the balance of 2006, possibly at a slightly higher rate. For the China Division full-year 2006 in local currency terms, we expect: -- Company-sales growth of at least 22%. -- System-sales growth of at least 22%. -- Operating-profit growth of at least 20%. -- 375 new-restaurant openings in mainland China and 400 in total for the Division. UNITED STATES BUSINESS First Quarter (million, except restaurant counts and percentages) 2006 2005 % Change ------- ------- --------- Key Financial Measures Franchisee Sales $2,912 $2,682 +9 Franchise & License Fees $148 $136 +9 Company Sales $1,191 $1,199 (1) Restaurant Margin 15.0% 13.1% +1.9 Operating Margin 14.0% 11.8% +2.2 Operating Profit $188 $157 +19 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Operating Metrics Blended System Same-Store-Sales Growth % +5 +3 NM System Multibrand Restaurants 3,160 2,726 +16 Franchise Restaurants 13,630 13,447 +1 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key growth drivers: Positive blended same-store-sales growth, improvements in restaurant and operating margins. For the first quarter, franchisee sales and fees continued to grow as a result of strong same-store-sales growth, adding new restaurants led by Taco Bell franchisees and the expansion of our franchise base due to the sale of 308 company-owned restaurants to franchisees (refranchising) over the past year. Company sales declined by 1% for the first quarter as the impact of refranchising 308 company-owned restaurants the past 12 months offset solid same-store-sales growth. Additionally, we have begun unit expansion of Taco Bell in the U.S. Taco Bell units increased 1% compared to last year. We expect this trend to continue and for the rate of growth to slowly increase over time. The primary driver of improvements in first-quarter restaurant and operating margins was strong same-store-sales growth and a much improved commodity-cost environment. Overall, commodity costs declined by approximately $8 million versus last year. For the U.S. in 2006, we expect: -- +2% to +3% U.S. blended same-store-sales growth. -- Additional 550 system multibrand restaurants. -- Full-year operating-profit growth of at least 6%, raised from 5% previously. -- U.S. revenue to decrease 1 to 2%, excluding the impact of lapping the fifty-third week in 2005; including the impact of lapping the fifty-third week in 2005, revenue to decrease 2 to 3%. This forecast incorporates the impact from our ongoing refranchising of U.S. company restaurants. FRANCHISE FEES & FRANCHISE OWNERSHIP For the first quarter, worldwide franchise fees increased by 9% to $266 million, a new record level. Franchise fees continue to be an increasing source of worldwide operating profit. We have over 2,000 franchise partners in the U.S. and over 700 outside the U.S. As previously communicated, the company is targeting to increase franchise ownership from 75% currently in the U.S. business to about 80% over the next two years. This two-year plan in the U.S. business calls for selling approximately 1,000 company restaurants to franchisees. It is expected the impact to ongoing worldwide operating profit will be neutral and refranchise gains/losses are expected to be about break-even. Importantly, this action will put these restaurants in the hands of experienced and highly capable local franchise operators. During the first quarter of 2006, 75 company-owned U.S. restaurants were sold to our franchisees. Over the two years of the plan, we expect the transactions with our franchisees will result in about $300 million of pretax cash proceeds. Furthermore, we expect company capital requirements to be reduced as a result of these transactions, U.S. restaurant margin to improve by at least 0.50 percentage points and Yum! return on invested capital (ROIC) to increase by at least 0.75 percentage points. FREE CASH FLOW For the past four quarters, including first-quarter 2006, free cash flow continues at a substantial level; we generated $236 million in free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities ($297 million) less net cash used in investing activities ($61 million). As we have previously communicated, our objective is to return virtually all free cash flow to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and share buybacks. For the first quarter, we purchased 7.6 million shares for $371 million. For the full year 2006, we expect free cash flow, as previously defined, to approximate $850 million. PERIOD 4 SALES INTERNATIONAL DIVISION SYSTEM-SALES GROWTH (Estimated) 2006 2005 Local Currency Local Currency ------------------ ------------------ Period 4 +5% +7% - ---------------------------------------------------------- Including the negative impact of foreign currency conversion, reported Period 4 system sales in U.S. dollars increased 1%. CHINA DIVISION SYSTEM-SALES GROWTH (Estimated) 2006 2005 Local Currency Local Currency ------------------ ------------------ Period 4 +25% +10% - ---------------------------------------------------------- Note: China Division includes mainland China, Thailand and the KFC Taiwan business. Overall for the China Division, Period 4 system sales in U.S. dollars increased 28%. This includes the positive impact of foreign currency conversion. The mainland China business represents the largest portion of our Yum! China Division. Therefore, we have begun to provide results for just mainland China in addition to the overall division results. System-sales growth for mainland China in Period 4 was +35% local currency basis.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (a) Percentages may not recompute due to rounding. (b) All periods presented reflect the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS 123R) effective September 4, 2005. The Company adopted SFAS 123R by applying the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of 2005, and as such the first three fiscal quarters of 2005 were adjusted to recognize the compensation cost for stock options previously reported only in the financial statement proforma footnote disclosures as required by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation". (c) Amounts presented as of and for the quarter ended March 25, 2006 are preliminary. (d) Other (income) expense primarily includes equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and, in the quarter ended March 25, 2006, an $8 million charge associated with the termination of a beverage agreement in the United States segment. (e) For the quarter ended March 25, 2006, we repurchased approximately 7.6 million shares of our Common Stock at an average price of $49 per share. (f) In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has presented the non-GAAP measurement of free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities less Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. We believe free cash flow is an important measure as it provides an indication of amounts available to return to our shareholders, through either share repurchases or dividends, or to pay down long-term debt. Free cash flow for the past four quarters is computed as follows: Quarter Ended ----------------------------------- ------- 3/25/06 12/31/05 9/3/05 6/11/05 Total -------- --------- ------- -------- ------- Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $297 $243 $ 424 $339 $1,303 Net Cash used in Investing Activities (61) (75) (113) (52) (301) -------- --------- ------- -------- ------- Free Cash Flow $236 $168 $ 311 $287 $1,002 ======== ========= ======= ======== ======= CONTACT: Yum!
