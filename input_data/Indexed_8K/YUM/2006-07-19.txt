Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports Strong 2006 Second-Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.68 or +15% Versus Last Year; Raises Full-Year Forecast LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2006--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 17, 2006, and provided estimated Period 7 global sales results. In the second quarter, we and our franchise partners continued to expand our brands around the world and grow same-store sales: -- Yum! Restaurants International Division (YRI) system restaurants grew by 4%. -- Mainland China KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants increased by 21%. -- Worldwide system same-store sales grew by 2%. For the second quarter, key highlights are . . . -- Worldwide operating profit increased 18%. -- All three business segments reported operating-profit growth: YRI, 2%; China, 136%; and U.S., 5%. -- Worldwide franchise fees increased 7%. -- China Division restaurant margin increased nearly 5 percentage points. -- U.S. multibrand restaurants in operation expanded 15%. -- Average diluted shares outstanding were reduced by 7%. -- Announced a 30% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, payable August 4, 2006. Note: All preceding comparisons are versus the same period a year ago. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK The company raised its full-year earnings per share (EPS) outlook to at least $2.83, or 11% growth, based on very strong second-quarter results in our China Division and an expected strong second half of 2006 for YRI. The company expects solid full-year operating-profit growth from each of its three divisions: China, YRI, and the U.S. The company's prior EPS guidance for 2006 was at least $2.81. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - --------------------------------- Second Quarter Year To Date ------------------------- ------------------------- 2006 2005 % Change 2006 2005 % Change ------- ------- --------- ------- ------- --------- Traditional Restaurants 32,022 31,434 +2 32,022 31,434 +2 System-Sales Growth +5% +7% NM +5% +7% NM Earnings Per Share (EPS) $0.68 $0.59 +15 $1.28 $1.09 +17 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: YUM has 34,165 restaurant locations around the world, which includes 2,143 license units. David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased to report we had another outstanding quarter. Our entire portfolio contributed to the strong worldwide second-quarter operating profit growth of 18% and EPS growth of 15%. Given the robust growth we expect from our China and YRI Divisions, we are able to once again raise our full-year EPS forecast from at least $2.81 to at least $2.83. "Our China business is obviously experiencing booming growth. It's particularly impressive that we are achieving record second-quarter restaurant margin as we are on track to open another 400 new restaurants this year. In addition, our Yum! Restaurants International Division brings strong business trends into the second half and is expected to exceed our target of opening at least 750 new restaurants for 2006. This will be the sixth straight year of at least 1,000 new restaurants opened outside the U.S., and we expect to maintain at least that development pace going forward into 2007. "In the U.S., significant improvement in commodity costs will more than offset what we believe is short-term sales softness that Taco Bell and KFC experienced during Period 7, as the brands lapped last year's outstanding same-store-sales growth of +10% and +7% respectively. We are confident of our positioning and programs for these brands and expect to have overall positive same-store-sales growth at both of them for the second half of 2006. At Pizza Hut, we foresee a slow recovery as the brand begins to execute a turnaround plan. Overall, we expect to grow the operating profit of our U.S. business by 6%, our strongest performance in four years. "This will be our fifth straight year where we demonstrate the strength of our portfolio to deliver at least 10% EPS growth. The key factor for the consistency of our growth is our global portfolio that provides us the opportunity to build dominant restaurant brands in China, drive profitable international expansion, improve U.S. brands and operations, and multibrand category-leading brands." YUM! RESTAURANTS INTERNATIONAL DIVISION (YRI) - --------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year to Date ($ million, % % except Change Change restaurant -------- -------- counts and Excl Excl percentages) 2006 2005 Reported F/x 2006 2005 Reported F/x ------------------------------------------------------- Key Financial Measures Franchise & License Fees 108 98 +10 +12 218 198 +10 +13 Franchisee Sales 2,026 1,895 +7 +10 4,097 3,888 +5 +9 Company Sales 381 394 (3) (2) 740 778 (5) (3) Operating Margin 18.1% 17.7% +0.4 ppt NA 19.1% 18.3% +0.8 ppt NA Operating Profit 88 87 +2 +5 183 178 +3 +5 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Operating Metrics System-Sales Growth (Local Currency) +8 +7 System Restaurants 11,438 10,978 +4 NA 11,438 10,978 +4 NA Franchise & JV Restaurants 10,087 9,539 +6 NA 10,087 9,539 +6 NA - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key growth driver: Franchise-fee growth by opening new franchise restaurants and leveraging our substantial infrastructure across an array of international markets. For the second quarter, franchise fees continued to grow as a result of new-restaurant expansion, same-store-sales growth of 4%, and the expansion of our franchise base due to the sale of company restaurants to franchisees (refranchising). YRI opened 152 new restaurants in the second quarter, 92% of those by franchise and joint-venture partners, including 87 KFCs, 54 Pizza Huts, 9 A&Ws, and 2 Taco Bells. Strong same-store-sales-growth performance continued in YRI's franchise-only markets of Asia, southern Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean/Latin America. For the second quarter, company sales were negatively affected by the refranchising of 103 company restaurants over the past year, impacting company-sales growth by 5 percentage points. Company same-store-sales growth was slightly positive, improving from a decline in the first quarter. In our emerging-markets category, we finalized the acquisition of the Rostik's brand in Russia during the second quarter. As we convert the existing Rostik's restaurants, we will add a substantial number of new cobranded Rostik's/KFCs in Russia over the next 18 months. In India, our scale continues to build with 125 Pizza Hut and 15 KFC restaurants currently in operation. Foreign currency conversion for the second quarter negatively impacted YRI operating profit by $3 million and $5 million year to date. Based on current foreign currency rates, we expect that the balance-of-year conversion impact will be slightly favorable. For YRI full-year 2006 in local-currency terms we expect: -- System-sales growth of 7%, from at least 5% previously. -- To exceed our target of 750 new restaurants. -- Franchise-fee growth of at least 10%, from at least 8% previously. -- Operating-profit growth of 10%. These full-year growth rates are on a like-for-like basis excluding the fifty-third-week benefit in 2005. CHINA DIVISION - -------------- Second Quarter Year to Date ($ million, except % % restaurant counts Change Change and percentages) -------- -------- Excl Excl 2006 2005 Reported F/x 2006 2005 Reported F/x ---------------------------------------------------- Key Financial Measures Company Sales 352 268 +31 +28 621 495 +25 +23 Restaurant Margin 18.8% 13.9% +4.9 NA 20.1% 18.1% +2.0 NA Operating Profit 57 25 +136 +130 115 77 +50 +46 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Operating Metrics MAINLAND CHINA: KFC Restaurants 1,657 1,378 +20 NA 1,657 1,378 +20 NA Pizza Hut Restaurants 252 201 +25 NA 252 201 +25 NA System-Sales Growth (Local Currency) +36 +26 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: China Division includes mainland China, Thailand and the KFC Taiwan business. Key growth driver: Profitable expansion of new KFC and Pizza Hut company restaurants in mainland China. For the second quarter 2006, company sales for the China Division increased 28% in local currency due to the continued strong expansion of both our KFC and Pizza Hut brands in mainland China. Mainland China system restaurants in operation grew 21% and system-same-store sales grew 16%. Second-quarter 2006 operating profit increased 130% in local currency terms versus second quarter last year. The key contributing factor to the significant increase was continued improvement in mainland China KFC sales trends, lapping the negative sales impact that KFC restaurants experienced during the second quarter last year from an unapproved food ingredient issue. Importantly, second-quarter restaurant margin was up solidly even against results from 2004. Foreign currency conversion added approximately $2 million to operating profit for the second quarter and $3 million year to date. We expect similar favorable quarterly impacts from foreign currency conversion for the balance of 2006. For the China Division full-year 2006 in local currency terms, we expect: -- System-sales growth of at least 22%. -- Operating-profit growth of at least 25%, from at least 20% previously. -- 375 new-restaurant openings in mainland China and 400 in total for the Division.

For the second quarter, franchise sales and fees continued to grow as a result of adding new franchise restaurants and the expansion of our franchise-system base across all brands due to the sale of 268 company-owned restaurants to franchisees (refranchising) over the past year. Company sales declined by 5% for the second quarter from the impact of refranchising 268 company-owned restaurants the past 12 months. The key driver of improvements in second-quarter restaurant and operating margins was a much improved commodity-cost environment. Overall, commodity costs declined by approximately $16 million versus last year. For the U.S. in 2006, we expect: -- Approximately +1% U.S. blended same-store-sales growth, from +2% to +3% previously. -- Significantly lower commodity costs: approximately $40 million favorable impact versus 2005, from $18 million favorable impact previously expected. -- Full-year operating-profit growth of 6% on a like-for-like basis excluding the fifty-third-week benefit in 2005. U.S. FRANCHISE OWNERSHIP UPDATE As previously communicated, in the U.S. business we have targeted to sell approximately 1,000 company restaurants to franchisees during 2006 and 2007. We are currently ahead of schedule in this plan and remain fully confident of meeting or exceeding our original two-year plan. For the full year 2006, we now expect cash proceeds of at least $250 million versus the original target of $150 million. Year to date 2006, 107 company-owned U.S. restaurants have been sold to our franchisees. FREE CASH FLOW For full-year 2006, we continue to expect to generate about $1.3 billion in Cash from Operating Activities. In addition, we are lowering our full-year capital spending from $675 million to about $625 million and increasing our expected cash proceeds from refranchising by $100 million from the original target of $150 million to $250 million. These are the key drivers to free cash available and after including all changes to our forecasted sources and uses of cash, we expect our free cash available for the full year 2006 to increase by approximately $100 to $150 million. The reduction in full-year capital spending reflects a mid-year fine tuning of our global forecast, no major development changes. As we have previously communicated, our objective is to return virtually all free cash available to our shareholders through our share buybacks and quarterly dividends. During the second quarter of 2006, we purchased 3.2 million shares for $158 million and announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of 30% to $0.15 per share payable August 4, 2006. Year-to-date share repurchases total $529 million. PERIOD 7 SALES - -------------- INTERNATIONAL DIVISION SYSTEM-SALES GROWTH (Estimated) 2006 2005 Local Currency Local Currency -------------- -------------- Period 7 +8% +5% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- YRI Period 7 system-sales growth benefited by approximately 1 ppt. from the inclusion of the Rostik's restaurants in Russia. On March 24, 2006, YUM acquired the Rostik's brand. We have just begun the two-year process of cobranding the 94 Rostik's and the existing 18 franchise KFCs into Rostik's/KFC restaurants. YRI Period 7 system sales in U.S. dollars increased 10%. CHINA DIVISION SYSTEM-SALES GROWTH (Estimated) 2006 2005 Local Currency Local Currency ------------------ ------------------ Period 7 +24% +5% - ---------------------------------------------------------- Note: China Division includes mainland China, Thailand and the KFC Taiwan business. Including the positive impact of foreign currency conversion, reported Period 7 system sales in U.S. dollars increased 28%. System-sales growth for mainland China in Period 7 was +28% local currency basis, +33% in U.S. dollars.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (a) Percentages may not recompute due to rounding. (b) All periods presented reflect the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS 123R) effective September 4, 2005. The Company adopted SFAS 123R by applying the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of 2005, and as such the first three fiscal quarters of 2005 were adjusted to recognize the compensation cost for stock options previously reported only in the financial statement proforma footnote disclosures as required by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation". Previously reported diluted EPS prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R and this adjustment was $0.62 and $1.15 in the quarter and year to date ended June 11, 2005, respectively. (c) Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year to date ended June 17, 2006 are preliminary. (d) Other (income) expense primarily includes equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. In the quarter ended March 25, 2006, we also recorded an $8 million charge associated with the termination of a beverage agreement in the United States segment as other expense. In the quarter ended June 11, 2005, we recorded a $17 million gain associated with the IPO of our Poland/Czech Republic business as other income. (e) In the quarter ended June 17, 2006, the International Division ("YRI") and Rostiks Restaurant Ltd. ("RRL"), a franchisor and operator of a chicken chain in Russia, finalized a five-year partnership to develop fast-food restaurants in Russia and the surrounding states. Under the terms of the agreement, YRI acquired RRL's trademarks, patents, recipes, operating platform and franchise fees rights for $10 million in the current quarter with another $5 million due upon final registration and assignment of the RRL trademark. This agreement did not have a material impact on revenue or operating profit for the quarter ended June 17, 2006. (f) For the quarter and year to date ended June 17, 2006, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares and 10.7 million shares of our Common Stock, respectively, at an average price of $50 and $49 per share for the quarter and year to date, respectively.

Exhibit 99.2 July 19, 2006 FULL-YEAR 2006 DETAILED GUIDANCE UPDATE The company expects . . . o Worldwide system-sales growth of +5% to +6%; International Division system-sales growth, local-currency basis, of +7% (from at least +5% local-currency basis); China Division system-sales growth of at least +22%, and U.S. system-sales growth of about +3% (from +3% to +4%). These growth rates are prior to the impact of lapping the fifty-third week in 2005. Including the fifty-third week, growth rates for 2006 would be reduced by 1% point in the worldwide, U.S. and International divisions. o Worldwide revenue growth of about 2% (from +4% to +5%); China Division, +20%; International Division, at least 1%; and U.S., down 3% to 4% (from +1% to 2%). These growth rates are prior to the impact of lapping the fifty-third week in 2005. Including the fifty-third week, growth for 2006 would be reduced by 1% point in the worldwide, U.S. and International Division growth rates. Note: Updated refranchising activity for 2005 and 2006 negatively impacts all these growth rates except the China Division. o U.S. blended same-store-sales growth at company restaurants of approximately +1% (from +2% to +3%). o At least 1,500 new system restaurants to be opened worldwide: - 750 new International Division restaurants - 400 new China Division restaurants - 350 new U.S. restaurants o International Division net-restaurant expansion to be at least +3%. o The U.S. restaurant base is expected to decrease slightly versus 2005. o About 550 multibrand restaurant additions for the U.S. system, including conversions of existing restaurants, rebuilds, and new builds. o Growth in franchise fees of about +8% (from at least 5%) resulting from worldwide restaurant expansion, same-store-sales growth, and refranchising. o Worldwide restaurant margin improvement of about +1 percentage point (from slightly favorable) versus 2005, with improvement expected in each division. o General and administrative costs will increase versus 2005 by approximately +1% with increased China spending to support unit expansion. Franchise and license expense will be even. o Interest expense will be up at least $15 million (from $10 to $15 million) versus 2005. o Closure and impairment charges of $45 to $50 million. Refranchising gains are expected to be $0 to $15 million.
o Slightly positive impact (from no net impact) from foreign currency conversion on operating profit for the full year. This assumes approximately $7 million (from $10 million) of benefit in the China Division offset by approximately $5 million (from $10 million) of negative impact for the International Division. The Chinese renminbi, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Korean won, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and European euro are important currencies in the company's international business. o Average shares outstanding to be about 280 million shares (from a range of 285 to 290 million) or down 6% from last year. o Effective tax rate of 26% to 28%. o Return on invested capital to remain at about 18%. o Capital expenditures to be about $625 million (from $675 million). Pretax refranchising and surplus PP&E proceeds of about $300 million (from $200 million) are expected, resulting in net capital spending of about $325 million being invested in the business. o Additional refranchising in the U.S. will reduce company ownership from the current level of 25% to 20% by the end of 2007. The company will provide additional annual guidance for these preceding items only when there is a material change to the full-year expectations previously noted. Otherwise these expectations for full-year 2006 remain in effect.
