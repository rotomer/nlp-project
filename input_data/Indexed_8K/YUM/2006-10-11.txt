Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports Strong 2006 Third-Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.83 or +20% Versus Last Year Led by Powerful Growth in China and International; Raises Full-Year Forecast to $2.89 from $2.83 LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 11, 2006--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 9, 2006, and provided estimated Period 10 global sales results. Highlights for the third quarter are . . . -- Worldwide operating profit increased 11%. -- Strong double-digit operating-profit growth from our international divisions: China, 26%; YRI, 22%. -- Mainland China new-restaurant growth of 18%. -- Yum! Restaurants International Division (YRI) new-restaurant growth of 4%. -- Worldwide franchise fees increased 8%. -- Restaurant margin increased 1.3 percentage points worldwide and grew in all three business segments. -- Average diluted shares outstanding were reduced by 7%. Note: All preceding comparisons are versus the same period a year ago. FULL-YEAR EPS OUTLOOK We have raised our full-year EPS outlook to $2.89, or 14% growth prior to special items, based on continued very strong growth from our China Division and double-digit growth from our YRI Division. The company's prior EPS guidance for 2006 was at least $2.83. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Third Quarter Year To Date ---------------------------------------------------- 2006 2005 % Change 2006 2005 % Change ------- ------- --------- ------- ------- --------- Traditional Restaurants 32,146 31,537 +2 32,146 31,537 +2 System-Sales Growth +5% +6% NM +5% +7% NM Reported EPS $0.83 $0.69 +20 $2.10 $1.78 +18 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: YUM has 34,274 restaurant locations around the world, which include 2,128 license units. David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "We have continuously positioned Yum! Brands to deliver consistent global growth while at the same time generating substantial and increasing cash flow. "Third-quarter performance demonstrated our global growth once again led by 26% profit growth in China and 22% growth at YRI. As a result third-quarter EPS increased by 20% despite a 2% decline in U.S. same-store sales and U.S. profit growth of 1%. Fueled by this continued strong profit growth from each of our international divisions, we have once again raised our full-year EPS forecast, increasing it from $2.83 to $2.89 or 14% growth. This marks our fifth straight year of at least 13% EPS growth, exceeding our annual target of at least 10% growth. Importantly, we continue to build even stronger market positions in our China and YRI businesses. "At the same time, our company generates substantial free cash available for payout to our shareholders with the U.S. business leading the way. We expect to return over $1 billion to shareholders again this year in the form of share buybacks and an increased dividend. For 2006, this payout is substantial for each of our long-term shareholders as our share count will be reduced by 6%, and our dividend provides an additional return of more than 1%. We fully expect to continue to return similar substantial amounts of cash to shareholders for the foreseeable future. "Looking ahead, the growing strength of our China and YRI businesses gives us continued confidence in our ability to sustain annual EPS growth of at least 10% while we consistently generate substantial cash. "We remain focused on our four key strategies: (1) build dominant restaurant brands in China, (2) drive profitable international expansion, (3) improve U.S. brands and operations, and (4) multibrand category-leading brands." YUM! RESTAURANTS INTERNATIONAL DIVISION (YRI) Key growth driver: Franchise-fee growth by opening new franchise restaurants and leveraging our substantial infrastructure across an array of international markets.

Additionally, the expansion of our franchise-restaurant base due to the sale of company restaurants to franchisees (refranchising) added to growth in franchise fees. YRI opened 176 new restaurants in the third quarter and 452 year to date with franchisees opening 94% of the total year to date. Strong system-sales-growth performance continued in YRI's franchise-only markets driven by both solid growth in new units and same-store sales. For the third quarter, company sales were reduced by the impact of refranchising 157 company restaurants over the past year. Company-sales growth of +3% was lower by 6 percentage points due to this change in restaurant ownership. Overall, company same-store-sales growth was +4%, improving from a decline in the first quarter and slightly positive results in the second quarter. Operating margin increased 2.7 percentage points in the third quarter driven by strong franchise performance reflected by 15% growth in franchise fees. We received regulatory approval to complete the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership of the Pizza Hut U.K. joint venture from Whitbread PLC on September 12, 2006. We expect some additional balance-of-year operating-profit growth from this business. For YRI full-year 2006, we expect . . . -- System-sales growth of at least 7%. -- New-restaurant openings of at least 770. -- Operating profit of at least +10%. These full-year growth rates are in local currency and excluding the impact of the fifty-third week last year. CHINA DIVISION Key growth driver: Profitable expansion of new KFC and Pizza Hut company restaurants in mainland China.

For the third quarter 2006, company sales for the China Division increased 25% in local-currency terms due to the continued strong expansion of both our KFC and Pizza Hut brands in mainland China. Each brand is the market leader within the quick-service category and casual-dining category respectively. Mainland China system restaurants in operation grew 18%, and system-same-store sales grew 12% in local-currency terms. Third-quarter 2006 operating profit increased 23% in local-currency terms versus last year. The key contributing factor was continued growth in both our KFC and Pizza Hut brands' sales in mainland China. Importantly, third-quarter restaurant margin reached an all-time record. Last year, third-quarter China Division operating profit included $14 million in other income from a one-time financial recovery from a supplier. For the China Division full-year 2006 in local currency, we expect .. . . -- System-sales growth of 24%. -- Operating-profit growth in the range of 35% to 40%. UNITED STATES BUSINESS Key growth drivers: Positive blended same-store-sales growth, improvements in restaurant and operating margins. ($ million, except Third Quarter Year to Date restaurant counts and % % percentages) 2006 2005 Change 2006 2005 Change ---------------------------------------------- Key Financial Measures Franchisee Sales 3,048 2,999 +2 8,927 8,530 +5 Company Sales 1,145 1,239 -8 3,515 3,678 -4 Franchise & License Fees 155 154 +1 454 435 +4 Restaurant Margin % 14.1 13.9 +0.2 ppt 15.1 13.8 +1.3 ppt Operating Margin % 14.2 13.2 +1.0 ppt 14.2 12.8 +1.4 ppt Operating Profit 183 183 +1 565 525 +8 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Operating Metrics Blended System Same-Store-Sales Growth % -2 +4 NM +1 +4 NM System Multibrand Restaurants 3,277 2,918 +12 3,277 2,918 +12 Franchise Restaurants 13,662 13,530 +1 13,662 13,530 +1 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- For the third quarter, franchise sales and fees grew slightly as a result of opening new franchise restaurants and the expansion of our franchise-restaurant base due to the sale of 307 company-owned restaurants to franchisees (refranchising) over the past year. Company sales declined by 8% for the third quarter primarily from the impact of refranchising 307 company-owned restaurants the past 12 months. The key drivers of improvement in third-quarter restaurant and operating margins were a much improved commodity-cost environment and lower impairment expenses versus a year ago respectively. Overall, commodity costs declined by approximately $10 million versus last year. For the U.S. in 2006, we expect . . . -- Blended same-store sales to be flat. -- Operating-profit growth of +3% to +5%, excluding the fifty-third-week benefit in 2005. U.S. FRANCHISE OWNERSHIP UPDATE As previously communicated, in the U.S. business we have targeted to sell approximately 1,000 company restaurants to franchisees during 2006 and 2007. We are on schedule and remain fully confident of meeting our original two-year plan. Year-to-date 2006, 191 company-owned U.S. restaurants have been sold to our franchisees. Our two-year program was originally targeted to produce cash proceeds of $300 million, improve restaurant margin by at least 0.5 percentage points, improve ROIC by at least 0.75 percentage points, and have a neutral impact on U.S. operating profit. Our latest estimate is that cash proceeds for 2006 alone will total at least $250 million versus the original target of $150 million. Operating-profit impact for the U.S. in 2006 will be slightly negative, offset in 2007 by reduced G&A related to the operation of company restaurants sold during 2006. FREE CASH FLOW For full-year 2006, we continue to expect to generate about $1.3 billion in Cash from Operating Activities and about $700 million of free cash flow after capital expenditures. As we have previously communicated, our objective is to return virtually all free cash available to our shareholders through our share buybacks and quarterly dividends after investing more than $600 million in our worldwide businesses. For the full year 2006, we expect the total payout to net about 7% to shareholders, which includes significant share buybacks, reducing share count by 6%, and approximately 1% returned through the quarterly dividend. During the third quarter of 2006, we purchased 7.1 million shares for $337 million. Year-to-date share repurchases totaled $853 million.
