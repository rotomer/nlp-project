YUM! BRANDS DOUBLES ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND
 
LOUISVILLE, KY.  December 5, 2006  Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) announced today that its Board of Directors approved a 100% increase in the Company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.15 to $0.30 per share. This higher cash dividend payment will be distributed March 30, 2007, in the company's fiscal second quarter.
 
David C. Novak, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "As a result of our continued confidence in the expansion of our global business with high returns and substantial cash flow generation, I am very pleased to inform our shareholders that we are doubling our quarterly dividend rate. By increasing our quarterly cash dividend to $0.30 per share, we have tripled our quarterly dividend-payment rate to shareholders since we initiated dividends in May 2004.
 
"Our business generates significant free cash flow, even after investing capital in all our growth opportunities around the world, and we expect to return this free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of substantial share buybacks and dividend growth. For 2006, we expect to pay out over $1 billion to our shareholders, including dividends and share buybacks, which we expect will reduce our share count by 6%. In addition, for 2007 we expect to return over $1 billion to our shareholders, with share buybacks reducing our share count by at least 3% and an attractive dividend yield. We fully expect to continue to return significant free cash to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.
 
"With the unique growth opportunities of our global portfolio and our significant cash generation capability from all our businesses, we expect to continue to return substantial free cash flow to our shareholders, proving once more why we are not your ordinary restaurant company."
