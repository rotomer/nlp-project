CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - ------------------------------------------- Fourth Quarter Full Year -------------------------- -------------------------- 2006 2005 % Change 2006 2005 % Change ------- ------- --------- ------- ------- --------- Traditional Restaurants 32,458 31,901 +2 32,458 31,901 +2 System-Sales Growth +3% +7% NM +4% +7% NM Excluding 53rd Week +7% +4% NM +5% +6% NM Reported EPS $0.83 $0.77 +8 $2.92 $2.55 +14 Note: YUM has 34,595 restaurant locations around the world, which include 2,137 license units. David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased to report that in 2006 we again demonstrated the power of Yum! with our capability to consistently deliver double-digit EPS growth through our global portfolio of leading restaurant brands. We achieved strong EPS growth of 14%, led by continued profitable international growth, including nearly 400 new restaurants in our China Division, despite a disappointing fourth-quarter performance in the U.S. This marks the fifth straight year of delivering on our annual commitment of at least 10% EPS growth. "Importantly, we continued to return significant cash to shareholders in 2006 while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In fact, we returned $1.1 billion through share buy backs and dividends, making this the second straight year that we returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders. Additionally, this past December we announced the doubling of our quarterly dividend rate from $0.15 to $0.30 per share after initiating a dividend only two years ago. This new quarterly dividend rate is expected to generate an approximate 2% yield for our shareholders beginning in our second quarter 2007. "As we look ahead to our expectations for 2007, we remain confident we can continue to build on our track record of growing EPS at least 10% each year by generating 20% operating profit growth from our China Division, 10% from our YRI Division and 5% from our U.S. businesses. "Shareholders should expect us to continue building consistent value by focusing on executing YUM's unique growth opportunities -- building dominant restaurant brands in China, driving profitable international growth, improving U.S. brand positioning and returns, and driving high ROIC and strong shareholder payout -- that make us a global growth company and allow us to generate substantial free cash flow."

For the fourth quarter 2006, company sales for the China Division increased 23% in local-currency terms due to the continued strong expansion of both our KFC and Pizza Hut brands in mainland China. In particular, mainland China experienced strong fourth-quarter system-same-store-sales growth of 12%, and restaurant unit growth of 18%. Fourth-quarter 2006 reported operating profit increased 36% versus last year. The key contributing factor was continued sales growth in mainland China for both KFC and Pizza Hut. YUM!

The following discussion addresses 2006 performance on a like-for-like basis or without this benefit in 2005. Fourth-quarter 2006 operating profit increased 18% including the positive impact of foreign exchange. In addition, system-sales increased 11% in local currency terms, one of the best quarterly performances ever for the division. The key contributing factors were the strength of the franchise businesses around the world with strong same-store-sales growth of 7% and the recovery of the KFC U.K. business. Finally, YRI opened 333 and 785 new traditional restaurants for the fourth quarter and full year 2006 respectively, of which 90% were opened by franchisees. The acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership of the Pizza Hut U.K. joint venture from Whitbread was completed during the fourth quarter 2006, which impacted certain fourth-quarter and full-year financial measures. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and foreign exchange, the growth rates for the following fourth-quarter and full-year measures would have been: franchise fees, 13% and 13%, and company sales, +4% and even. Additionally, operating margin would have been 17.3% and 18.9% respectively.

The following discussion addresses 2006 performance on a like-for-like basis or without this benefit in 2005. For the fourth quarter, operating profit was lower by 8% primarily as a result of higher closure and impairment expenses. An additional factor was a 2% decline in blended company same-stores sales. The primary driver of the same-store sales decline was Taco Bell's decline of 5%, lapping a very strong +7% in the fourth quarter last year. This also reflects a very significant negative sales impact during the month of December from adverse publicity related to a produce-sourcing issue. The low point of the Taco Bell sales decline occurred during the third week of December, and sales have begun to recover from that point in time. Refranchising company restaurants negatively impacted fourth-quarter and full-year company-sales growth by 6 and 5 percentage points respectively. For the fourth quarter, franchise sales and fees grew as a result of the expansion of our franchise-restaurant base due to the sale of 452 company-owned restaurants to franchisees (refranchising) over the past year. TAX RATE The tax rates for the full year and fourth quarter, 2006 were better than anticipated. The low rate for the fourth quarter included the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular U.S. audit cycle, which we had communicated earlier this year, as well as other adjustments to prior years' accruals and reserves. U.S. FRANCHISE OWNERSHIP UPDATE As previously communicated during our analyst meeting on December 6, 2006, we extended our original two-year plan to sell approximately 1,000 company restaurants to franchisees during 2006 and 2007. Our current three-year plan, through 2008, is to sell approximately 1,500 company restaurants to franchisees, which will reduce company ownership to approximately 17% of the U.S. system. For the full year 2006, 452 company-owned U.S. restaurants were sold to our franchisees. Our latest estimate for 2007 is cash proceeds from U.S. refranchising of $200 million. Operating-profit impact for the U.S. in 2007, due to refranchising activities, is expected to be about neutral. Our three-year program is targeted to produce total cash proceeds of $550 to $600 million, improvements in restaurant margin and ROIC, and an approximate neutral impact on U.S. operating profit. FREE CASH FLOW For full-year 2006, we generated a record $1.3 billion in Cash from Operating Activities and invested $614 million in capital in our businesses. Additionally, we generated $456 million in cash from refranchising, stock option proceeds and sale of excess properties. As a result, total free cash available totaled over $1.1 billion. More importantly, all three of our reporting segments continue to generate free cash flow. In 2006, we again returned virtually all free cash available to our shareholders through share buy backs and quarterly dividends. Specifically, we returned a total of over $1.1 billion to our shareholders, that included significant share buy backs totaling $1.0 billion at an average price of $49.60, and $144 million returned through the quarterly dividends. For 2007, we expect similar total payout levels to our shareholders through both significant share buy backs and dividends. As we announced December 5, 2006, we have doubled our quarterly dividend for the second-quarter 2007 payment from $0.15 to $0.30 per share. YUM GROWTH MODEL AND 2007 OUTLOOK Earnings Growth Model: -- China Division operating-profit growth of 20%. This growth is driven largely by development in mainland China measured by 20% system-sales growth and 375 new-restaurant openings. -- YRI Division operating-profit growth of 10%. This growth is driven by system-sales growth of at least 5% (unit and same-store-sales growth), with 750 new-restaurant openings. -- U.S. operating-profit growth of 5%. This growth is driven by 2% to 3% same-store-sales growth. -- EPS growth of at least 10%. This assumes operating profit from our three lines of business as previously noted with additional benefit from the reduction in shares outstanding due to substantial share buy backs. Full-Year Outlook: -- Full-year 2007 EPS growth of at least 10%, or at least $3.21 per share. -- Profit growth from our combined international businesses is expected to be solidly double digit each quarter. In addition, full-year targeted U.S. sales and profit growth is expected to occur with solidly positive U.S. growth in the second half of 2007, offsetting a negative first quarter in the U.S. 2006 Fourth-Quarter End Dates 2007 First-Quarter End Dates - ---------------------------------- --------------------------------- International Division 12/4/2006 International Division 2/26/2007 China Division 12/31/2006 China Division 2/28/2007 U.S. Business 12/30/2006 U.S. Business 3/24/2007 CONFERENCE CALL Yum!

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (unaudited) (a) Percentages may not recompute due to rounding. (b) All periods presented reflect the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS 123R) effective September 4, 2005. The Company adopted SFAS 123R by applying the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of 2005, and as such the first three fiscal quarters of 2005 were adjusted to recognize the compensation cost for stock options previously reported only in the financial statement proforma footnote disclosures as required by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation". (c) Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year to date ended December 30, 2006 are preliminary. (d) Foreign currency translation impacted the YRI Division's operating profit by a positive $2 million in the quarter ended December 30, 2006 and by a negative $1 million in the year to date ended December 30, 2006. Foreign currency translation positively impacted the China Division's operating profit by $2 million and $8 million in the quarter and year to date ended December 30, 2006, respectively. (e) The effective tax rate for the year to date ended December 30, 2006 was lower than originally forecasted due to the net impact of several non-recurring items. The most significant of these items included out-of-year adjustments to reserves and accruals (which lowered our effective tax rate by approximately 2 percentage points) and a state tax law change that resulted in the loss of certain net operating loss carryforwards (which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 1 percentage point). (f) Other (income) expense primarily includes equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. In the year to date ended December 30, 2006, other (income) expense also includes an $8 million charge associated with the termination of a beverage agreement in the United States segment recorded as other expense in the first quarter of 2006. In the quarter and year to date ended December 31, 2005, other (income) expense also includes a partial financial recovery of $10 million and $24 million, respectively, related to a China supplier ingredient issue. In the year to date ended December 31, 2005, other (income) expense also includes an $11 million gain associated with the IPO of our Poland/Czech Republic business, including a $6 million adjustment to the previously recorded gain in the quarter ended December 31, 2005. (g) During the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our Pizza Hut United Kingdom ("PH UK") unconsolidated affiliate. This unconsolidated affiliate owned over 500 restaurants in the United Kingdom. Prior to this acquisition, we accounted for our interest under the equity method. From the acquisition date of September 12, 2006 through December 4, 2006 (the end of the fiscal year for PH UK), our financial statements are presented consolidating the PH UK's results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 30, 2006 now reflects the individual assets and liabilities of the PH UK, including the results of our initial purchase price allocation, as opposed to the investment in unconsolidated affiliate that was previously presented. As a result of this acquisition, company sales and restaurant profit increased $164 million and $16 million, respectively, franchise fees decreased $7 million and general and administrative expenses increased $8 million compared to the quarter and year to date ended December 31, 2005. The impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant. CONTACT: Yum! Brands, Inc.
