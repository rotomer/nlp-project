Exhibit 99.1 Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports Strong First-Quarter 2007 EPS Growth of 19% or $0.70 Per Share, Led by Powerful Growth in China and International Divisions; Raises Full-Year Forecast LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 1, 2007--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 24, 2007. Highlights for the first quarter are . . . -- Worldwide operating profit increased 12%. -- Strong double-digit operating-profit growth from our international divisions: China, +31%, and YRI, +25%. -- Mainland China restaurant unit growth of 19%. -- China Division restaurant margin improved 1.1%. -- Yum! Restaurants International Division (YRI) unit growth of 4%, the seventeenth consecutive quarter of at least 3% year-over-year unit growth, our ongoing growth target. -- Average diluted shares outstanding were reduced by 4%, the eleventh consecutive quarter with year-over-year share reduction. Note: All preceding comparisons are versus the same period a year ago. FULL-YEAR 2007 OUTLOOK We have raised our full-year EPS outlook to at least 11% growth or $3.23 based on the continued strong growth from our China and YRI divisions. The company's prior EPS guidance for 2007 was at least 10% growth or $3.21 per share. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS First Quarter ------------------------- 2007 2006 % Change ------- ------- --------- Traditional Restaurants 32,558 31,963 +2 System-Sales Growth +4% +5% NM Reported EPS $0.70 $0.59 +19 Note: YUM has 34,692 restaurant locations around the world, which include 2,134 license units. David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased to report a strong start to 2007 with first-quarter EPS growth of 19%, led again by very strong operating-profit growth from our China (+31%) and YRI (+25%) divisions. We delivered this great performance in the face of two negative and unforeseen incidents at Taco Bell, which shows the tremendous earnings power of our company. In fact, we are raising our full-year EPS forecast to 11% growth or $3.23 per share from 10%. "Our international businesses continue to generate strong consistent growth. We fully expect in 2007, for the seventh straight year, to open at least 1,000 new restaurants outside the U.S., which makes us the leading international developer in the retail category. Our proven capability of generating global growth with high returns and substantial free cash flow gives us confidence to report that we are on track to deliver another year of solid financial performance for our shareholders. "The two incidents at Taco Bell resulted in adverse publicity and had the most significant impact on U.S. performance. We have taken immediate actions (detailed in the U.S. Business section) to address both incidents. We expect that the enduring strength of our brands and the plans we have in place will enable us to be back on track for improved U.S. performance during the second half of 2007. "In summary, we expect to once again beat our target of at least 10% EPS growth for the sixth straight year based on the strength of our unique global portfolio and continuing to execute our four key strategies: building dominant restaurant brands in China, driving profitable international growth, improving U.S. brand positioning and returns, and driving high ROIC and strong shareholder payout."

For the first quarter 2007, company sales for the China Division increased 18% in local-currency terms due to continued strong unit expansion of KFC and Pizza Hut in mainland China as well as strong same-store-sales growth in mainland China of 9%. First-quarter 2007 reported operating profit increased 31% versus last year including the positive impact of foreign exchange. The key contributing factors were sales growth and continued development in mainland China for both KFC and Pizza Hut. Additionally, with this strong performance, the restaurant margin improved 1.1 percentage points. YUM! RESTAURANTS INTERNATIONAL DIVISION (YRI) First Quarter ($ million, except restaurant counts % and percentages) Change -------------- Excl 2007 2006 Reported F/x ------- ------- -------- ----- Key Financial Measures System-Sales Growth +13 +10 Franchise & License Fees 121 110 +10 +8 Franchisee Sales 2,186 2,071 +6 +4 Company Sales 560 359 +56 +50 Operating Margin % 17.4 20.1 (2.7) (2.4) Operating Profit 119 95 +25 +23 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Development Metrics Traditional Restaurants 11,791 11,378 +4 NA KFC 6,610 6,273 +5 NA Pizza Hut 4,712 4,642 +2 NA Franchise Restaurants 9,483 8,926 +6 NA First-quarter 2007 operating profit for YRI increased 25% including the positive impact of foreign exchange. System-sales increased 10% in local currency terms, one of the best quarterly performances ever for the division. In particular the KFC brand delivered strong system-sales growth of 13% in local currency terms with strong performances across our KFC franchise markets as well as our KFC U.K. business. Overall, the vast majority of our YRI markets generated solid same-store-sales growth (+7% for the system), and we are continuing to add new KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants around the world through franchise development. YRI opened 144 new traditional restaurants for the first quarter 2007, of which 94% were opened by franchisees. Note: Excluding the impact of the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership of the Pizza Hut U.K. joint venture from Whitbread, the percentage change for the following financial measures in local currency terms is estimated to have been: % Change - -- Franchise & License Fees +13 - -- Franchisee Sales +11 - -- Company Sales +2 - -- Operating Margin % +3.6 pts - -- Operating Profit +23 UNITED STATES BUSINESS First Quarter ($ million, except restaurant counts and percentages) 2007 2006 % Change ------- ------- --------- Key Financial Measures Blended Same-Store-Sales Growth % Company (6) +4 NM System (3) +5 NM Franchisee Sales 2,932 2,912 +1 Company Sales 1,051 1,191 (12) Franchise & License Fees 149 148 +1 Restaurant Margin % 13.3 15.0 (1.7) Operating Margin % 13.8 14.0 (0.2) Operating Profit 165 188 (11) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Development Metrics Total Traditional Restaurants 18,050 18,231 (1) System Multibrand Restaurants 3,474 3,160 +10 Franchise Restaurants 13,964 13,630 +2 For the first quarter, U.S. operating profit decreased 11% versus last year primarily due to a 6% decline in blended company same-store sales. The primary driver was Taco Bell, which lapped a very strong +8% in same-store-sales growth last year while dealing with two recent incidents that severely impacted first-quarter performance, resulting in a decline of 11% in first quarter same-store-sales growth at Taco Bell. However, our franchisees in general are doing better. U.S. system-same-store sales, which include franchisees, declined 3% versus company-only results of a 6% decline. Company sales declined 12% for the first quarter, 8% of the reduction was due to refranchising: converting company ownership to franchise, which changes the source of revenue from these restaurants to franchisee fees. For the first quarter, franchise sales and fees grew as a result of the expansion of our franchise-restaurant base due to the sale of 482 company-owned restaurants to franchisees (refranchising) over the past four quarters. In the first quarter of 2007, 105 U.S. restaurants were refranchised. UPDATES ON INCIDENTS AFFECTING U.S. BUSINESS Produce-Supply Incident at Taco Bell: In early December 2006, Taco Bell was linked to an E. coli issue associated with lettuce supplied to our restaurants in four Northeastern states. We immediately addressed the situation, and the outbreak was declared over by health authorities by mid-December. The company took swift action to remove and replace all produce from the affected restaurants with new ingredients from a new supplier. We provided regular updates to the public as and when new information became available and worked closely with all local, state, and federal health authorities to ensure the safety of our food and assist those who became ill. We have taken a number of added precautions since that time. In addition to the strict testing already conducted by our produce suppliers, we have since begun requiring that lettuce be tested at the farm before it even enters our supply chain. This new industry testing should benefit all purchasers of lettuce, not just our company, and our goal is to expand this to other produce as well. We also sponsored an industry symposium with the National Restaurant Association to discuss ways to strengthen the produce supply chain, and have proactively met with congressional leaders to improve federal food safety standards. Infestation Incident at a KFC-Taco Bell Restaurant in New York City: In February of 2007, a KFC-Taco Bell restaurant in New York City became the subject of much adverse publicity as our franchisee attempted to resolve a rodent infestation issue at this Greenwich Village area restaurant. After the restaurant had been closed at the end of the day, a construction crew attempted to eliminate the problem, but unfortunately this only made the matter worse as the job was left unfinished for completion the next day. While the restaurant was closed, a video of the infestation was made and subsequently circulated on the Internet and throughout the news media. This had a negative impact on each brand, particularly on Taco Bell since it had just begun to recover from the previously discussed produce-supply issue in the region. Since the incident, this KFC-Taco Bell restaurant has been closed for business, and it will not reopen. Our Food Safety Council is using this incident to review and further strengthen our strict pest control standards in challenging urban environments such as New York City. To assist us, we hired Dr. Bobby Corrigan, a noted expert in pest control, to conduct an exhaustive and objective review of our process and to make further recommendations for improvements. We expect to review those recommendations by mid-May. We are determined to prevent this incident from happening again. U.S. FRANCHISE OWNERSHIP UPDATE Our current three-year U.S. refranchising plan, through 2008, is to sell approximately 1,500 company restaurants to franchisees, which will increase U.S. franchise ownership to approximately 83% of the system (17% company ownership) from 77% today. Since the beginning of 2006, a total of 557 company-owned U.S. restaurants were sold to franchisees, including 105 U.S. restaurants in the first quarter 2007. FREE CASH FLOW UPDATE For 2007, we expect to again return over $1 billion to shareholders through both significant share buy backs and dividends. This would be the third consecutive year that we have returned more than 100% of the company's net income to our shareholders. As we announced December 5, 2006, we doubled our quarterly dividend with the second-quarter 2007 payment from $0.15 previously to $0.30 per share. During the first-quarter 2007, we purchased 3.9 million shares at an average purchase price of $59.04. FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS (operating profit $ million) 2007 Division First Quarter ------------- YRI +2 China +3 YUM GROWTH MODEL AND 2007 OUTLOOK Long-Term Earnings Growth Model: -- China Division operating-profit growth of 20%. This growth is driven largely by new-unit development in mainland China. Our key metric is system-sales growth and our target is 20% driven by 375 new-restaurant openings. -- YRI Division operating-profit growth of 10%. This growth is driven mainly by new-unit development measured by system-sales growth of at least 5% (at least 3% unit growth and 2% to 3% same-store-sales growth) with 750 new-restaurant openings. -- U.S. operating-profit growth of 5% with same-store-sales growth of +2 to +3% and leverage of the G&A infrastructure. -- EPS growth of at least 10%. This assumes operating profit performance from our three lines of business as previously noted with additional benefit from reduction in shares outstanding due to substantial share buy backs. Full-Year 2007 Outlook: -- EPS growth is increased to at least 11%, or at least $3.23 per share, from prior EPS guidance of at least $3.21 or 10% growth. -- China and YRI Divisions' operating-profit growth is expected to at least meet the targets set forth in the long-term earnings growth model. -- U.S. operating profit growth is expected to be positive but lower than the long-term earnings growth model target. 2007 First-Quarter End Dates 2007 Second-Quarter End Dates - ------------------------------------ --------------------------------- International Division 2/26/2007 International Division 5/21/2007 China Division 2/28/2007 China Division 5/31/2007 U.S. Business 3/24/2007 U.S. Business 6/16/2007 CONFERENCE CALL Yum!

(d) During the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our Pizza Hut United Kingdom ("PHUK") unconsolidated affiliate. This unconsolidated affiliate owned over 500 restaurants in the United Kingdom. Prior to this acquisition, we accounted for our interest under the equity method. In 2007, our financial statements are presented consolidating the PHUK's results of operations and cash flows. As a result of this acquisition, company sales and restaurant profit increased $173 million and $18 million, respectively, franchise fees decreased $7 million and general and administrative expenses increased $9 million compared to the quarter ended March 25, 2006. The impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant. Operating results for our PHUK business in the quarter ended March 24, 2007 include approximately $3.5 million in closures and impairment expenses.
