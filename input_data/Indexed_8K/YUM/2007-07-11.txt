Exhibit 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports Strong Second-Quarter 2007 EPS Growth of 15% or $0.39 Per Share, Led by Consistent Growth in China and International Divisions Raises Full-Year EPS Growth Forecast to 12% from 11% LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 11, 2007--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 16, 2007. Note: Unless otherwise noted, all earnings per share (EPS) figures discussed in this release are on a split-adjusted basis, giving effect to the two-for-one stock split on June 26, 2007. Highlights for the second quarter are... -- Worldwide system-same-store sales grew by 2%, including 7% growth in mainland China, 5% growth in Yum! Restaurants International Division (YRI), and flat results in the U.S. -- Strong double-digit system-sales growth from both our international businesses: China Division, +25%; YRI, +15%. -- Mainland China restaurant unit growth of 19%. -- YRI unit growth of 4%, the eighteenth consecutive quarter of at least 3% year-over-year unit growth, our ongoing growth target. -- Double-digit operating-profit growth from our international divisions: China, +14%, and YRI, +15%. -- Average diluted shares outstanding were reduced by 3%, the twelfth consecutive quarter with year-over-year share reduction as a result of substantial share buybacks. -- An overall effective tax rate of 21.5%, which was 7.5 percentage points lower than last year's. Note: All preceding comparisons are versus the same period a year ago. FULL-YEAR 2007 OUTLOOK We have raised our full-year EPS growth forecast to 12% from 11% based on the continued strong growth from our China and YRI divisions. The new full-year EPS forecast is $1.63 per share. (Previously, our guidance, pre-split, was for full-year EPS of $3.23. It is now 3 cents higher at $3.26 on the "pre-split" basis. The two-for-one stock split was effective on June 26, 2007.) CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year To Date ----------------------- ----------------------- 2007 2006 %Change 2007 2006 %Change ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- Traditional Restaurants 32,708 32,022 +2 32,708 32,022 +2 System-Sales Growth +7% +5% NM +6% +5% NM Reported EPS $0.39 $0.34 +15 $0.74 $0.64 +17 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: YUM has 34,820 restaurant locations around the world, which include 2,112 license units. David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased to report that robust second-quarter sales in both our China and YRI divisions, coupled with a reduction in our tax rate, helped drive strong EPS growth of 15%. This quarter demonstrated once again the tremendous growth potential of our global portfolio. In fact, we are raising our full-year EPS growth rate, now +12% from +11%. "Our mainland China business continues to generate strong top-line growth with same-store-sales growth of +7%, while we are well on our way to opening another 375 new restaurants for 2007. Furthermore, our YRI Division had one of its best quarterly performances ever, delivering system-sales growth of 11% and is on pace to open 800 new YRI restaurants in 2007. This global growth will contribute to Yum! Brands' seventh straight year of opening at least 1,000 new restaurants outside the U.S. Importantly, we anticipate this pace of development will be maintained into the future, reinforcing our position as the leading international retail developer. "In the U.S., we are making steady progress toward a full recovery with improving sales results across our brands in the second quarter. We continue to expect to generate positive growth in our second-half results after a first-half decline in sales and profits. Overall for the U.S., we expect full-year operating profit growth to be slightly positive. "There is no question that we are continuing to build our strong global brand positions and demonstrate our track record for consistency in spite of a challenging global environment from commodity inflation. In summary, this will be the sixth straight year that we demonstrate the strength of our global portfolio to beat our target of at least 10% EPS growth. We expect to continue generating substantial free cash flow in 2007, which allows us to return to our shareholders another $1 billion through share buybacks, which will reduce our reported share count by at least 3%. We are also providing a meaningful dividend currently with a yield of nearly 2%. The key factor behind these consistent results is the undeniable strength of our global portfolio. Our shareholders should expect us to build on our strong global position by continuing to execute our four key strategies: (1) Build dominant restaurant brands in China; (2) Drive profitable international expansion; (3) Improve U.S. brand positioning and returns; and (4) Drive high ROIC and strong shareholder payout."

For the second quarter and year to date, China Division results were driven by strong system-sales growth from continued broad development of our brands in terms of both unit expansion and same-store-sales growth in mainland China. This is represented by 22% growth of system sales in local currency for the second quarter and 23% for the year to date. For the second quarter, same-store-sales growth in mainland China was a strong 7%. Second-quarter 2007 reported operating profit for mainland China increased 20% with same-store-sales growth and continued new-unit development for both KFC and Pizza Hut as the key contributing factors. Reported operating profit for the China Division overall increased 14% versus last year, as weak performances in our Thailand and KFC Taiwan markets impacted the division's growth rate. Increased levels of commodity inflation for some food ingredients, including chicken and higher labor costs moderated the overall growth of operating profit and resulted in a decline in restaurant margin. We expect these factors to continue, with the rate of commodity inflation expected to increase during the second half of 2007. YUM!

In particular, the KFC brand delivered strong system-sales growth of 14% in local currency terms with strong performances across our franchise markets as well as our KFC U.K. business. Overall, the vast majority of our YRI markets generated solid same-store-sales growth, +5% for the system, and we are continuing to add new KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants around the world primarily through franchise development. YRI opened 178 new traditional restaurants for the second quarter 2007 and 322 year to date, of which 93% were opened by franchisees. Second-quarter 2007 operating profit for YRI increased 15% including the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Restaurant margin declined slightly primarily due to the inclusion of our Pizza Hut U.K. business as a company-owned business this year. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of our Pizza Hut U.K. business, restaurant and operating margins would have increased by 0.9 and 0.7 percentage points respectively. UNITED STATES BUSINESS - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter Year To Date ($ million, except restaurant counts and percentages) 2007 2006 %Change 2007 2006 %Change ------- ------ -------- ------- ------ -------- Key Financial Measures Blended Same-Store- Sales Growth% Company (3) Even NM (5) +2 NM System Even +1 NM (2) +3 NM Franchisee Sales 3,097 2,967 +4 6,029 5,879 +3 Company Sales 1,060 1,179 (10) 2,111 2,370 (11) Franchise & License Fees 158 151 +5 307 299 +3 Restaurant Margin% 15.3 16.1 (0.8) 14.3 15.5 (1.2) Operating Profit 191 194 (2) 356 382 (7) Operating Margin% 15.6 14.6 1.0 14.7 14.3 0.4 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Development Metrics Total Traditional Restaurants 18,021 18,164 (1) 18,021 18,164 (1) System Multibrand Restaurants 3,518 3,224 +9 3,518 3,224 +9 Franchise Restaurants 13,984 13,603 +3 13,984 13,603 +3 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- For the second quarter, U.S. system-same-store sales, which includes franchisees' sales, were flat versus prior year as positive franchise performance offset a 3% decline for company restaurants. The primary driver of the 3% decline in company same-store-sales was a decline of 7% at Taco Bell. For the second quarter, franchise sales and fees grew as a result of the expansion of our franchise-restaurant base due to the sale of 492 company-owned restaurants to franchisees (refranchising) over the past four quarters. In the second quarter of 2007, 42 U.S. restaurants were refranchised, resulting in a shift of revenues from Company Sales to Franchise Fees. Company sales decreased by 10% in the second quarter, with 8% of that reduction due to refranchising; commensurately, franchisee fees grew by 5%. For the second quarter, U.S. operating profit decreased 2% versus last year due to a decline in restaurant margin. Furthermore, restaurant margin declined primarily due to higher commodity and labor costs, as well as operating deleverage from a drop in company same-store sales. These factors were partially offset by lower insurance expenses. For the full year 2007, we expect U.S. operating profit growth to be slightly positive based on improved second-half performance. U.S. REFRANCHISE PLAN UPDATE Our current three-year U.S. refranchising plan, through 2008, is to sell approximately 1,500 company restaurants to franchisees, which will increase U.S. franchise ownership to approximately 83% of the system from 78% today. This will reduce the number of U.S. company-owned restaurants from over 4,686, at the start of this program in 2006, to approximately 3,200 by year-end 2008, a reduction of more than 30% in restaurant count. This is a result of our regular review of company operations and our "Earn the Right to Own" principle. Since the beginning of 2006, a total of 599 company-owned U.S. restaurants were sold to franchisees, including 42 U.S. restaurants in the second quarter 2007. FREE CASH FLOW UPDATE For 2007, we expect to again return over $1 billion to shareholders through both significant share buybacks and dividends. This would be the third consecutive year that we have returned more than 100% of the company's net income to our shareholders. As announced December 5, 2006, we doubled our quarterly dividend with the second-quarter 2007 payment. During the second-quarter 2007, we purchased 7.2 million shares at an average split-adjusted purchase price of $31.97, or a total of $231 million. FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (operating profit $ million) 2007 Division Second Quarter Year To Date ------------------------------------------ YRI +4 +6 China +3 +6 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- YUM ONGOING EARNINGS GROWTH MODEL -- China Division operating-profit growth of 20%. This growth is driven largely by new-unit development in mainland China. Our key metric for mainland China is system-sales growth with an annual target of +20% driven by at least 375 new-restaurant openings. -- YRI Division operating-profit growth of 10%. This growth is driven mainly by new-unit development measured by system-sales growth of at least 5% (at least 3% unit growth and 2% to 3% same-store-sales growth) including 750 new-restaurant openings. -- U.S. operating-profit growth of 5% with same-store-sales growth of +2% to +3% and leverage of the G&A infrastructure. -- EPS growth of at least 10%. This assumes operating profit performance from our three lines of business as previously noted with additional benefit from reduction in shares outstanding due to substantial share buybacks. FULL-YEAR 2007 UPDATE -- EPS growth is increased to at least 12%, or at least $1.63 per share, from prior EPS guidance of at least $1.62 or 11% growth (split-adjusted). -- China Division's operating profit growth is expected to be 20%, driven by higher than expected revenue growth partially offset by higher commodity and labor costs. -- YRI Division's operating-profit growth is expected to meet or exceed the targets set forth in the long-term earnings growth model. -- U.S. operating profit growth is expected to be slightly positive driven by better results during the second half of 2007.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (unaudited) (a) Percentages may not recompute due to rounding. (b) Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year to date ended June 16, 2007 are preliminary. (c) On May 17, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock. The stock split was effected in the form of a stock dividend and entitled each shareholder of record at the close of business on June 1, 2007 to receive one additional share for every outstanding share of Common Stock held. The stock dividend was distributed on June 26, 2007, with approximately 261 million shares of Common Stock distributed. All per share and share amounts in the accompanying Consolidated Summary of Results and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets have been adjusted to reflect the stock split. (d) Other (income) expense primarily includes equity income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates in our China and International Divisions. In the quarter ended March 24, 2007, other (income) expense also included recognition of income of $5 million associated with receipt of payment for a note receivable arising from the 2005 sale of our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all KFCs and Pizza Huts in Poland and the Czech Republic to our then partner in the entity. In the quarter ended March 25, 2006, other (income) expense also included an $8 million charge associated with the termination of a beverage agreement in the United States segment. (e) During the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our Pizza Hut United Kingdom ("PHUK") unconsolidated affiliate. This unconsolidated affiliate owned over 500 restaurants in the United Kingdom. Prior to this acquisition, we accounted for our interest under the equity method. In 2007, our financial statements are presented consolidating the PHUK's results of operations and cash flows. As a result of this acquisition, Company sales increased $164 million and $337 million, restaurant profit increased $15 million and $33 million, franchise fees decreased $6 million and $12 million and general and administrative expenses increased $9 million and $19 million compared to the quarter and year to date ended June 17, 2006, respectively. The impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant. CONTACT: Yum! Brands Inc.
