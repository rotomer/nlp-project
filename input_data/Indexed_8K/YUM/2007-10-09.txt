EXHIBIT 99.1 Yum! Brands Inc. Reports Strong Third-Quarter 2007 EPS Growth of 20% or $0.50 Per Share; Raises Full-Year EPS Growth Forecast to 13% from 12%; Plans $4 Billion in Share Repurchases Over Next Two Years LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 8, 2007--Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 8, 2007. THIRD-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS -- Worldwide system-same-store-sales growth of 4%, including 11% growth in mainland China, 7% growth in Yum! Restaurants International Division (YRI), and 1% growth in the U.S. -- Strong double-digit system-sales growth from mainland China, +33%, and YRI, +16%. -- Continued strong international restaurant unit growth: mainland China, +20%; YRI, +4%, the nineteenth consecutive quarter of at least 3% year-over-year YRI unit growth, our ongoing growth target. -- Strong worldwide operating-profit growth of +16% led by our international divisions: China, +28%, and YRI, +21%. -- Worldwide operating margin improved by 0.5 percentage point to 15.6%. -- Average diluted shares outstanding reduced by 2%, the thirteenth consecutive quarter with year-over-year share reduction as a result of substantial share buybacks. Over the past three years, the company's regular share-repurchase program has reduced share count by a net 12%. -- Favorable foreign currency conversion impact of about $0.02 EPS. Note: All preceding comparisons are versus the same period a year ago unless noted. FULL-YEAR 2007 OUTLOOK We have raised our full-year EPS growth forecast to 13% from 12% based on the continued strong growth from our China and YRI divisions. The new full-year EPS forecast is $1.65 per share. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Third Quarter Year To Date ---------------------- ---------------------- 2007 2006 % Change 2007 2006 % Change ------ ------ -------- ------ ------ -------- Traditional Restaurants 32,858 32,146 +2 32,858 32,146 +2 System-Sales Growth +9% +5% NM +7% +5% NM Reported EPS $0.50 $0.42 +20 $1.24 $1.05 +18 Note: Yum! has 34,917 restaurant locations around the world, which include 2,059 license units. David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased that we were once again able to demonstrate the power of our global portfolio to generate consistent growth. Driven by outstanding operating performance in our international businesses, China and YRI, we were able to deliver 16% growth in operating profit and 20% EPS growth for the third quarter. "Strong unit expansion and same-store-sales growth led to system-sales growth well above our ongoing target for both our mainland China business and YRI. Our U.S. business performance improved versus the first half of the year; however, sales and profit growth remains below our target level due to results at Taco Bell. For the fourth quarter, we expect improved Taco Bell results, solid U.S. profit growth, and strong overall profit growth from the Yum! global portfolio. This would cap off a year of very strong operating performance by our company, especially given the challenge of heightened inflation pressure in several key markets. As a result of our confidence in our business, we are raising our full-year forecast for EPS growth from 12% to 13% or $1.65 per share. "Importantly, we believe the strong free cash flow generated by all three of our businesses enables us to increase our leverage while achieving our target of remaining an investment-grade company. As a result, we intend to increase our debt level in the near term and dramatically increase our already strong pace of share buybacks. We expect to increase shareholder value by investing up to $4 billion in share repurchases by the end of 2009. This will substantially reduce the number of shares outstanding, potentially by up to 20%, adding to the 12% reduction we have achieved during the past three years. This further showcases our financial strength in a year in which we doubled our quarterly dividend. "We expect this year will mark our sixth straight year of exceeding our +10% annual EPS growth target and look to continue to build on this track record in 2008 by executing against our four key strategies: (1) Building dominant restaurant brands in China; (2) Driving profitable international expansion at YRI; (3) Improving U.S. brand positioning and returns; and (4) Driving high ROIC and strong shareholder payout."

Our mainland China business generated +26% growth of system sales for the third quarter and 24% year to date, both in local currency terms. Operating profit for China Division increased 28% in the third quarter, led by 29% growth in mainland China, including the favorable impact of foreign currency conversion for both measures. Strong top-line growth as noted above was the key factor. Restaurant margin declined slightly in the third quarter and year to date due to increased levels of inflation for key food ingredients and labor costs in mainland China. We expect these inflation factors to be more significant for the fourth quarter, resulting in up to a two-percentage-point decline in restaurant margin versus last year for the fourth quarter. YUM! RESTAURANTS INTERNATIONAL DIVISION (YRI) Third Quarter Year To Date ($ million, % % except Change Change restaurant -------------- -------------- counts and Excl Excl percentages) 2007 2006 Reported F/x 2007 2006 Reported F/x ------ ------ -------- ----- ------ ------ -------- ----- Key Financial Measures System-Sales Growth +16 +11 +15 +10 Franchise & License Fees 137 119 +15 +9 380 337 +13 +9 Franchisee Sales 2,393 2,187 +9 +5 6,764 6,284 +8 +5 Company Sales 603 399 +51 +44 1,737 1,139 +53 +46 Operating Margin % 17.2 20.2 (3.0) (3.2) 16.4 19.5 (3.1) (3.1) Operating Profit 127 105 +21 +14 347 288 +21 +16 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Financial Measures Excluding Impact from Pizza Hut U.K. Acquisition (September 2006) Company Sales +6 Even +7 +1 Operating Profit +17 +10 +19 +15 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Development Metrics Traditional Restaurants 11,993 11,551 +4 NA 11,993 11,551 +4 NA KFC 6,760 6,410 +5 NA 6,760 6,410 +5 NA Pizza Hut 4,753 4,673 +2 NA 4,753 4,673 +2 NA Franchise Restaurants 9,732 9,167 +6 NA 9,732 9,167 +6 NA - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- System-sales increased 11% for the third quarter in local currency terms, another outstanding performance for the division. In particular, the KFC brand performed very well with system-sales growth of 15% in local currency terms led by strong performances around the globe. Overall for YRI, system-same-store-sales growth was +7%. Importantly, we are continuing to add new KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants around the world primarily through franchise development. YRI opened 193 new traditional restaurants during the third quarter 2007 and 515 year to date, of which 92% were opened by franchisees. For the full-year 2007, YRI is expected to break the previous record set in 2003 by opening over 850 new restaurants. Third-quarter operating profit for YRI increased +21% including the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Restaurant margin declined slightly primarily due to the inclusion of Pizza Hut U.K. as a company-owned business this year. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Pizza Hut U.K., restaurant and operating margins would have increased by 0.7 and 1.4 percentage points respectively. UNITED STATES BUSINESS Third Quarter Year To Date ($ million, except restaurant counts and percentages) 2007 2006 % Change 2007 2006 % Change ------ ------ -------- ------ ------ -------- Key Financial Measures Blended Same-Store-Sales Growth % Company (1) (2) NM (3) Even NM System +1 (2) NM (1) +1 NM Franchisee Sales 3,215 3,048 +5 9,244 8,927 +4 Company Sales 1,059 1,145 (8) 3,170 3,515 (10) Franchise & License Fees 165 155 +6 472 454 +4 Restaurant Margin % 13.0 14.1 (1.1) 13.9 15.1 (1.2) Operating Profit 187 183 +1 543 565 (4) Operating Margin % 15.2 14.2 +1.0 14.9 14.2 +0.7 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Development Metrics Total Traditional Restaurants 17,999 18,120 (1) 17,999 18,120 (1) System Multibrand Restaurants 3,565 3,277 +9 3,565 3,277 +9 Franchise Restaurants 14,029 13,662 +3 14,029 13,662 +3 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In the third quarter, system-same-store sales, which includes franchisees' sales, grew by 1% versus prior year as growth in franchise performance offset a 1% decline for company restaurants. The primary driver of the 1% decline in company same-store sales was a decline of 6% at Taco Bell. For the third quarter, franchise sales and fees grew primarily as a result of the expansion of our franchise-restaurant base due to the sale of 479 company-owned restaurants to franchisees (refranchising) over the past four quarters. In the third quarter, 71 U.S. restaurants were refranchised, resulting in a shift of revenues from Company Sales to Franchise Fees. Company sales decreased by 8% in the third quarter, primarily due to refranchising; commensurately, franchise fees grew by 6%. Third-quarter operating profit increased 1% primarily due to lower G&A expense. Restaurant margin for company restaurants declined primarily due to higher commodity costs ($16 million) and wage rates partially offset by increase in average guest check, which includes menu price increase. For the full year 2007, we expect U.S. system-same-store sales and operating profit to be essentially even with last year. U.S. REFRANCHISE PLAN UPDATE Our current three-year U.S. refranchising plan, through 2008, is to sell approximately 1,500 company restaurants to franchisees, which will increase U.S. franchise ownership to approximately 83% of the system from 78% today. This will reduce the number of U.S. company-owned restaurants from 4,686, at the start of this program in 2006, to approximately 3,200 by year-end 2008, a reduction of more than 30% in restaurant count. This is a result of our regular review of company operations and our "Earn the Right to Own" principle. Since the beginning of 2006, a total of 670 company-owned U.S. restaurants were sold to franchisees, including 218 U.S. restaurants year to date in 2007. FREE CASH FLOW USAGE UPDATE For 2007, we expect to again return over $1 billion to shareholders through both significant share buybacks and dividends. This would be the third consecutive year that we have returned more than 100% of the company's net income to our shareholders. As announced December 5, 2006, we doubled our quarterly dividend beginning with the second-quarter 2007 payment. During the third quarter 2007, we purchased 10.6 million shares at an average purchase price of $32.61, or a total of $344 million. For the year through October 5, 2007, we have purchased 29.7 million shares at an average purchase price of $31.80, or a total of $943 million. NEW SHARE-REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION The company's board of directors today authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.25 billion of the company's outstanding common stock under our share-repurchase program, either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, over a period of 12 months. In March 2007, the board authorized repurchases up to $500 million of the company's stock. As of October 5, 2007, we had approximately $25 million remaining under the March 2007 share-repurchase authorization. This authorization is part of the company's overall plan to substantially increase the amount of share buybacks over the next two years, buying back a total of up to $4 billion of the company's outstanding common stock, reducing our share count further, by as much as 20%. We expect this two-year share-repurchase program will be funded by a combination of the company's ongoing free cash flow, additional debt and refranchising proceeds. The completion of this plan will depend on the company's cash flows, credit rating, proceeds from our refranchising efforts and availability of other investment opportunities, among other factors. FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS (operating profit $ million) 2007 Division Third Quarter Year To Date -------------------------- YRI +7 +13 China +8 +13 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FULL-YEAR 2007 UPDATE -- EPS growth of at least 13% or $1.65 per share. -- Yum! Brands fourth-quarter operating profit growth is expected to be in the range of 8% to 10%; however, due to lapping a record low Q4 2006 quarterly tax rate of 17.1%, we expect the fourth-quarter 2007 EPS growth to be negative. -- China Division's operating-profit growth is expected to be over 20%, driven by higher-than-expected revenue growth offset by higher commodity and labor costs. -- YRI Division's operating-profit growth is expected to exceed 15%. -- U.S. operating profit is expected to be even with the prior year, with better results during the second half of 2007. YUM! ONGOING EARNINGS GROWTH MODEL -- China Division operating-profit growth of 20%. This growth is driven largely by new-unit development in mainland China. Our key metric for mainland China is system-sales growth with an annual target of +20% driven by at least 375 new-restaurant openings. -- YRI Division operating-profit growth of 10%. This growth is driven mainly by new-unit development, measured by system-sales growth of at least 5% (at least 3% unit growth and 2% to 3% same-store-sales growth) including 750 new-restaurant openings. -- U.S. operating-profit growth of 5% with same-store-sales growth of +2% to +3% and leverage of the G&A infrastructure. -- EPS growth of at least 10%. This assumes operating profit performance from our three lines of business as previously noted with additional benefit from reduction in shares outstanding due to substantial share buybacks.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (amounts in millions, except per share amounts) (unaudited) (a) Percentages may not recompute due to rounding. (b) Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year to date ended September 8, 2007 are preliminary. (c) On May 17, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock. The stock split was effected in the form of a stock dividend and entitled each shareholder of record at the close of business on June 1, 2007 to receive one additional share for every outstanding share of Common Stock held. The stock dividend was distributed on June 26, 2007, with approximately 261 million shares of Common Stock distributed. All per share and share amounts in the accompanying Consolidated Summary of Results and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets have been adjusted to reflect the stock split. (d) Other (income) expense primarily includes equity income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates in our China and International Divisions. In the quarter ended March 24, 2007, other (income) expense also included recognition of income of $5 million associated with receipt of payment for a note receivable arising from the 2005 sale of our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all KFCs and Pizza Huts in Poland and the Czech Republic to our then partner in the entity. In the quarter ended March 25, 2006, other (income) expense also included an $8 million charge associated with the termination of a beverage agreement in the United States segment. (e) During the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our Pizza Hut United Kingdom ("PHUK") unconsolidated affiliate. This unconsolidated affiliate owned over 500 restaurants in the United Kingdom. Prior to this acquisition, we accounted for our interest under the equity method. In 2007, our financial statements are presented consolidating the PHUK's results of operations and cash flows. As a result of this acquisition, company sales increased $179 million and $516 million, restaurant profit increased $20 million and $53 million, franchise fees decreased $5 million and $17 million and general and administrative expenses increased $10 million and $29 million compared to the quarter and year to date ended September 9, 2006, respectively. The impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant. MULTIMEDIA AVAILABLE: http://www.businesswire.com/cgi-bin/mmg.cgi?eid=5511518 CONTACT: Yum! Brands, Inc.

EXHIBIT 99.2 NEWS Tim Jerzyk Senior Vice President, Investor Relations/Treasurer October 8, 2007 Yum! Brands' Full-Year 2007 Detailed Guidance Update Note: Further updates to guidance provided July 11, 2007 The company expects . . . o Worldwide reported system-sales growth of about 7% (from +5% to +6%): - Led by 25% (from 22%) growth in mainland China, local-currency basis; total China Division, including Thailand and KFC Taiwan, is expected to be about 22% (from +19% ), local-currency basis. - Yum! Restaurants International Division (YRI), at least +9% (from at least +7%), local-currency basis. - U.S., flat to up slightly. o Worldwide reported revenue growth of +8% to +9% (from +6% to +7%): - Led by at least 25% growth in mainland China, local-currency basis; total China Division, including Thailand and KFC Taiwan, is expected to be about +22% (from at least +19%), local-currency basis. - YRI, about 25% (from at least +20%), local-currency basis. The acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the Pizza Hut U.K. joint venture adds 20 percentage points of growth. In addition, YRI revenue growth previously noted includes the expected negative impact of 2006 and 2007 refranchising activities of approximately 6 percentage points as company sales are replaced by franchise royalties. - U.S., down 6% to 7%. Refranchising company restaurants in 2006 and 2007 negatively impacts U.S. revenue growth by 7 to 8 percentage points. o Over 1,600 (from nearly 1,600) new system restaurants to be opened worldwide: - Over 425 (from over 400) new China Division restaurants - Over 850 (from over 800) new YRI restaurants - 350 new U.S. restaurants o YRI net-restaurant expansion to be about 4% (from at least +3%). o The U.S. restaurant base is expected to decrease slightly versus 2006, reflecting +1% to +2% net new-unit growth for Taco Bell, which will be offset by net closures at our other brands. o U.S. blended same-store-sales growth at company restaurants down 2% (from flat to down slightly). o Growth in franchise fees of +9% (from +7%) resulting from worldwide restaurant expansion, same- store-sales growth, and refranchising in the U.S. and YRI. o Worldwide restaurant margin down slightly versus 2006 with declines expected in the U.S. and China divisions. o General and administrative costs will increase versus 2006 by +5% due to the continued investment in mainland China and acquisition of the Pizza Hut U.K. joint venture. The Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition adds about $30 million or 3 percentage points impact to YUM. o Interest expense will be up about $20 million (from $10 million) versus 2006. o Closure and impairment charges of $30 to $40 million. Refranchising gains are expected to be $0 to $15 million. Yum! Brands, Inc. o 1900 Colonel Sanders Lane o Louisville, KY 40213 Tel 502 874-8006 o Fax 502 874-8790 o Web Site www.yum.com
o Approximately $20 to $30 million positive impact from foreign currency conversion on operating profit for the full year. The Chinese renminbi, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Korean won, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and European euro are important currencies in the company's international businesses. o Operating profit growth: o China Division, over +20% (from +20%) driven by higher revenue growth partially offset by lower restaurant margin. o YRI, over 15% (from at least 10%) o U.S. even (from slightly positive). o Average shares outstanding of about 540 million split-adjusted shares, or about 4% (from at least a 3%) reduction. o Effective tax rate of 26% to 28%. o Return on invested capital to remain at about 18%. o Capital expenditures to be at least $650 million. Pretax refranchising and surplus PP&E proceeds of about $250 (from $300) million are expected, this may range as low as $200 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of transactions and the type of stores to be sold. o Additional refranchising in the U.S. will reduce company ownership in the U.S. to 20% of the U.S. system total by the end of 2007.
