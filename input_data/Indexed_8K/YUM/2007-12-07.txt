Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Yum! Brands Announces 2008 Expectations and Expanded U.S. Refranchising;
Hosts Annual Investor Update
 
Louisville, Ky. (December 6, 2007)
Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) announced today that for the full year 2008, it expects EPS growth of at least 10%, which would mark the seventh straight year the company will have met or exceeded its annual target of at least 10% EPS growth.
Yum! Brands also announced the expansion of its U.S. refranchising, targeting company ownership potentially below 10% by year-end 2010, down from approximately 20% at year-end 2007, dependent on market and other conditions. Additional information will be provided at the company's investor update meeting on December 12.
Our four key strategies remain unchanged and are the key drivers of our record of consistency, global growth, and strong global cash generation. We expect to build on this track record in 2008 by continuing to execute against each of these strategies as outlined below:
 
 
 
John Silver's. The actual timing and level of refranchising will be dependent on market conditions, identifying appropriate franchise partners, and performance of company operations. The expected financial impact through 2010, including cash proceeds and improvement in restaurant margin and ROIC, will be provided at our investor update meeting on December 12.
 
 
 
Quarterly EPS results for 2008
will have the potential for sizeable swings from quarter to quarter. This would be due to factors such as our quarterly tax rate and timing of refranchising transactions, including any associated gains or losses. Other items that could have an impact on 2008 quarterly results include (1) one-time gain from the sale of our minority interest in KFC Japan (at least $70 million before taxes in Q1 2008), (2) expenses related to U.S. business-growth initiatives (amount and timing to be determined), (3) charges related to G&A productivity initiatives, refranchising, and realignment of resources to drive stronger U.S. brand growth (up to $20 million before taxes in Q1 2008 with impact to remaining quarters to be determined). Additional information will be provided at our investor update meeting on December 12.
 
Note: All preceding guidance is in "as reported" terms unless otherwise noted as local-currency basis.

key items
