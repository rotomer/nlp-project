Note
FULL-YEAR 2008 OUTLOOK
The company raised its full-year 2008 EPS forecast from $1.82 to $1.85 per share, or at least 10% growth. This is prior to significant one-time gain items described later in this release.
David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, I am pleased to report that we ended our first decade as a public company in 2007 by once again demonstrating the underlying power of our global portfolio of leading restaurant brands. Fueled by strong 2007 same-store-sales growth of 3% and continued profitable international expansion, including record new-restaurant openings of 471 in mainland China and 852 in YRI, we achieved 15% EPS growth. This marks the sixth straight year of delivering on our commitment of at least 10% annual EPS growth.
Importantly for shareholders, our China and YRI divisions continued to generate outstanding operating results, with full-year same-store-sales growth of +10% and +6%, and operating profit growth of +30% and +18%, respectively. With such powerful results, we generated record cash from operating activities of nearly $1.6 billion and returned an all-time high of $1.7 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we announced in October our plan to substantially increase the amount of share buybacks over the next two years, repurchasing a total of up to $4 billion of the companys outstanding common stock.
As we enter our second decade, we expect 2008 to be another excellent year. We are confident we can continue to build on our track record of growing EPS at least 10% each year by generating 20% operating profit growth from our China Division, 10% from our YRI Division and 5% from our U.S. businesses. Our teams, strategies and financial strength have never been better, and we are totally focused on delivering exceptional results for our shareholders.
Shareholders should expect us to continue building consistent value by differentiating our global portfolio of brands and driving profitable global expansion through our four key strategies: building leading brands in China in every significant category; driving aggressive international expansion and building strong brands everywhere; dramatically improving U.S. brand positions, consistency and returns; and driving industry-leading, long-term shareholder and franchisee value.
CHINA DIVISION
CHINA DIVISION COMMENTS
For 2007, we opened a record 471 new units in mainland China, further strengthening our leadership position in Chinas rapidly growing restaurant category. In 2006, we opened 364 new restaurants in mainland China.
Mainland Chinas fourth-quarter same-store-sales growth of 17% was the best ever for the market, while simultaneously achieving record-level unit growth in 2007.
For the fourth-quarter and full-year 2007, the slight decrease in restaurant margin percentage was better than anticipated, as record same-store-sales growth largely offset unusually high food-cost inflation. We expect high food-cost inflation to continue into the first half of 2008 and moderate later in the year.
Foreign currency conversion continued to provide benefit in both fourth-quarter and full-year operating profit, $6 million and $19 million, respectively.
YUM! RESTAURANTS INTERNATIONAL DIVISION (YRI)
YRI DIVISION COMMENTS
For the fourth quarter, YRIs operating profit growth was negatively impacted by 5 percentage points due to incremental investments in KFC sales-growth initiatives, incremental incentive compensation, and selected, market-level organizational restructuring.
For 2007, we opened a record 852 new restaurants in our YRI Division, 94% of which were opened by our franchise and joint-venture partners. This is the ninth consecutive year of at least 3% year-over-year YRI net unit growth. YRI continues to build an enviable development track record.
YRI same-store-sales growth was strong at +5% and +6% for fourth-quarter and full-year 2007, respectively.
Franchise fees, a key driver of our high-return business, passed the $500 million mark during 2007 with full-year growth of 15%.
The strength of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar continued to provide benefit in both fourth-quarter and full-year operating profit, $10 million and $24 million, respectively.
UNITED STATES BUSINESS
U.S. BUSINESS COMMENTS
Fourth-quarter same-store-sales growth was +1%, driven by broad-based growth in our franchise business.
Taco Bell company same-store sales performance improved to flat in Q4 after declines in the first three quarters of 2007.
Restaurant margin percentage declined due to unusually high food-cost inflation, with full-year commodity-cost inflation of $44 million, partially mitigated by pricing. Nearly half of the commodity inflation occurred in the fourth quarter.
As anticipated, fourth-quarter and full-year 2007 operating margin percentage improved due to higher franchise fees and reduced G&A expense from increased franchise ownership.
CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED G&A EXPENSES
For the fourth quarter, the $31 million year-over-year increase in corporate and unallocated G&A expenses was mainly due to higher annual incentive compensation, investments in strategic projects, and litigation-related expenses.
TAX RATE
Tax rates for fourth-quarter and full-year 2007 were lower than prior year due to recognition of foreign-tax credit benefits.
U.S. REFRANCHISING UPDATE
During 2007, a total of 304 company-owned U.S. restaurants were sold to franchisees. Since the beginning of 2006, our U.S. refranchising program has reduced the percentage of company ownership from 26% to 22% at the end of 2007. As we previously announced in our 2008 guidance, we are expanding our refranchising of U.S. company-owned restaurants, with company ownership to potentially reach below 10% by year-end 2010.
SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS
During the fourth quarter of 2007, we purchased 16 million shares at an average purchase price of $37.03, or a total of $603 million. For the year, we purchased 42 million shares at an average purchase price of $33.66, or a total of $1.4 billion, reducing average diluted shares outstanding by 4%, the third consecutive year with share reduction as a result of substantial share buybacks. Over the past two years, the companys share repurchases reduced average diluted share count by 9%, at an average cost per share of $29.31.
For 2008, we expect to return over $2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and significant share buybacks.
FULL-YEAR 2008 UPDATE
EPS of $1.85 or at least 10% growth. This is prior to the significant one-time gain items outlined below.
For full-year 2008, we expect a one-time gain from the sale of our minority interest in KFC Japan during the first quarter, as well as gains from global refranchising. We expect these gains will be partially offset by charges relating to G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources, as well as investments in our U.S. brands to drive stronger growth. The net impact of the gains and charges is expected to generate approximately $50 million in pre-tax profit, or about $0.06 full-year EPS, which is not included in our full-year 2008 guidance of $1.85.
As we previously communicated during our annual investor conference on December 12, 2007, we expect the expansion of U.S. refranchising will generate the following financial impacts over a three-year period: pretax sales proceeds (net of investment) of about $1.1 billion, U.S. margin improvement of about 2.5%, neutral to slightly dilutive to U.S. operating profit, YUM ROIC improvement of about 3 percentage points, net refranchising gains of about $350 million, and EPS accretion of about 2%.

Q1 2008 EPS UPDATE
In the first quarter of 2008, we expect the following one-time impacts: pre-tax gain of approximately $87 million from the sale of our minority interest in KFC Japan; charges of up to $10 million before taxes related to G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources to drive stronger U.S. brand growth; and expected refranchising losses of about $20 million.
YUM! ONGOING EARNINGS GROWTH MODEL (UPDATED)
China Division operating-profit growth of 20%. This growth is driven largely by new-unit development in mainland China. Our key metric for mainland China is system-sales growth with an annual target of +20% driven by at least 425 new-restaurant openings.
YRI Division operating-profit growth of 10%. This growth is driven mainly by new-unit development, measured by system-sales growth of at least 5% (3% to 4% unit growth and 2% to 3% same-store-sales growth) including 750 new-restaurant openings.
U.S. operating-profit growth of 5% with same-store-sales growth of 2% to 3% and leverage of the G&A infrastructure.
EPS growth of at least 10%. This assumes operating profit performance from our three lines of business as previously noted with additional benefit from reduction in shares outstanding due to substantial share buybacks.
