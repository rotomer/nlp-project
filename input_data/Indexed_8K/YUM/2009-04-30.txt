LOUISVILLE, KY, April 30, 2009  Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today announced that it has commenced a cash tender offer to purchase up to $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7.700% Senior Notes due July 1, 2012 (the Notes). The tender offer is being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated as of April 30, 2009, and the related Letter of Transmittal.
 
 
The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on May 28, 2009, unless extended. Subject to the terms and conditions of the tender offer, Yum! Brands expects to pay for Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on the business day after the date on which the tender offer expires.
 
Holders must tender their Notes by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 13, 2009, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the total consideration (which includes the early tender payment set forth above). Holders who tender their Notes after such time but prior to the expiration of the tender offer will be eligible to receive the total consideration less the early tender payment. The total consideration will be determined as described in the Offer to Purchase based on the present value of future payments on the Notes discounted to the settlement date at a rate equal to the sum of the yield to maturity for the reference security, calculated by the dealer managers based on the bid-side price at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 26, 2009, plus the fixed spread referred to above, minus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date to, but not including, the settlement date.
 
In addition, payments for Notes purchased pursuant to the tender offer will include accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date to, but not including, the settlement date.
