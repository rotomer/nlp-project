On August 24, 2010, subsidiaries of Yum! Brands, Inc. ("Yum!") entered into a Participant Distribution Joinder Agreement whereby they became bound by the terms and conditions of that certain Master Distribution Agreement (the "Master Distribution Agreement"), by and between Unified Foodservice Purchasing Co-op, LLC, which is the exclusive domestic purchasing agent of Yum! and the Yum! system of restaurants, and McLane Foodservice, Inc. ("McLane"). Under the Master Distribution Agreement McLane will distribute products to A&W, KFC, Long John Silver's, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell retail outlets operated by Yum! subsidiaries and other Yum! franchisees (the "Operators"). The Master Distribution Agreement is effective as of January 1, 2011 and continues until December 31, 2016 unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, and, thereafter, automatically renews for additional one-year periods.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Distribution Agreement, Operators (including subsidiaries of Yum!) that enter into Participant Distribution Joinder Agreements will be obligated to purchase from McLane, and McLane will be obligated to purchase from suppliers and resell and distribute to each participating Operator, substantially all of the proprietary and non-proprietary food, supplies, packaging, beverages, promotional and other items used or sold in each participating Operator's retail outlets within the defined distribution area, which includes much of the U.S.
 
The Master Distribution Agreement and the Participant Distribution Joinder Agreement entered into by subsidiaries of Yum! will be filed as exhibits to Yum! Brands, Inc.'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 4, 2010.
