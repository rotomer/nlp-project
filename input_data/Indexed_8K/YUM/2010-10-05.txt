FULL YEAR OUTLOOK
 
 
 
 
David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO said, Im pleased to report we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to 14%, which will make 2010 the 9 consecutive year we meet or exceed our annual target of at least 10%.  We take satisfaction that our year-to-date operating profit has increased 15%, excluding special items and the impact of foreign currency translation, and is driving our strong EPS growth this year.  A key driver of our overall growth continues to be new unit development in China and Yum! Restaurants International.  We expect to open about 1,400 international new units this year.  This new unit growth positions us well for another su ccessful year in 2011.
th
 
We continue to make progress at all three divisions and are especially pleased with the continued strong results from our China business.  The combination of high return new unit development, same-store-sales growth, and increasing margins drove operating profit growth of 23% in China for the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.   At Yum! Restaurants International, we increased system sales by 5% and grew operating profit 16%, prior to foreign currency translation benefit.  Our U.S. business modestly improved same-store-sales growth and margin but operating profit declined slightly.  We expect sales momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.
Overall, we are encouraged with our strong performance.    We continue to drive aggressive, international expansion while maintaining our industry-leading return on invested capital.  Our intent is to continue to build shareholder value and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results
 
In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2010 and 2009 on a basis before Special Items.  Included in Special Items are the U.S. refranchising gain (loss), the depreciation benefit from the KFC restaurants impaired in the first quarter of 2010, charges relating to U.S. General and Administrative (G&A) productivity initiatives and realignment of resources, investments in our U.S. Brands, the loss recognized upon refranchising of an equity market outside the U.S. and the 2009 gain upon our acquisition of additional ownership in, and consolidation of, the operating entity that owns the KFCs in Shanghai, China.  These amounts are described in (d), (e) and (f) in the accompanying notes.
 
The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally.  This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2010 and 2009 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.
