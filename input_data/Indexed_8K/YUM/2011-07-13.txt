David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO said, I'm pleased to report we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12% based on the continued strength of our international businesses. We delivered EPS growth of 13% in the second quarter as strong performance in China and other emerging markets, combined with the benefit of a lower tax rate, offset a very disappointing quarter in the U.S.
Our China business continues to be the leading growth story in the restaurant industry, as our category-leading brands are performing stronger than ever. Operating profit grew 25% in China, prior to foreign currency translation, as same-store sales grew an impressive 18%. We surpassed 4,000 restaurants in China this quarter and our new unit returns remain excellent. Yum! Restaurants International (YRI) operating profit increased 11%, led by outstanding performance in high-growth emerging markets, where system sales grew 11%, both prior to foreign currency translation. Our development pipeline is robust, and we remain on track to open 1,400 new units outside the U.S. this year. We are confident new unit development will continue to be a key factor in our ability to drive future sales and profit growth.
Our outstanding international results were offset by a 28% decline in U.S. profits, driven by higher commodity costs and a 4% decline in same-store sales. As previously communicated, we anticipated weak second quarter sales and profits, driven largely by the negative impact of a meritless lawsuit and resulting negative publicity at Taco Bell. We expect to improve on these very disappointing results by the fourth quarter.
For the full year, we expect strong performance from both China and YRI as well as the benefit from foreign currency translation to overcome a challenging year in the U.S. We're obviously confident 2011 will be the tenth consecutive year we exceed our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
 
In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2011 and 2010 on a basis before Special Items.  Included in Special Items are the U.S. refranchising gain (loss), the depreciation reduction from the KFC restaurants impaired upon our offer to refranchise in 2010 that remained Company stores for some or all of the quarter and year to date ended June 11, 2011, charges relating to U.S. General and Administrative ("G&A") productivity initiatives and realignment of resources, the 2010 loss recognized as a result of refranchising an equity market outside the U.S., and the impairment of intangibles and other costs relating to the planned sale of our Long John Silver's ("LJS") and A&W All-American Food Restaurants ("A&W") brands.  These amounts are described in (b), (c) and (d) in the accompanying notes.
 
The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally.  This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2011 and 2010 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.
