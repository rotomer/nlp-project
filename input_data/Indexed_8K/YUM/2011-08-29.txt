INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.
 
(a)
          
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities as incurred, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused
by any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act Regulations or arise out of, are based upon or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company will not be liable to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by (i) any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon the Form T-1, or (ii) any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
provided
however
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter severally (and not jointly) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters, but only with respect to such losses, claims, damages, and liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) that arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or omission or allegedly untrue statement or omission included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(c)
          
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7, such person (the "") will promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, will retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and will pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party will have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party (whether or not the indemnifying party was an original named party to such proceeding) and the indemnified party and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be actual or potential conflicts of interest between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party including situations in which there may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from, or additional to, those available to the indemnifying party.  It is understood that the indemnifying party will not, in connection with any proceeding or substantially similar or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm will be designated in writing by the Manager (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph) or by the Company (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph), as the case may be.  The indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any claim, action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party will, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution could have been sought
indemnified party
indemnifying party
hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by, the indemnified party.  Any provision of this paragraph (c) to the contrary notwithstanding, no failure by an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party as required hereunder will relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have had to an indemnified party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or (b).
 
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party thereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of Debt Securities by the Underwriters, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the offering of Debt Securities by the Underwriters will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds received by the Company from the offering of such Debt Securities bears to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company in respect thereof.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied or to be supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(e)
          
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (d) above were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to therein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Any other provisions of this Section 7 to the contrary notwithstanding (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Debt Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The obligations of the Underwriters of Debt Securities in paragraph (d) above and this paragraph (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such securities and not joint.
 
(f)
           
The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and will not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
8.
            
TERMINATION.  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the Company if, at any time prior to the Closing Date, (i) there shall have occurred (A) any material adverse change (or development involving a prospective material adverse change) in the business, properties, earnings, or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (B) any suspension or material limitation of trading in the Company's capital stock by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the ""), or (C) any decrease by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation with respect to the ratings of any of the debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any public announcement by any such organization to the effect that it has placed any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company on what is
NYSE
commonly termed a "watch list" with negative implications (the events described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (C) the ""), the effect of any of which Company-Specific Events shall have made it impracticable, in the reasonable judgment of the Manager, to market such Debt Securities, or (ii) there shall have occurred (A) any suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the NYSE or the establishment of minimum prices on the NYSE, (B) a declaration of a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States adversely affecting transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement or (C) any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis (the events described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (C) the ""), the effect of any of which Market Events (other than the Market Event described in Clause (B), which shall not be subject to the following qualification) shall have made it impracticable, in the reasonable judgment of the Manager, to market such Debt Securities.

If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Debt Securities and the aggregate amount of Debt Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Debt Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Manager and the Company for the purchase of such Debt Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In any such case either the Manager or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date but in no event for longer then seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Pricing Disclosure Package and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

SURVIVABILITY.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Debt Securities.
 
11.
          
CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS.  If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Debt Securities except as provided in Sections 4 and 7 hereof; but, if for any other reason (other than a default by the Underwriters under Section 9 hereof) Debt Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Manager for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Manager, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Debt Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Debt Securities except as provided in Sections 4 and 7 hereof.
 
12.
          
NO ADVISORY OR FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP.

fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.  The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered any such advisory services, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

CHANGE OF CONTROL.  If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes (as described above), the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's Notes on the terms set forth below.  In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").  Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice shall be mailed to holders of the Notes describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date").

deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an officer's certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.
 
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.  In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
 
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.

"Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement rating agency or rating agencies.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
 
"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Moody's and S&P, and (2) if either Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
 
"Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control and (2) public notice of the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control; provided, however, that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's or its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).

Exhibit A
 
Capitalized terms used in this Officers' Certificate and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
Each of the undersigned, for himself, states that he has read and is familiar with the provisions of Article II of the Indenture relating to the establishment of a series of Securities thereunder and the establishment of a form of Security representing a series of Securities thereunder and, in each case, the definitions therein relating thereto; that he is generally familiar with the other provisions of the Indenture and with the affairs of the Company and its acts and proceedings and that the statements and opinions made by him in this Certificate are based upon such familiarity; and that he has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to determine whether or not the covenants and conditions referred to above have been complied with; and in his opinion, such covenants and conditions have been complied with.
 
Insofar as this Certificate relates to legal matters it is based upon the Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Trustee contemporaneously herewith pursuant to Section 2.4 of the Indenture and relating to the Notes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have hereunto signed this Certificate on behalf of the Company as of this 29th day of August, 2011.
Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Notes in definitive form, this Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary.  Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York ("DTC") to the issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of DTC and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC, ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL since the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
YUM! Brands, Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of North Carolina (herein referred to as the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture as hereinafter referred to) for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of                                                                              on November 1, 2021 and to pay interest thereon from August 29, 2011 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, in each year, commencing on May 1, 2012 at the rate of 3.75% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined herein), be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date, which shall be April 15 or October 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and may either be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.  Payment of the principal and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and at any other office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities; and provided, further, that the Holder of this Note shall be entitled to receive payments of principal of and interest on this Note by wire transfer of immediately available funds, if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable payment date.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth herein, which further provisions shall for all proposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or its duly appointed authenticating agent by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, YUM! Brands, Inc. has caused this instrument to be signed by the manual signature of its Chairman of the Board, one of its Vice Chairmen, its President or one of its Vice Presidents, or the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries.
This is one of the Notes of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

However, at any time prior to the date that is three months prior to the Stated Maturity, the Notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date; and (ii) the sum of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of the payment of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date), discounted to their present value as of the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined herein), as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined herein), plus 25 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be redeemed to the Redemption Date.
 
At any time on or after the date that is three months prior to the Stated Maturity, the Notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined herein), assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined herein) for such Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes.  "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers (as defined herein) who the Company appointed.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined herein) for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Company is provided fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third business day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, and their respective successors, and, at the Company's option, additional Primary Treasury Dealers; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is prior to the Redemption Date of any Note will be payable to the Holder of such Note, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date referred to above, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed.  Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the Outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for redemption. If fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of such Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in authorized denominations in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of this Note shall relate, in the case that this Note is redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to that portion of the principal amount of this Note that has been or is to be redeemed.
 
Change of Control
 
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes (as described above), the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's Notes on the terms set forth below.  In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").  Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice shall be mailed to holders of the Notes describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date").  The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
(1)
          
accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
 
(2)
          
deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
 
(3)
          
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an officer's certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.
 
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.  In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
 
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of any such conflict.
 
For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the following definitions shall apply:
 
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (2) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to one or more "persons" (as that term is defined in the Indenture), other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.
 
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Event.
 
"Continuing Director" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Company's Board of Directors who (1) was a member of such Board of Directors on the date the Notes were issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director).
 
"Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement rating agency or rating agencies.
 
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
 
"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Moody's and S&P, and (2) if either Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
 
"Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control and (2) public notice of the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control; provided, however, that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's or its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).
 
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
 
"Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
 
Other Provisions of the Notes and the Indenture
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.  Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities.  The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article VIII of the Indenture, of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
The Indenture permits the Company, by irrevocably depositing, in amounts and maturities sufficient to pay
 
and discharge at the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be, the entire indebtedness on all Outstanding Notes, cash or direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are fully guaranteed by, the United States government, and which are not subject to prepayment, redemption or call, with the Trustee in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of all Outstanding Notes, to defease the Indenture with respect to such Notes, and upon such deposit the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged its entire indebtedness on such Notes. Thereafter, Holders would be able to look only to such trust fund for payment of principal and interest at the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be. The Indenture also permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the Company to be released from certain of its obligations under the Indenture on the terms and subject to the conditions therein provided.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6 or 9.5 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Registration Statement on Form S-3
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to YUM! Brands, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offer and sale of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Securities") as set forth in the Prospectus Supplement dated August 22, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement") as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
The Securities will be issued under an Indenture, dated as of May 1, 1998, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (successor in interest to the First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (the "Indenture").
 
As special counsel to the Company, we have examined originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws, resolutions of the Company's Board of Directors and such Company records, certificates and other documents and such questions of law as we considered necessary or appropriate for the purpose of this opinion.  In rendering this opinion, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and to the assumptions, conditions and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that upon the due execution, authentication, issuance and delivery of the Securities, and the receipt of the consideration therefor set forth in the Prospectus Supplement, the Securities will be valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K and to being named in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Legal Matters" with respect to the matters stated therein.
