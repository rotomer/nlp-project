David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO said, I'm pleased to report EPS growth of 13% in the third quarter, excluding special items. As a result of strong performance in China and other emerging markets, we confidently reaffirm our full-year EPS growth forecast of at least 12%, which will make 2011 the 10
th
consecutive year we exceed our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth.
In China, operating profit grew 7% for the quarter as system sales jumped 29%, prior to foreign currency translation. Likewise, year-to-date operating profit increased 15% with system sales up 27%. This tremendous sales growth, combined with our expectation to open a record 600 new restaurants this year, gives us even more confidence our China business model is as strong as ever. At Yum! Restaurants International (YRI), operating profit increased 3% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date, prior to foreign currency translation. We are extremely excited about our progress in emerging markets like India, Africa and Russia, as these businesses will contribute meaningful profit growth to Yum! in the coming years. Importantly, we expect to open about 900 new restaurants this year at YRI. The robust new unit growth in China and YRI not only contributes to this year's earnings, but positions Yum! for strong growth in 2012 as well.
Our impressive international growth was offset by a 16% decline in U.S. profits. We're obviously disappointed in our U.S. performance. However, we have aggressively developed a pipeline of category leading innovation and have productivity initiatives planned to dramatically improve sales and profit performance in 2012. Looking ahead, the strength of our international brands and outstanding new unit development, combined with aggressive U.S. initiatives, make us confident we will continue our track record of double-digit earnings growth next year and beyond.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
 
In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2011 and 2010 on a basis before Special Items.  Included in Special Items are the U.S. refranchising gain (loss), the depreciation reduction from the KFC restaurants impaired upon our offer to refranchise in 2010 that remained Company stores for some or all of the quarter or year to date ended September 3, 2011, charges relating to U.S. General and Administrative ("G&A") productivity initiatives and realignment of resources, the losses associated with refranchising equity markets outside the U.S., and the impairment of intangibles, other costs and anticipated tax benefits relating to the planned sale of our Long John Silver's ("LJS") and A&W All-American Food Restaurants ("A&W") brands.  These amounts are described in (b), (c), (d) and (e) in the accompanying notes.
 
The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally.  This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2011 and 2010 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.
