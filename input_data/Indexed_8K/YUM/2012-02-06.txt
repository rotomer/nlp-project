David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO said, I'm pleased to report full-year EPS growth of 14%, making 2011 the tenth consecutive year we exceeded our annual target of at least 10%.
The highlight of 2011 was again the exceptional performance of our China business, which grew system sales by 29% and operating profit by 15%, prior to foreign currency translation. We opened a record 656 new restaurants and delivered extraordinary same-store sales growth of 19%. Clearly, our KFC and Pizza Hut brands in China continued to strengthen their category-leading positions. At the same time, Yum! Restaurants International opened 905 new units, including 622 in high-growth emerging markets. We are on the ground floor of growth in India, Russia and Africa, where system sales grew at strong double-digit rates. For the year, our emerging market businesses at Yum! Restaurants International grew system sales 13%, prior to foreign currency translation, including new-unit growth of 7%. Emerging markets contributed nearly 50% of operating profit at Yum! Restaurants International. The Yum! growth story is clearly about China and a whole lot more.
We continue to focus on three key elements that drive the value of our company: new-unit development, same-store sales growth, and high returns. Our new-unit potential in emerging markets is arguably the best in the restaurant industry. To put this in perspective, today we have fewer than two restaurants per million people in the top 10 emerging markets compared to nearly 60 restaurants per million people in the U.S. Clearly, we have a very long runway for growth. To fully maximize the value of our existing asset base of 37,000 restaurants, we are introducing sales layers like breakfast, expanded beverages and new product platforms. Finally, we continue to be disciplined with capital as we invest in high-return growth opportunities around the world, along with paying a meaningful dividend and making significant share repurchases. Our return on invested capital of over 22% is among industry leaders and has improved for eight consecutive years.
We are proud of our consistent track record of growth and are well-positioned to meet or exceed our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth in 2012.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
 
In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2011 and 2010 on a basis before Special Items.  Included in Special Items are the U.S. refranchising gain (loss), the depreciation reduction from the KFC restaurants impaired upon our offer to refranchise in 2010 that remained Company stores for some or all of the quarter or year presented, charges relating to U.S. General and Administrative ("G&A") productivity initiatives and realignment of resources, the losses and other costs relating to the sales of Long John Silver's ("LJS") and A&W All-American Food Restaurants ("A&W") brands, the losses associated with refranchising equity markets outside the U.S. and the depreciation reduction from the Pizza Hut UK restaurants impaired upon our decision to refranchise these restaurants which remain company-owned as of December 31, 2011.   These amounts are described in (b), (c), (d) and (e) in the accompanying notes.
 
The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally.  This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2011 and 2010 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.
