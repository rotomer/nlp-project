On March 22, 2012, Yum! Brands, Inc. (Yum) executed a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) totaling $1.30 billion, which replaces a five-year facility in the amount of $1.15 billion that was set to expire on November 29, 2012 (the Refinanced Domestic Credit Facility) and a five-year facility in the amount of $350 million that was set to expire on November 29, 2012 (the Refinanced International Facility and together with the Refinanced Domestic Credit Facility, the Refinanced Credit Facilities). J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities LLC arranged the Credit Facility and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will serve as Administrative Agent for the Credit Facility, which was syndicated among 24 participants.
Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Yum may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit or banker's acceptances, where applicable. The interest rate for most borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The exact spread over LIBOR under the Credit Facility will depend upon Yum's performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly.
The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by Yum's principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement. These covenants are substantially similar to those contained in the Refinanced Credit Facilities which were filed as Exhibits 10.6 and 10.30, respectively, to Yum's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007. The Credit Facility will be filed as an exhibit to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 24, 2012.
The information described above under Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operations - Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
