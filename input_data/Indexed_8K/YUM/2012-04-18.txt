David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, I am pleased to report each of our divisions produced impressive sales and profit results, driving 21% first-quarter EPS growth. Given the strength of our first-quarter results, we are raising our full-year EPS growth forecast to at least 12%, excluding Special Items.
Our China business continues to fire on all cylinders, and our category-leading brands are as strong as ever. China system sales grew 28% as we opened 168 new restaurants and delivered same-store sales growth of 14%; operating profit grew 14%, prior to foreign currency translation. Yum! Restaurants International continues to generate consistent growth as system sales grew 8% and we opened 123 new units in 41 countries. Same-store sales growth of 5% was led by an 8% increase in emerging markets at YRI, driving 9% operating profit growth, prior to foreign currency translation. Yum! Restaurants India, our newest division, grew system sales 34% and we expect to open 100 new restaurants this year. Overall for the first quarter, we opened 250 new restaurants in high-growth emerging markets. We believe our new unit potential in emerging markets is the best in the restaurant industry and we're still on the ground floor of growth.
While we realize there is much work to do, we are optimistic we will dramatically improve our U.S. brand positions, consistency and returns. We are pleased with our first-quarter performance in the United States, with same-store sales growth of 5%, led by Taco Bell, and operating profit growth of 27%.
In summary, we're off to a strong start to the year in each of our businesses. These results give us even more confidence that we will continue our track record of double-digit annual EPS growth.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
 
In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2012 and 2011 on a basis before Special Items.  Included in Special Items are the U.S. refranchising gain (loss), the gain on the acquisition of Little Sheep, the loss associated with the planned refranchising of the Pizza Hut UK business and the losses and other costs relating to our decision to divest the Long John Silver's ("LJS") and A&W All-American Food Restaurants ("A&W") brands. These amounts are described in (d), (e), (f) and (g) in the accompanying notes. Other Special Items include the depreciation reductions from KFC U.S. and Pizza Hut UK restaurants impaired upon our decision and/or offer to refranchise that remained Company stores for some or all of the periods presented and charges relating to U.S. General and Administrative ("G&A") productivity initiatives and realignment of resources.  
The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and Special Items are not included in any of our segment results.  This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2012 and 2011 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.

Other than the $74 million gain discussed above, for the quarter ended March 24, 2012, the consolidation of Little Sheep did not impact Operating Profit or Net Income - YUM! Brands, Inc. While we have not yet completed our allocation of the purchase price, our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 24, 2012 reflects the consolidation of this entity using preliminary amounts, including $283 million of goodwill and $521 million of other intangible assets. Also, we released from escrow $300 million of cash that was deemed restricted prior to our acquisition of Little Sheep.
