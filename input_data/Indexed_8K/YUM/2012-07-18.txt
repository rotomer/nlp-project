David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, I'm pleased to report we generated strong system sales growth in each of our divisions in the second quarter, with robust new-unit development and exceptional same-store sales growth. Operating profit increased 8% while EPS growth of 1% was negatively impacted, as expected, by a higher tax rate versus last year. Our U.S. business increased operating profit 26% in the second quarter and drove our overall operating profit growth. We expect China and Yum! Restaurants International (YRI) to drive our second-half profit growth. Based on our first-half results and current solid sales trends, we reconfirm our full-year guidance of at least 12% EPS growth, excluding special items.
Yum! China, our largest profit-contributing division, reported strong system sales growth of 27%, prior to foreign currency translation. However, operating profit declined 4%, prior to foreign currency translation, as high inflation drove restaurant margins down 4 percentage points versus last year. We expect this to be short-lived, returning to double-digit profit growth in the second half of the year. Our outstanding China team now expects to open a record of at least 700 new units this year.
System sales grew 7% at YRI and operating profit grew 6%, both prior to foreign currency translation. Same-store sales in YRI's emerging markets grew 9%, driving overall same-store sales growth of 4% at YRI. System sales grew 32% in our India division. Our YRI and India divisions combined will also set a new-unit development record this year with over 1,000 new restaurants. Over 65% of these new units are expected to open in high-growth emerging markets.
Most importantly, I'm confident we're making our brands even more vibrant around the world. Our long-term growth prospects have never been brighter as we continue to deliver consistently strong annual results. We expect this year to be our eleventh consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth, prior to special items.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
 
In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2012 and 2011 on a basis before Special Items.  Included in Special Items are the U.S. refranchising gain (loss), the gain on the acquisition of Little Sheep, impairment charges and deal costs associated with the planned refranchising of the Pizza Hut UK business and the losses and other costs relating to our decision to divest the Long John Silver's ("LJS") and A&W All-American Food Restaurants ("A&W") brands. These amounts are described in (d), (e), (f) and (g) in the accompanying notes. Other Special Items include the depreciation reductions from KFC U.S. and Pizza Hut UK restaurants impaired upon our decision and/or offer to refranchise that remained Company stores for some or all of the periods presented, gains from sales of real estate related to our previously refranchised Mexico business and charges relating to U.S. General and Administrative ("G&A") productivity initiatives and realignment of resources.  
The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and Special Items are not included in any of our segment results.  This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2012 and 2011 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Summary of Results, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets
and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
Consolidated Little Sheep results are included in the China Division from the beginning of the second quarter of 2012. Little Sheep impacted China Division revenues by 4% and 2% for the quarter and year to date ended June 16, 2012, respectively. Other than the $74 million gain discussed above, Little Sheep did not have a significant impact on China Division's Operating Profit or Net Income - YUM! Brands, Inc. for the quarter and year to date ended June 16, 2012. China Division and Worldwide system sales include sales from Little Sheep's company-owned restaurants but exclude sales from Little Sheep's franchise restaurants. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 16, 2012 reflects the consolidation of this entity, including approximately $300 million of goodwill, $500 million of other intangible assets and a $45 million redeemable noncontrolling interest. Also, in the quarter ended March 24, 2012, we released from escrow $300 million of cash that was deemed restricted prior to our acquisition of Little Sheep.
