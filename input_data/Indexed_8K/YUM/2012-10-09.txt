David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, Very strong sales and profit at all of our divisions, including China, Yum! Restaurants International, India and the U.S., drove 19% third-quarter EPS growth. Given the strength of our year-to-date results, I'm pleased to report we are raising our full-year EPS growth forecast to at least 13%, excluding Special Items.
In China, our category-leading brands and competitive positions are stronger than ever. China system sales grew 22% as we opened 192 new restaurants and delivered same-store sales growth of 6%; operating profit grew 22%, prior to foreign currency translation. Importantly, China restaurant margin performance improved dramatically from the second quarter, once again demonstrating the ongoing strength of our business model. This strong performance, combined with our new expectation to open over 750 high-return new restaurants this year, further demonstrates why we are so confident in the long-term growth of our China business. Yum! Restaurants International (YRI) reported its best quarterly operating profit performance of the year with growth of 14%, prior to foreign currency translation. YRI, combined with Yum! Restaurants India, will have a record year of new unit development. When you add it all up for Yum!, we will open at least 1,750 new restaurants outside the U.S., further strengthening our leadership position in emerging markets. At the same time, our heightened operations focus and product innovation has driven much better performance in the U.S., with all three brands growing sales, margin and profit.
We expect 2012 to be our eleventh consecutive year of delivering at least 13% EPS growth, prior to Special Items. Our consistent track record is evidence that Yum! Brands is capable of delivering strong double-digit growth even in the most challenging economic times. We expect this to continue as we build on our track record of at least 10% EPS growth in 2013 and well into the future.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results
(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
(unaudited)
 
In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2012 and 2011 on a basis before Special Items.  Included in Special Items are the U.S. refranchising gain (loss), the gain on the acquisition of Little Sheep, impairment charges and deal costs associated with the planned refranchising of the Pizza Hut UK business and the losses, other costs and tax benefits in 2011 relating to our divestiture of the Long John Silver's ("LJS") and A&W All-American Food Restaurants ("A&W") brands. These amounts are described in (d), (e), (f) and (g) in the accompanying notes. Other Special Items include the depreciation reductions from Pizza Hut UK and KFC U.S. restaurants impaired upon our decision or offer to refranchise that remained Company stores for some or all of the periods presented, gains from sales of real estate related to our previously refranchised Mexico business and charges relating to U.S. General and Administrative ("G&A") productivity initiatives and realignment of resources.  
The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and Special Items are not included in any of our segment results.  This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.  Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2012 and 2011 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.

Consolidated Little Sheep results are included in the China Division from the beginning of the second quarter of 2012. Little Sheep impacted China Division revenues by 3% for both the quarter and year to date ended September 8, 2012. Other than the $74 million gain discussed above, Little Sheep did not have a significant impact on China Division's Operating Profit or Net Income - YUM! Brands, Inc. for the quarter and year to date ended September 8, 2012. China Division and Worldwide system sales include sales from Little Sheep's company-owned restaurants but exclude sales from Little Sheep's franchise restaurants. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 8, 2012 reflects the consolidation of this entity, including approximately $300 million of goodwill, $500 million of other intangible assets and a $45 million redeemable noncontrolling interest. Also, in the quarter ended March 24, 2012, we released from escrow $300 million of cash that was deemed restricted prior to our acquisition of Little Sheep.
