Yum! Brands Announces Full-Year 2013 Expectations;
Reconfirms Full-Year 2012 EPS Growth Forecast of at least 13%;
Will Host Investor Update Meeting Thursday, December 6, 2012
Louisville, KY (November 29, 2012) - Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM), in advance of its Annual Investor Meeting, reconfirms its full-year 2012 EPS growth forecast of at least 13%, or $3.24 per share, excluding Special Items. Yum! also announces it expects to once again deliver at least 10% EPS growth in 2013, excluding Special Items, which would mark twelve consecutive years of meeting or exceeding this annual EPS growth target.
David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, I'm pleased to report we remain on track to deliver at least 13% EPS growth this year. Our 2012 EPS growth is driven by double-digit operating profit growth, prior to foreign currency translation, in all three of our major operating divisions: China, Yum! Restaurants International and the U.S. Solid same-store sales growth at each of our divisions and record international new-unit development highlight the quality of our growth.
For the fourth quarter, stronger than expected operating performance from Yum! Restaurants International and our U.S. division is offsetting softer sales in China, where we now expect same-store sales to be negative as we overlap 21% same-store sales growth from last year. Full-year same-store sales growth in China is expected to be 6%. Next year will be another strong year for our China division, given this year's record development of at least 800 new units and significant innovation in the pipeline, underpinned by world class operations. We are extremely confident Yum! China remains the best growth story in the restaurant industry.
Our leading, global brands are well positioned in the fastest growing emerging markets. We remain focused on the three keys to driving shareholder value: new-unit development, same-store sales growth and high returns on invested capital.
