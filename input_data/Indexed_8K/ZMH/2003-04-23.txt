Elliott said that the change in accounting principle put into effect in the quarter, which moves Zimmer from an expense to an asset based model for loaner instruments, reflects industry practice and would allow investors to more accurately compare results among publicly traded orthopaedic companies. Elliott also noted that the company has continued to rapidly reduce its debt-to-capital ratio, now at 12%, based on the strength of $72 million of free cash flow.

Change in Accounting for Instruments
Effective January 1, 2003, Zimmer changed its accounting principle for company-owned surgical instruments used by orthopaedic surgeons to implant its products. Prior to January 1, 2003, instrument costs were accounted for using an expense based method and recognized as a selling, general and administrative expense in the year the instruments were placed into service. Effective January 1, 2003, the company began capitalizing instrument costs using an asset based method and depreciating the costs to selling, general and administrative expense over the instruments' estimated useful lives.
 
The company views the asset based method as preferable and it better aligns Zimmer's accounting policies with those of its competitors. A preferability letter from Zimmer's independent accountants will be included in the company's Form 10-Q.
The change in accounting principle resulted in a one time, non-cash, cumulative effect adjustment which increased first quarter 2003 net earnings by $55.1 million (net of tax), or $0.27 per diluted share. The cumulative effect adjustment was the result of capitalizing instruments in service at January 1, 2003 which, under our former method, had been expensed. In addition, first quarter 2003 earnings before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were favorably affected by $2.8 million (net of tax), or $0.014 per diluted share, reflecting the difference in the expense under the company's new method. "We believe this new policy better matches expenses with associated revenues over the periods benefited by these assets, and allows for a more meaningful comparison of our results to our major public competitors," said Sam Leno, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Guidance
The company is raising its previous guidance for both revenue and earnings per share as a result of its first quarter financial performance. Revenues for the full year 2003 are expected to grow 16% to 17% over prior year, implying $1,592 to $1,605 million. Earnings per share are expected to increase 23% to 24% over prior year, implying $1.61 to $1.62 for the full year utilizing the historic expense model for instrument accounting, with approximately $0.39 to $0.40 expected in the second quarter. The effect of the change to an asset model for instrument accounting should result in an additional $0.04 to $0.05 in earnings per share for the full year, implying $1.65 to $1.67.
