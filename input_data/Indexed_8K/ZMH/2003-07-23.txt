Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 23, 2003, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. reported its results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Zimmer's earnings release for the quarter is attached as Exhibit 99(a) and the information set forth therein is incorporated herein by reference and constitutes a part of this report. The attached Exhibit is furnished pursuant to Item 9 and Item 12 of Form 8-K.
     The earnings release attached as Exhibit 99(a) discloses the non-GAAP financial measures of Free Cash Flow and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). Free Cash Flow and EBITDA have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities and Operating Profit, within the earnings release. Management considers Free Cash Flow an important measure of cash flow available for debt repayment, acquisition funding and other investing and financing activities. Management considers EBITDA to be an important measure of profitability used by its investors, debt holders, debt rating agencies and stock analysts when analyzing Zimmer's financial performance and comparing it to those of Zimmer's competitors. However, these measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Zimmer also announced that Standard and Poor's indicated it "will likely raise Zimmer's corporate credit rating to BBB' if the company is able to complete the (Centerpulse) transaction under currently proposed conditions." Moody's Investor Services assigned a prospective Baa3 rating to Zimmer's planned senior bank facility, with a stable outlook.
Credit Ratings for Acquisition Financing
The company is providing sales and diluted earnings per share guidance for the balance of 2003. For the full year, reported sales are expected to grow approximately 18%, implying approximately $1,620 million. Third quarter reported sales are expected to increase approximately 16% over prior year to approximately $390 million, while fourth quarter reported sales are expected to increase approximately 15% to approximately $425 million. The growth rates expected for both the third and the fourth quarters reflect the diminishing effects of foreign currency differences from those experienced throughout the first half of 2003. For the full year, diluted earnings per share are estimated to grow approximately 29%, to approximately $1.69. This implies diluted EPS of approximately $0.40 and $0.44 in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. All diluted EPS estimates exclude the expensing of any costs incurred related to the potential acquisition of Centerpulse and also exclude the cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the first quarter related to the change in accounting for instruments.
