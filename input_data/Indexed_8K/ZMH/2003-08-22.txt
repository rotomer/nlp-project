Item 5. Other Events. On July 2, 2003, the Swiss Takeover Board issued recommendations with respect to the exchange offers by Zimmer Holdings, Inc. for all of the outstanding registered shares (including shares represented by American depositary shares) of Centerpulse AG and all of the outstanding bearer shares of InCentive Capital AG ("InCentive" and, such offer, the "InCentive Offer"). On August 15, 2003, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission affirmed and, in part, clarified the Swiss Takeover Board's recommendations. In response to the Swiss Federal Banking Commission's order relating to the InCentive Offer, Zimmer has modified "addend B" of the price calculation formula to provide that the calculation of "addend B" (the adjusted net asset value of InCentive) will be confirmed by "InCentive's auditors" (rather than "an accounting firm of international repute to be appointed by Zimmer"). The above announcement was made on August 22, 2003, and is attached hereto as exhibit 99.1. Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
