Item 5. Other Events. In accordance with Swiss law, Zimmer announced on September 2, 2003 the definitive interim results of Zimmer's offer for all of the outstanding registered shares (including shares represented by American depositary shares ("ADSs")) of Centerpulse AG ("Centerpulse" and, such offer, the "Offer") and Zimmer's offer for all of the outstanding bearer shares of InCentive Capital AG, a significant shareholder of Centerpulse ("InCentive") (such offer, the "InCentive Offer" and, together with the Offer, the "Offers"). The initial offering period for the Offers expired at 4:00 p.m., Central European time, 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, August 27, 2003. Based on information provided by Credit Suisse First Boston and Mellon Investor Services LLC (the Swiss offer manager and the U.S. exchange agent, respectively, for the Offer), as of the expiration of the initial offering period, 7,489,650 Centerpulse registered shares and 6,712,776 ADSs, including ADSs subject to the guaranteed delivery procedures, were tendered and not withdrawn. Based on information provided by Centerpulse, these shares and ADSs represent approximately 68.0% of the outstanding Centerpulse registered shares (including shares represented by ADSs) and, together with the Centerpulse registered shares held by InCentive, approximately 86.7% of the issued Centerpulse registered shares (including shares represented by ADSs). In accordance with the terms of the Offer, holders of Centerpulse registered shares will receive 3.68 shares of common stock, par value US$0.01 per share, of Zimmer ("Zimmer Common Stock") and CHF 120 in cash for each Centerpulse registered share tendered and not withdrawn and holders of ADSs will receive 0.368 of a share of Zimmer Common Stock and CHF 12 in cash for each ADS tendered and not withdrawn. Based on information provided by Credit Suisse First Boston (the Swiss offer manager for the InCentive Offer), as of the expiration of the initial offering period, 2,123,647 InCentive bearer shares were tendered and not withdrawn, representing approximately 98.9% of the outstanding InCentive bearer shares. In accordance with the terms of InCentive Offer, holders of InCentive bearer shares will receive 3.8349 shares of Zimmer Common Stock and CHF 178.84 in cash for each InCentive bearer share tendered and not withdrawn, based on the adjusted net asset value of InCentive of CHF 115,490,610. Zimmer has accepted for payment all Centerpulse registered shares and ADSs and InCentive bearer shares tendered and not withdrawn during the initial offering period. In accordance with the terms of the Offers, Zimmer is providing a subsequent offering period, or additional acceptance period, for each of the Offers of ten Swiss trading days in order to provide holders of Centerpulse registered shares or ADSs or InCentive bearer shares who have not tendered their registered shares or ADSs or bearer shares during the initial offering period with the opportunity to tender their registered shares or ADSs or bearer shares into the Offers. The subsequent offering period for each of the Offers begins on Tuesday, September 2, 2003 and expires at 4:00 p.m., Central European time, 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on Monday, September 15, 2003. Centerpulse registered shares and ADSs and InCentive bearer shares tendered during the subsequent offering period may not be withdrawn. The settlement date for the exchange of Centerpulse registered shares and ADSs and InCentive bearer shares for shares of Zimmer Common Stock is expected to take place on October 2, 2003, subject to approval by competent Swiss authorities. On the same day, the offered cash amount per tendered Centerpulse registered share or ADS or InCentive bearer share (including any cash to be paid instead of issuing fractional shares of Zimmer Common Stock) will be paid. On August 28, 2003, Smith & Nephew plc announced that it did not receive the minimum level of valid tenders in connection with its exchange offers for all of the outstanding Centerpulse registered shares and ADSs and InCentive bearer shares as of the expiration of the offers on August 27, 2003, and declared that its offers had failed. Smith & Nephew plc announced that it will release the Centerpulse registered shares and ADSs and InCentive bearer shares tendered into its failed offers. On August 31, 2003, Zimmer entered into an agreement (the "Agreement"), attached to this Form 8-K as exhibit 99.1, with Rene Braginsky, Hans Kaiser, "Zurich" Versicherungs-Gesellschaft and III Institutional Investors International Corp. (collectively, the "Shareholders" and, together with Zimmer, the "Parties"), who collectively hold approximately 77% of InCentive's issued share capital. The Shareholders had been parties to a similar agreement with Smith & Nephew plc and Smith & Nephew Group plc (collectively, "Smith & Nephew") in connection with Smith & Nephew's now-failed exchange offer for InCentive. Pursuant to the Agreement, among other things: - Zimmer agreed to declare the InCentive Offer unconditional on the fourth business day following the expiration of the additional acceptance period for the InCentive Offer. - Zimmer agreed to comply with the Swiss Federal Banking Commission's ruling, dated August 15, 2003, relating to the InCentive Offer, and the Parties agreed to waive all rights to appeal any such ruling. - The Shareholders agreed not to: o acquire any Centerpulse registered shares or rights to acquire Centerpulse registered shares or, other than by way of settlement of the Offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any Centerpulse registered shares; or o acquire any InCentive bearer shares or rights to acquire InCentive bearer shares or, other than by way of the settlement of the InCentive Offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any InCentive bearer shares until the expiration of a period of six months following the end of the additional acceptance period of the InCentive Offer, subject to certain exceptions. - The Shareholders made certain representations and warranties to Zimmer setting forth, among other things, the manner in which the adjusted net asset value has been calculated for purposes of determining the consideration payable by Zimmer in the InCentive Offer and that neither InCentive nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities of any kind arising out of or in connection with any transaction entered into or completed prior to the settlement date of the InCentive Offer, other than those reflected, reserved or provisioned in the interim financial statements of InCentive as of August 27, 2003 and which reduce the adjusted net asset value of InCentive. The Agreement also contains other customary representations and warranties by the Shareholders. - The Shareholders agreed to indemnify Zimmer for, among other things, losses incurred by Zimmer as a result of any breach of the representations and warranties made by the Shareholders or any acquisition of shares of InCentive or Centerpulse by the Shareholders that causes Zimmer to be obligated under Swiss law to increase the offer price for the Offer or the InCentive Offer. - As security for the Shareholders' indemnification obligations, a portion of the consideration payable to the Shareholders in connection with the InCentive Offer will be deposited in escrow, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement to be entered into by the Parties. A form of the escrow agreement is attached to the Agreement as a schedule thereto. The aggregate amount to be deposited in escrow is CHF 25,000,000, subject to increase under certain circumstances. The Agreement sets forth how any payment out of the escrow amount will be apportioned among the Shareholders whose funds are escrowed. The Agreement also contains other customary terms and conditions. The summary of the Agreement set forth in this Form 8-K is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Agreement, which is attached to this Form 8-K as exhibit 99.1, and is specifically incorporated herein by reference. The above announcements were made in a press release, which is attached hereto as exhibit 99.2.

REGARDING A PUBLIC TENDER OFFER TO ALL SHAREHOLDERS OF INCENTIVE CAPITAL AG
-2- WHEREAS: (A) Zimmer is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Warsaw, Indiana, whose shares of common stock, par value USD 0.01 per share (the "ZIMMER SHARES"), are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. (B) Centerpulse AG ("CENTERPULSE") is a Swiss company limited by shares with registered seat in Zurich whose share capital amounts to CHF 354,919,350, divided into 11,830,645 registered shares with a par value of CHF 30 each (the "CENTERPULSE SHARES"), listed on the SWX Swiss Exchange and, in the form of American Depository Receipts, on the New York Stock Exchange. (C) Desirous to combine its business with the business of Centerpulse, Zimmer submitted, on 19 June 2003, a public tender offer for all publicly held Centerpulse Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in an offer prospectus dated 19 June 2003 (as amended, the "CENTERPULSE PROSPECTUS") (the "CENTERPULSE TENDER OFFER"). (D) InCentive Capital AG ("INCENTIVE"), a Swiss company limited by shares with registered seat in Zug whose share capital amounts to CHF 42,944,040, divided into 2,147,202 fully paid-up bearer shares with a par value of CHF 20 each which are listed on the SWX Swiss Exchange (the "INCENTIVE SHARES"), holds 2,237,577 Centerpulse Shares, representing 18.91% of the voting rights and capital stock of Centerpulse. (E) Concurrently with the Centerpulse Tender Offer, on 19 June 2003, Zimmer submitted a public tender offer for all InCentive Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in an offer prospectus dated 19 June 2003 (as amended, the "INCENTIVE PROSPECTUS") (the "PUBLIC TENDER OFFER"). (F) Following extended proceedings in relation to the Centerpulse Tender Offer and the Public Tender Offer, the Federal Banking Commission, in a ruling dated 15 August 2003 (the "FBC RULING"), decided, inter alia, that the Public Tender Offer has to be partially amended, which ruling is, however, subject to an appeal before the Federal Supreme Court.
-3- (G) The Shareholders, who hold in the aggregate 1,650,190 InCentive Shares, representing approximately 76.85% of the voting rights and capital stock of InCentive, all as set forth in Schedule (D), and Zimmer have determined that it is in the best interest of all the parties to remove the uncertainty caused by the fact that the FBC Ruling may be appealed and the appeal period will expire only after the expiry of the Centerpulse Offer and the Public Tender Offer. NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows: 1. DEFINED TERMS As used in this Agreement, the capitalised terms shall have the meaning set forth in Schedule 1. 2. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC TENDER OFFER BY ZIMMER 2.1. THE OFFER PRICE The price offered under the Public Tender Offer will be determined in accordance with section 2.3 of the InCentive Prospectus (as amended), provided that the adjusted net asset value of InCentive as of the last day of the Offer Period of CHF 115,490,610, as it has been determined by InCentive and confirmed by PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Report, (the "ADJUSTED NAV") shall be final and binding upon the Parties for all purposes. 2.2. CONDITIONS OF THE PUBLIC TENDER OFFER The Parties confirm and agree that the conditions of the Public Tender Offer set forth in section 2.5 of the InCentive Prospectus (the "INCENTIVE CONDITIONS") are satisfied . Zimmer shall declare the Public Tender Offer unconditional on the fourth Business Day following the expiration of the Offer Period.
-4- 2.3. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FBC RULING Zimmer shall comply in all respects with the FBC Ruling. The Parties hereby waive their right to appeal against the FBC Ruling. 2.4.

If the cash to be deducted under paragraph (a) of this Section 3.2 exceeds the cash payable to the relevant Shareholder, Zimmer may sell sufficient Zimmer Shares to realise an adequate amount of cash.
-5- 3.3. NON-SOLICITATION Each Shareholder agrees that it shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and communications between itself or any of its subsidiaries and any persons with respect to any Acquisition Transaction (as defined below) other than with respect to the public tender offer for InCentive submitted by Smith & Nephew. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, none of the Shareholders or their respective subsidiaries shall solicit or initiate any discussions or negotiations with any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group (other than Zimmer or any affiliate or associate of Zimmer) concerning any merger, consolidation, business combination, liquidation, reorganisation, sale of substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transaction involving InCentive or any subsidiary of InCentive (each an "ACQUISITION TRANSACTION"), provided that nothing contained in this Section 3.3 shall restrict InCentive's board of directors in taking and disclosing to InCentive's shareholders or any third parties or governmental or regulatory bodies a position with respect to an Acquisition Transaction initiated by a third party, or in making such other disclosure to InCentive's shareholders or any third parties or governmental or regulatory bodies, which, as advised by outside counsel, is advisable under applicable law. 3.4. NO ACQUISITION OR DISPOSAL OF SHARES Unless Zimmer shall have given its prior written consent or declared that the Public Tender Offer has failed, none of the Shareholders or any of their respective subsidiaries shall, after the Signing Date: (a) acquire any Centerpulse Shares or rights to acquire Centerpulse Shares or, other than by way of the settlement of the Centerpulse Tender Offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any Centerpulse Shares; or (b) acquire any InCentive Shares or rights to acquire InCentive Shares or, other than by way of the settlement of the Public Tender Offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any InCentive Shares; provided (i) that each Shareholder shall have the right to acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of any Centerpulse Shares and/or any InCentive Shares and/or any

Prior to the publication of any offer document, Zimmer shall consult with InCentive and the Shareholders with respect to, and shall give InCentive and the Shareholders reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, information in the offer documents relating to InCentive and the Shareholders, respectively. 3.6. DETERMINATION OF THE ADJUSTED NAV AND ESTABLISHMENT OF INTERIM FINANCIALS The Adjusted Net Asset Value has been determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Public Tender Offer and confirmed by PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Report and shall be final and binding on the Parties for all purposes. 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SHAREHOLDERS Each of RB, HK and III represents and warrants, severally and not jointly, and as regards Section 4(c) (Legal Title) only with respect to the InCentive Shares held by himself and not with respect to the InCentive Shares held by the other Shareholders, that each of the following statements is true and correct, and Z represents and warrants only as regards Section 4(c) (Legal Title) with respect to the InCentive Shares held by itself (and not with respect to any other Section or the InCentive Shares held by the other Shareholders), except as otherwise set forth hereafter, both on the Signing Date and on the Settlement Date:

The 2002 Financials have been and the Interim Financials will be established in conformity with IAS consistently applied, save, in respect of the Interim Financials, for any inconsistencies and deviations from IAS which are due to the fact that the Interim Financials are interim financial statements and not year-end financial statements.
-8- (e) Determination of the Adjusted NAV The Adjusted NAV has been determined in accordance with Schedule 4(e). Save as otherwise set forth in such schedule, the methods and principles for determining the Adjusted NAV correspond to the methods and principles which were consistently applied by InCentive for determining the per share net asset value of the InCentive group prior to the Signing Date. (f) Absence of Liabilities As of the Settlement Date, none of InCentive or any of its subsidiaries has any debts, obligations or liabilities, whether due or future, actual or contingent, arising out of or in connection with any transaction entered into or completed prior to the Settlement Date other than those reflected, reserved or provisioned in the Interim Financials and which reduce the Adjusted NAV. (g) Compliance with Laws Except for matters which would not have a material adverse effect, InCentive has, to the best knowledge of the Shareholders, complied with and is presently in compliance with all laws, regulations, reporting and licensing requirements and orders applicable to it. (h) Taxes All tax returns required to be filed prior to or on 31 December 2002 by or with respect to InCentive or any of its subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or prior to 31 December 2002 have been timely filed. All taxes shown to be due on such tax returns on or prior to 31 December 2002, or which have been or will be assessed by the competent tax authorities with respect to such tax returns, have been timely paid or fully provisioned against.

(l) No Further Representations and Warranties No representations are made or warranties given, whether express or implied, other than those made or given in this Section 4.
-10- 5. INDEMNIFICATION IN CASE OF BREACH OF WARRANTIES 5.1. INDEMNITY OBLIGATION Subject to the provisions of Section 5.2 to Section 5.5, each Shareholder (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Z) agrees severally, and not jointly with the other Shareholders, to indemnify and hold harmless Zimmer, in the proportions set forth in par. 3) of Schedule 6.1(b), against claims for breaches of the representations given by RB, HK and III under Section 4, except, as regards Section 4(c) (Legal Title), only with respect to the InCentive Shares held by himself and not with respect to the InCentive Shares held by the other Shareholders. 5.2. TERM AND NOTIFICATION PERIOD 5.2.1.The representations and warranties set forth in Section 4 (other than with respect to the title warranty in Section 4(c) or fraud pursuant to article 28 CO) shall be valid for a period of 36 months from the Settlement Date. If Zimmer fails so to notify the Shareholders prior to the last Business Day of such 36 months period, it shall be deemed to have waived, and shall be precluded from raising, any claim or right against the Shareholders for misrepresentation or breach of warranty in respect of such claim. 5.2.2.Should Zimmer detect any misrepresentation or breach of warranty, or should a third party raise or threaten in writing to Zimmer or any of its subsidiaries to raise a claim which is reasonably likely to give rise to a claim for misrepresentation or breach of warranty, then, following 31 March 2004, Zimmer shall be obliged, within 90 Business Days from having obtained reasonable knowledge of the circumstances of such misrepresentation or breach of warranty or of such third party claim, to notify the Shareholders in writing describing the facts or the claim in reasonable detail. If Zimmer fails to so notify the Shareholders, it shall be deemed to have waived any claim or right against the Shareholders for misrepresentation or breach of warranty in respect of such claim, unless Zimmer is able to show that the Shareholders have not actually been prejudiced by such failure. 5.2.3.No statutory examination or notification requirements apply. The provisions contained in this Section 5.2 shall supersede the provisions of articles 201 and
-11- 210 CO which shall not be applicable to this Agreement. The Shareholders explicitly waive Articles 201 and 210 CO. 5.3. LIMITATIONS (a) The obligation of each Shareholder to indemnify pursuant to Section 5 is limited as follows: (i) other than in the case of Section 4(f), only claims which on a stand-alone basis exceed the amount of CHF 50,000 may be made, it being understood that any and all claims exceeding such amount shall be taken into account in full. For the purposes of this Section several claims based on the same set of facts or origin shall be deemed to be one claim; (ii) each Shareholder shall severally, but not jointly with the other Shareholders, be liable for such damages in the proportion set forth in par. 3) of Schedule 6.1(b), however not exceeding the escrow amount paid on behalf of such Shareholder into the escrow account under the Escrow Agreements; (iii) the maximum liability of a Shareholder (other than in respect to the warranty given in respect to legal title in accordance with Section 4(c) and fraud committed by such Shareholder pursuant to article 28 CO) shall be limited to, and under no circumstances exceed, the amount held in escrow of such Shareholder as set forth in Schedule 6.1(b). (b) If facts and circumstances which would give rise to a claim against the Shareholders result in any financial benefits or financial advantages to InCentive or Zimmer, then any damages will be reduced by the amount equal to any such benefits and advantages. In addition, the Shareholders shall not be liable in respect of a claim of Zimmer for misrepresentation or breach of warranty: (i) if and to the extent that such claim is covered by any specific provision, reserve or expense in the 2002 Financials or the Interim Finan-
-12- cials relating to such claim, or if and to the extent such claim can be compensated to the extent permitted by law and applicable accounting principles consistently applied dissolving provisions made for any purpose in the 2002 Financials or the Interim Financials; (ii) if and to the extent that such claim is provided for or reflected in the Adjusted NAV; (iii) if and to the extent that costs, damages and expenses have been recovered from a third party (including without limitation an insurance company), after deduction of all direct costs and expenses incurred in making such recovery (including reasonable attorney's fees); (iv) if and to the extent that, as a result of a claim for misrepresentation or breach of warranty, any tax payable by InCentive or its subsidiaries is or will be reduced; or (v) if and to the extent that any damage or loss has been caused or increased by the fact that Zimmer shall have failed to comply, or cause InCentive or its subsidiaries to comply with, the duty to mitigate the damage caused by a misrepresentation or breach of warranty. 5.4. THIRD PARTY CLAIMS If any claim is raised by a third party against InCentive which has been notified by Zimmer pursuant to Section 5.2, the following provisions of this Section 5.4 shall apply: (a) if the aggregate level of claims made by third parties has not exceeded, nor is it likely to exceed, CHF 500,000, the Shareholders, represented for such purpose by InCentive Asset Management AG, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts in assisting Zimmer or InCentive in the defence of such claim. Zimmer shall not, and shall procure that InCentive does not, settle any such claim without prior written consultation with the Shareholders, represented for such purpose by InCentive Asset Management AG.
-13- (b) If the aggregate level of claims made by third parties has exceeded or is likely to exceed CHF 500,000 but is unlikely to exceed CHF 15,000,000, and if the Shareholders, represented for such purpose by InCentive Asset Management AG, acknowledge their liability in writing and deliver to Zimmer and the Escrow Agent an instruction in writing instructing the Escrow Agent to release to Zimmer an amount equivalent to the liability as shall be agreed or adjudicated at the time of such agreement or adjudication, then the Shareholders, represented for such purpose by InCentive Asset Management AG, shall have the right to compromise or defend, at their own cost and expense and by their own counsel, any such matter. If the Shareholders are willing to compromise or defend any asserted liability, they shall promptly notify Zimmer of their intention to do so, and Zimmer shall co-operate with, and provide at the cost and expense of the Shareholders appropriate documentation and support as reasonably requested by the Shareholders, represented for such purpose by InCentive Asset Management AG, or their counsel in connection with the compromise or defence of such asserted liability. Zimmer shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in the defence of such asserted liability. (c) If the aggregate level of claims made by third parties has exceeded or is likely to exceed CHF 15,000,000, and if Zimmer so elects, then Zimmer shall have the right to compromise or defend, at its own cost and expense, and by its own counsel, any such matter. In such circumstances, the Shareholders shall co-operate with, and provide at the cost and expense of Zimmer, appropriate documentation and support as reasonably requested by Zimmer, in connection with the compromise or defence of such asserted liability. (d) Zimmer may direct the Shareholders to agree to compromise any asserted liability against InCentive or its subsidiaries at any time, provided that Zimmer at the same time waives its rights for indemnification from the Shareholders for misrepresentation or breach of warranty under this Agreement.
-14- 5.5. REMEDIES EXCLUSIVE The remedies set forth in this Section 5 shall be in lieu of any remedies provided for by the law. All remedies provided for by the law including, without limitation, the right to rescind this Agreement, are explicitly waived. 5.6. INDEMNIFICATION AND NO RECOURSE AMONG SHAREHOLDERS 5.6.1.Z shall not have any claim or recourse against any of the other Shareholders in the event that amounts are drawn from Z's escrow account under Z's Escrow Agreement, except under the circumstances set forth in Section 5.6.2. 5.6.2.Should the escrow amounts deposited on the escrow accounts under the Escrow Agreements on the account of any of the Shareholders be claimed by and released to Zimmer as a result of a fraudulent or grossly negligent breach of Section 4 (other than a breach of Section 4(c) by Z), then the Shareholder who committed such breach shall indemnify Z for the escrow amount deposited on the account of Z as if no breach of Section 4 had occurred. 6. ESCROW 6.1.

"We believe very strongly in the strategic fit between Zimmer and Centerpulse, and we are very pleased that our proposed acquisition has been met with overwhelming support by the shareholders of Centerpulse, InCentive and Zimmer," said Ray Elliott, Chairman, President and CEO of Zimmer. "We look forward to integrating Centerpulse's business with ours to create the world's number one pure play orthopaedics company." In accordance with the terms of Zimmer's offers, Zimmer is providing a subsequent offering period for each offer of ten Swiss trading days in order to provide shareholders of Centerpulse and InCentive Capital who have not tendered their shares during the initial offering period with the opportunity to tender their shares into Zimmer's offers. The subsequent offering period for each offer begins on Tuesday, September 2, 2003 and expires at 4:00 p.m., Central European Time, 10:00 a.m., New York City Time, on Monday, September 15, 2003.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT This press release contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the orthopaedics industry, management's beliefs and assumptions made by management. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as "may," "will," "expects," "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "estimates," "projects," "targets," "forecasts," and "seeks" or the negative of such terms or other variations on such terms or comparable terminology. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, price and product competition, rapid technological development, demographic changes, dependence on new product development, the mix of our products and services, supply and prices of raw materials and products, customer demand for our products and services, our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies, control of costs and expenses, our ability to form and implement alliances, international growth, U.S. and foreign government regulation, product liability and intellectual property litigation losses, reimbursement levels from third-party payors, general industry and market conditions and growth rates and general domestic and international economic conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations. In particular, forward-looking statements as to Zimmer's financial and business performance following the proposed acquisitions should be qualified by the absence of the opportunity for Zimmer to perform comprehensive due diligence on Centerpulse or InCentive Capital AG, a significant shareholder of Centerpulse. These forward looking statements might have been significantly different had such due diligence review been undertaken. For a further list and description of such risks and uncertainties, see the disclosure materials filed by
Zimmer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Zimmer disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers of this document are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, since, while we believe the assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, there can be no assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this document. This press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. Any exchange offer will be made only through a registration statement and related materials. Zimmer and its directors, officers and other members of its management and employees also may be soliciting proxies from Zimmer stockholders in connection with the exchange offers for shares of Centerpulse and InCentive Capital.
