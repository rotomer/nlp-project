ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
     On October 22, 2003, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. reported its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. Zimmer's earnings release for the quarter is attached as Exhibit 99(a) and the information set forth therein is incorporated herein by reference and constitutes a part of this report. The attached Exhibit is furnished pursuant to Item 9 and Item 12 of Form 8-K.
     The earnings release attached as Exhibit 99(a) discloses the non-GAAP financial measures of Free Cash Flow, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) Margin, Adjusted Operating Profit Margin and Adjusted Net Earnings Margin, which have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities, Net Earnings, Operating Profit Margin and Net Earnings Margin, respectively. Management considers Free Cash Flow an important measure of cash flow available for debt repayment, acquisition funding and other investing and financing activities. Management considers EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Operating Profit Margin and Adjusted Net Earnings Margin important measures of profitability used by its investors, debt holders, debt rating agencies and stock analysts when analyzing Zimmer's financial performance and comparing it to those of Zimmer's competitors. However, these measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99(a)
(WARSAW, IN) October 22, 2003  Continued strength in reconstructive, Americas and European sales drove increases in net sales and earnings for Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SWX:ZMH), which today announced results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003. During the quarter, the final results of Zimmer's exchange offers for Centerpulse AG and InCentive Capital AG, were announced, indicating that nearly 99% of Centerpulse shares were tendered in favor of the acquisition. The acquisition was completed on October 2, 2003, establishing Zimmer as the worldwide #1 pure-play Orthopaedic company.
Third Quarter and Nine-Month Results
Net sales increased 18% (16% constant currency) for the third quarter to $398.2 million, topping First Call consensus estimates of $392 million, and increased 20% (16% constant currency) for the first nine months to $1,199.4 million.
 
Net earnings increased 31% to $85.0 million for the third quarter and increased 67% to $309.3 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2003. Excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for instruments recorded in the first quarter, net earnings for the first nine months increased 37% to $254.2 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 30% to $0.43 for the quarter versus $0.33 for the prior year and were $0.02 over First Call consensus estimates. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter reflect the inclusion of approximately $1.7 million in expenses associated with the acquisition and integration of Centerpulse. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months, including $3.2 million in expenses associated with the acquisition and integration of Centerpulse, increased 63% to $1.55 versus $0.95 for the prior year. Excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for instruments, diluted earnings per share for the first nine months increased 35% to $1.28.
"Our sales machine continues to perform extremely well," said Zimmer Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Ray Elliott. "We believe we are taking market share from our competitors, especially in the important reconstructive category. With the Zimmer formula, each new sales dollar contributes fifty cents of profit to the operating margin line, and on a year-to-year basis, has been the primary driver of free cash flow nearly doubling. Importantly, we achieved two of our long-standing strategic priorities with the acquisition of Centerpulsethat is, dramatically increasing our presence in the European market and establishing a recognized platform in the rapidly growing spinal market while incrementally adding an excellent new dental business. We have begun rapid, large-scale integration activities and look forward to taking advantage of the perfect fit' represented by the combination of our two companies."

Guidance
The company is providing sales and diluted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter 2003 and the full year 2004, as well as some general diluted earnings per share growth parameters for 2005 and 2006. As indicated in the company's second quarter earnings release, Zimmer sales without Centerpulse are expected to grow 15% in the fourth quarter, to approximately $425 million from $370 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2002. Centerpulse local currency sales growth in certain of the major European markets were flat in each of the first two quarters of this year, and this trend is expected to continue for the balance of
 
2003.Centerpulse sales in U.S. dollars for the fourth quarter are expected to increase 8% to 10%, including a less significant effect from foreign currency rate fluctuations than was experienced during the first half of 2003. This implies Centerpulse sales for the quarter of approximately $244 million, up from $224 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2002. On a consolidated basis, for the quarter, before giving effect to potential sales dis-synergies of approximately $10 million that may be experienced during the integration of Zimmer and Centerpulse, fourth quarter sales are expected to be approximately $669 million, or an increase of 12% to 13% from $594 million pro forma reported in the fourth quarter of 2002.
In keeping with the Zimmer's traditional expectations of growing 1% to 2% faster than the served market, sales growth in 2004 for the company without Centerpulse is expected to increase 12% to 13% to approximately $1.83 billion. Consistent with the company's past planning process, there is zero sales growth effect from foreign currency rate fluctuations assumed in 2004 over 2003. Centerpulse sales are expected to increase about 9% to approximately $1.01 billion. On a consolidated basis, before giving effect to potential sales dis-synergies that may be experienced during the integration of Zimmer and Centerpulse, 2004 sales are expected to be approximately $2.84 billion, 11% to 12% over pro forma 2003. The company may experience $40 million to $50 million of sales dis-synergies in 2004, as it integrates the distributors and sales representatives of both companies. This would result in 2004 sales of approximately $2.79 to $2.80 billion, and 10% over prior year.
Diluted earnings per share for Zimmer without Centerpulse for the fourth quarter 2003 are expected to be approximately $0.45, excluding acquisition and integration costs, representing a 22% increase over prior year. Consolidated diluted earnings per share including Centerpulse are expected to be approximately $0.44. Separate third quarter results for Centerpulse are not required to be released, due to Centerpulse's status as a foreign private issuer in the United States. Consolidated diluted earnings per share for 2004 are expected to be approximately $1.99, representing a 16% increase over 2003. Diluted earnings per share estimates for the fourth quarter of 2003 and the full year 2004 exclude acquisition and integration costs and certain non-recurring purchase accounting adjustments such as the write off of in-process R&D and inventory step up costs.
 
In 2004, the potential negative earnings impact of sales dis-synergies are expected to be offset by the first year of positive expense synergies, with the ultimate effect on 2004 diluted earnings per share being the same as Zimmer standalone. By 2006, sales dis-synergies are expected to decline to zero, while the full effect of the $70-$90 million of expected positive pre-tax expense synergies should be realized. Consequently, the anticipated 2004 EPS growth of 16%, is expected to increase to a range of 20% to 25% in 2005, driven by accelerating sales growth and incremental expense synergies, and has the potential to exceed 25% in 2006. The company believes the acquisition of Centerpulse will provide average growth in diluted earnings per share, over the next several years, well in excess of 20%.
