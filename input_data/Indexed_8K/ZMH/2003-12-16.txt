CENTERPULSE AG NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Accounting policies
These consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine month period ended September 30, 2003 are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and under the assumption that Centerpulse will continue to operate as a going concern.
The accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002. The business of Centerpulse faces a moderate level of seasonality. Due to the holiday season in Europe during the third quarter, the period July to September is typically the weakest within the year.
Income tax expense is recognized based on the best estimate of the weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year.
The consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Centerpulse's 2002 annual consolidated financial statements.
2. Segment information
Centerpulse's business is managed on a worldwide basis and structured into three operating segments. The Orthopaedics Division develops, manufactures and distributes hip, knee and other orthopaedic implants. The Spine-Tech Division develops and distributes spinal implants. The Dental Division develops, manufactures and distributes dental implants.
Centerpulse's other operating activities consist of biologic research and development and Centerpulse management, including the costs of holding, financing and managing Centerpulse entities.
Discontinued operations consist of the Cardiovascular Division, which developed, manufactured and distributed heart valves including repair products, vascular grafts and stents. The sale of the Cardiovascular Division was completed on January 21, 2003.

(unaudited; in millions CHF)
Segment Information
Sales of Discontinued Operations were CHF 7 million in 2003 and CHF 186 million in 2002.
3. Discontinued operations
On June 12, 2002, Centerpulse announced its plans to divest of the Cardiovascular Division and to focus on its core businesses of orthopaedics, spine and dental. On November 7, 2002, Centerpulse announced the closing of the sale of IntraTherapeutics, Inc. to ev3 Inc., a portfolio company of private equity firms including Warburg Pincus LLC and The Vertical Group. On November 18, 2002, Centerpulse announced the closing of the sale of Vascutek Ltd. to Terumo Corporation of Japan. On January 21, 2003, Centerpulse announced the closing of the sale of Carbomedics, Inc. and Mitroflow Corp. to Snia S.p.A., an Italian medical device company. With the sale of Carbomedics and Mitroflow the divestiture of the Cardiovascular Division was completed.
The impact of the businesses divested in January 2003 on the consolidated financial statements was as follows: Sales CHF 7 million, Operating loss CHF - -1 million, Assets CHF 92 million, thereof cash CHF 1 million, Liabilities CHF 26 million.
The pre-tax gain on the sale of Carbomedics and Mitroflow amounts to CHF 19 million. The USD 36 million subordinated loan, which was part of the purchase price, remains in the balance sheet in "Investments and other financial assets".
Table of Contents
CENTERPULSE AG NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
The total tax benefit recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2003 related to discontinued operations amounted to CHF 47 million.
4. Hip and knee implant litigation
During the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the total costs recognized for the hip and knee implant litigation were increased by approximately 10% from USD 873 million, which was originally reserved in 2001, to USD 963 million. The additional provision of USD 90 million, or CHF 123 million, covers estimated additional costs based on the US Class Action Settlement Agreement dated March 13, 2002, for hip and knee revisions in excess of 4,000 and revisions on reprocessed shells over 64. As of December 12, 2003, the Claims Administrator has received 4,114 likely valid claims for hips (cut-off date June 5, 2003) and knees (cut-off date November 17, 2003) and 164 claims for reprocessed shells (cut-off date September 8, 2004). The above amount also covers the costs of a court-approved agreement for 125 late reported revision surgeries. Under the terms of this agreement, Centerpulse will reimburse the Sulzer Settlement Trust with USD 250,000 for each revision surgery between 4,001 and 4,100. Centerpulse believes it has adequately provided for estimated liabilities associated with the hip and knee implant litigation.
5. Transaction cost/gain on contractual settlement
Expenses related to the acquisition of Centerpulse amounted to CHF 83 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2003, including CHF 44 million investment banking fees, CHF 10 million legal and accounting fees, CHF 20 million break-up fee and CHF 9 million of other acquisition expenses.
Out of a total contractual claim against ATS Medical of USD 23 million covering a payment period up to 2008, income of USD 7 million (CHF 10 million) was recorded at the end of June, 2003 reflecting the contractual settlement with ATS Medical.
Other exceptional expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled CHF 3 million.
6. Income tax benefit
The tax benefit recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 amounted to CHF 164 million. Centerpulse realized CHF 74 million of tax benefit as a result of electing to carry back its 2002 U.S. federal net operating loss for only 5 years versus 10 years, which resulted in more losses being carried forward to future years and less tax credits going unutilized due to the shorter carry back period. In addition, a tax benefit of CHF 47 million was realized from discontinued operations due to the utilization of capital loss carryovers against divestiture gains and the release of certain tax liabilities no longer required. The tax benefit also was the result of an operating loss at Centerpulse's U.S. operations and the realization of tax benefits on non-U.S. tax losses.
7. Provisions
Total current and non-current provisions increased from CHF 251 million at December 31, 2002 to CHF 323 million at September 30, 2003. The increase is mainly related to the increase of the
Table of Contents
CENTERPULSE AG NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
provision for the hip and knee implant litigation. In the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the provision was increased by CHF 123 million to reflect an increase in the number of estimated claims in excess of the claims covered by the settlement agreement and trust discussed in Note 4. The increase was partially offset by utilization of CHF 53 million, attributed primarily to the issuance of settlement payments.
8. Non-current and Current borrowings
Current and non-current borrowings, totaling CHF 557 million at December 31, 2002, have been paid down to CHF 425 million as of September 30, 2003. The payments were primarily funded by the cash proceeds from the disposal of Carbomedics and Mitroflow in January 2003, operating cash flows and the sale of long-term financial assets.
Borrowings that have been repaid during October 2003 have been reflected in Current borrowings as of September 30, 2003.
9. Options exercised
During the nine month period ended September 30, 2003, approximately 395,000 options were exercised at an average exercise price of CHF 142. This resulted in additional share capital of CHF 12 million (nominal share value CHF 30) and additional paid-in capital of CHF 44 million.
10. Differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP
Centerpulse's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differ in certain material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").
Reconciliation of net income:
(1) Impact of in-process research and development cost on goodwill
In accordance with IAS 22, the amount of "in-process research and development" included in the purchase price of acquisitions is considered a form of goodwill which Centerpulse amortizes over a twenty-year period. U.S. GAAP requires the entire "in-process research and development" amount to
Table of Contents
CENTERPULSE AG NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
be expensed in the year of acquisition. This difference reverses over the twenty-year period in which goodwill is amortized under IFRS.
(2) Impact of impairment charge on intangibles
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (FAS 121) "Accounting for the impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be disposed of" provides that an impairment is evaluated based on expectations of undiscounted cash flows. This test according to U.S. GAAP determined that in 2001 and 1999 no impairment has occurred and no impairment charges were recognized. This difference reverses over the remaining period in which these definite-lived intangible assets are amortized under IFRS.
(3) Impact of goodwill amortization
As of January 1, 2002, Centerpulse adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets". SFAS 142 requires that all goodwill and other intangible assets existing on implementation on January 1, 2002 be tested for impairment on an annual basis. From January 1, 2002 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized on a regular basis. For the purpose of the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, goodwill was generally amortized through the income statement over an estimated useful life of 20 years up to December 31, 2001. Therefore, there was no amortization charge in 2003 and 2002 under U.S. GAAP. The corresponding reversal of the regular goodwill amortization under IFRS resulted in additional income in the U.S. GAAP reconciliation of CHF 29 million and CHF 39 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
(4) Sale of Orquest
In accordance with IAS 39, during 2001 Centerpulse recognized an impairment relating to its investment in Orquest of USD 11 million. During 2002, evidence of a take-over of Orquest by a third party resulted in Centerpulse's estimate that a substantial part of the impairment was no longer required. In accordance with IAS 39, CHF 13 million was reversed and recorded as income. U.S. GAAP only allows the reversal of an impairment of a financial asset upon disposition. During 2003, Centerpulse sold a portion of its investment in Orquest resulting in CHF 11 million of additional income under U.S. GAAP.
(5) Option early vesting
If the defined vesting period of a fixed stock option award is subsequently accelerated, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 44 "Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation" ("FIN 44"), requires a new measurement of compensation cost as if the award was newly granted on the acceleration date and thereafter. APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", as interpreted by FIN 44, requires compensation expense to be recognized on the acceleration date and thereafter based upon the intrinsic value. Under IFRS, compensation expense is not recorded upon modification of stock options.
(6) Exceptional Legal Expense
Net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2002 has been restated to include CHF 40 million of exceptional legal expense (less tax benefit of CHF 14 million) incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2002 which was previously reported by Centerpulse as being incurred during the fourth quarter of 2002.
(7) Operating income
Operating income under IFRS also consists of the income from discontinued operations. Under U.S. GAAP, this income from the Cardiovascular division in 2003 and 2002 would not be included in the
Table of Contents
CENTERPULSE AG NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
operating income, and would be shown below operating income as income from discontinued operations.
Reconciliation of shareholders' equity:
The principal differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP are presented below with explanations of certain adjustments that affect consolidated shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002.
(a) In-process research & development
As discussed in the reconciliation of net income, the amount of "in-process research and development" is expensed in the year of acquisition under U.S. GAAP. This difference reverses over the period in which related goodwill is amortized under IFRS.
(b) Intangibles
As discussed in the reconciliation of net income, the impairment charge to goodwill and existing technology was not recognized under FAS 121.
(c) Goodwill
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142) "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" does not require goodwill to be amortized after January 1, 2002. Under IFRS, Centerpulse continues to amortize goodwill.
(d) Option re-pricing
In 2002, Centerpulse re-priced certain fixed stock option awards. In accordance with FIN 44, Centerpulse (for U.S. GAAP purposes) recorded compensation expense for the modified options calculated as (the amount of) the change in the intrinsic value of the options from the time of the modification to the date the modified option is exercised, forfeited or expires. IFRS does not require compensation expense to be recorded for re-priced stock options.
(e) Option early vesting
If the defined vesting period of a fixed stock option award is subsequently accelerated, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 44 "Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation" ("FIN 44"), requires a new measurement of compensation cost as if the award was newly granted on the acceleration date and thereafter. APB Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", as interpreted by FIN 44, requires compensation expense to be
Table of Contents
CENTERPULSE AG NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
recognized on the acceleration date and thereafter based upon the intrinsic value. Under IFRS, compensation expense is not recorded upon modification of stock options.
(f) Sale of Orquest
At the end of 2001, the investment in Orquest was impaired and USD 11 million written off. During 2002, evidence of a take-over of Orquest by a third party resulted in Centerpulse's estimate that a substantial part of the impairment was no longer required. CHF 13 million was reversed in line with IAS 39. U.S. GAAP only allows the reversal of an impairment of a financial asset upon disposition.
During 2003, Centerpulse sold a portion of its investment in Orquest resulting in an additional CHF 11 million of income under U.S. GAAP.
(g) Deferred taxes
In the consolidated financial statements, deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as long-term and have been presented as such in the assets and liabilities sections of the balance sheet. This presentation is in accordance with IAS 12, "Income Taxes." U.S. GAAP Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (FAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes," provides that deferred taxes must be separated into a current and a non-current amount based on the classification of the related asset or liability.
The presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with FAS 109 at September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002 would be as follows:
11. Commitments and contingencies
Centerpulse is subject to product liability and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business, for which Centerpulse maintains insurance, subject to self-insured retention limits. Centerpulse establishes accruals for product liability and other claims in conjunction with outside counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for open claims, related fees and for claims incurred but not reported. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of Centerpulse that these cases will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of Centerpulse. In addition to product liability, Centerpulse is subject to other lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which are expected to have, upon ultimate resolution, a material effect on Centerpulse's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The European orthpaedic industry is subject to various country-specific government regulations that pertain to, among other things, payment practices with physicians and healthcare providers in Europe. As is common in the industry, the former European orthopaedic division of Centerpulse historically
Table of Contents
CENTERPULSE AG NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
made payments to certain physicians in Europe under the terms of various royalty, consulting and other contracts and arrangements. In connection with its ongoing integration of the operations of Centerpulse, the Company has become aware that some of these payments have been made in cash or under contracts or arrangements that might not have been sufficiently documented or might have lacked the requisite consents or approvals of applicable regulatory authorities in the relevant jurisdictions. The Company has taken steps to assure that future payments are made in accordance with applicable government regulations. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the consequences of any historical payments, it is the opinion of the Company that the prior practices will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
12. Subsequent events
On October 2, 2003 (the "Closing Date"), Zimmer Holdings Inc. ("Zimmer") announced the closing of its exchange offer for Centerpulse. Zimmer also announced the closing of its exchange offer for InCentive Capital AG, renamed SAICP AG ("InCentive"), a company that beneficially owns 18.3 percent of the issued Centerpulse shares. As a result of the Exchange Offers, Zimmer beneficially owns 98.7 percent of the issued Centerpulse shares (including the Centerpulse shares owned by InCentive) and 99.9 percent of the issued InCentive shares. Pursuant to Swiss law, Zimmer has initiated the compulsory acquisition process to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Centerpulse and InCentive that it does not already own, and expects to complete this process in 2004.
Subsequent to the Closing Date, the former executive managements of Centerpulse and InCentive resigned and the former members of the Boards of Centerpulse and InCentive were replaced by designees of Zimmer. The contracts of employment of the Centerpulse executive committee included change in control provisions. The total remuneration amounted to CHF 24 million.
During October 2003, Zimmer refinanced the outstanding current and non-current borrowings of Centerpulse.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.
     The following sets forth pro forma condensed combined financial information (i) derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Zimmer Holdings Inc. (the "Company" or "Zimmer") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Zimmer for the nine month period ended September 30, 2003 and (ii) derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Centerpulse AG ("Centerpulse") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, which have been incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K/A, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Centerpulse for the nine month period ended September 30, 2003, which have been included in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2003 is based on the consolidated financial statements of Zimmer and the consolidated financial statements of Centerpulse and has been adjusted to give effect to the Exchange Offers as if they had occurred on September 30, 2003. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2003 are based on the consolidated financial statements of Zimmer and the consolidated financial statements of Centerpulse and have been adjusted to give effect to the Exchange Offers as if they had occurred on January 1, 2002.
     Centerpulse's consolidated financial statements, from which these pro forma financial statements are derived, were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), which differ in certain material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The necessary adjustments have been made within the pro forma financial statements to adjust the Centerpulse financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Significant differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, as they currently relate to Centerpulse, include, among other things:
Table of Contents
     The Centerpulse consolidated financial statements were prepared in Swiss francs and have been translated to U.S. dollars at the appropriate exchange rates. The pro forma condensed combined statements of earnings only include the continuing operations of Centerpulse acquired by Zimmer, and therefore differ from the historical consolidated financial statements of Centerpulse. Material acquisition and integration expenses and related tax effects directly resulting from the transaction have been excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of earnings. Certain reclassifications were made to the Centerpulse consolidated financial statements to conform them to Zimmer's presentation.
     The following pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of (i) results of operations and financial position that would have been achieved had the Exchange Offers taken place on the dates indicated or (ii) the future operations of the combined company.
     The acquisition of Centerpulse will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, the purchase price will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value. For purposes of this pro forma information, the total purchase price was estimated to be $3,449 million and preliminary estimates were made regarding the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The actual fair values may vary from the preliminary estimates. The purchase price was estimated on the basis of cash paid to Centerpulse and InCentive shareholders of $1,187 million, Zimmer shares exchanged of $2,224 million and direct acquisition costs of $38 million.
     Certain costs related to the integration of Zimmer and Centerpulse have not been reflected in the pro forma financial information below as the timing and effect of actions associated with integration are as yet uncertain. However, these costs, as further described in the Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Earnings are expected to be significant.
     Operating results for InCentive for the year ended December 31, 2002 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 have been excluded from the pro forma financial information as the assets acquired in the Exchange Offers consisted of only Centerpulse registered shares and cash. The effects of the Centerpulse shares and cash acquired by Zimmer in the InCentive Offer have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.
The following pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with:

U.S. GAAP and Reclassification Adjustments
     (a) Centerpulse's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differ in certain material respects from U.S. GAAP. Centerpulse also classified certain costs differently than Zimmer in their consolidated statement of earnings. The following schedule summarizes the necessary material adjustments to conform the Centerpulse consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2002 to U.S. GAAP and to reclassify certain costs to Zimmer's basis of presentation.

Other Adjustments
     (b) Reflects an estimated increase of $2 million in depreciation expense resulting from the step-up of property, plant and equipment to their respective estimated fair values, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS No. 141"), offset by the elimination of $(3) million of amortization on existing intangible assets in the historical consolidated financial statements of Centerpulse.
     (c) Reflects an estimated $32 million of amortization expense related to estimated technology, trademark and customer related intangible assets over periods ranging from seven to thirty years. Also, effective January 1, 2003, Zimmer changed its accounting policy for loaner instruments from an expense based method to an asset based method. See note 4 to Zimmer's September 30, 2003 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed discussion of the accounting change. The adjustment reflects the impact on Zimmer's instrument expense, $(5) million, assuming the new asset-based accounting policy had been applied from the beginning of the period.
     (d) Reflects the elimination of interest expense on existing borrowings replaced by estimated interest expense on approximately $1,338 million in total debt incurred under the new Zimmer $1.75 billion senior credit facility. The $1.75 billion Zimmer credit facility contains: (i) $400 million 364-day revolving credit facility, (ii) $800 million three-year revolving credit facility and (iii) $550 million five-year term loan facility. Based on Zimmer's current investment grade rating from Standard and Poor's and from Moody's, the applicable interest rate and facility fees under the revolving facilities is LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points, and under the term loan, is LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points. Interest expense was calculated using a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.1 percent, calculated on constant debt levels throughout the year. Interest expense also includes amortization of debt issuance costs. A 1/8 percent change in the annual interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately $2 million. A summary of the various elements comprising the interest adjustment follows:
     (e) Reflects the income tax effects of adjustments based upon the statutory tax rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2002.
     (f) The increase in weighted average common shares outstanding for the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations reflects the issuance of 44,538,770 shares of Zimmer common stock issued in the Exchange Offers.

Other transaction related costs
     The objective of the pro forma information provided herein is to provide information about the continuing impact of the Exchange Offers by showing how it might have affected historical operating results if the Exchange Offers had been consummated at the beginning of the most recent full fiscal year. As such, charges directly resulting from the transaction are necessarily excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of earnings. Zimmer expects to incur non-cash charges directly resulting from the transaction as of and within the twelve-month period succeeding the transaction, estimated as follows:
     Refer to note (k) under Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet for further description of in-process research and development.
     The step-up of inventories to their respective fair values, as required by SFAS No. 141, results in an increase in cost of products sold as the inventory is sold to third party customers, which is expected to occur within the twelve month period succeeding the transaction.
     Retention payments and other employee related costs, costs for lease terminations, meetings, training, re-branding, integration of information technology systems, and other cash costs are anticipated in connection with the integration of Zimmer and Centerpulse. Pending final management approval of the integration plans, certain costs, estimated to amount to $140 million, are expected to be reported as acquisition and integration expense. Additional costs, estimated to amount to $60 million, are expected to be added to the Centerpulse purchase price in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company expects to incur an estimated $10 to $12 million associated with the ongoing informal SEC investigation of Centerpulse.

U.S. GAAP and Reclassification Adjustments
(a) Centerpulse's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differ in certain material respects from U.S. GAAP. Centerpulse also classified certain amounts differently than Zimmer in their consolidated balance sheet. The following schedule summarizes the necessary material adjustments to conform the Centerpulse consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2003 to U.S. GAAP and to reclassify certain amounts to Zimmer's basis of presentation.

Other Adjustments
     (b) Reflects the adjustment to state Centerpulse inventory at its estimated fair market value as of the acquisition date in accordance with SFAS No. 141.
     (c) Reflects the capitalization of $20 million of debt issuance costs ($10 million current and $10 million non-current) that will be amortized over the life of the $1.75 billion senior credit facility.
     (d) Reflects the adjustment to state Centerpulse property, plant and equipment at its estimated fair market value as of the acquisition date in accordance with SFAS 141.
     (e) Intangible assets are adjusted to reflect an estimated allocation of: (i) $275 million to brand assets encompassing the trademarks and trade names of Centerpulse, of which $243 million are considered to have an indefinite useful life and $32 million are expected to have estimated useful lives of approximately 11 years, (ii) $424 million to technology assets comprised of current product technology with an expected useful life of approximately fourteen years and core technology that is expected to have a useful life of approximately nineteen years and (iii) $34 million to customer related intangible assets which represents the value of relationships with customers that are expected to have a useful life of thirty years.
     (f) These amounts reflect the estimates necessary to record the Centerpulse assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. In accordance with EITF 99-12, "Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination", the fair value of the Company's common stock issued pursuant to the Exchange Offers was estimated to be $49.93 per share based upon the market price of the Company's common stock over a reasonable period of time two days before and after the date when sufficient Centerpulse and InCentive shares had been tendered to make the Exchange Offers binding (August 27, 2003). The purchase price was estimated and allocated as follows:

     Centerpulse's unaudited consolidated statement of earnings for the nine month period ended September 30, 2003 includes a $90 million provision in selling, general and administrative expense for hip and knee implant litigation, including $45 million in the third quarter.
     Centerpulse's unaudited consolidated statement of earnings for the nine month period ended September 30, 2003 includes $90 million of acquisition expenses, comprised of: (i) $33 million investment banking fees, (ii) $7 million legal and accounting fees, (iii) $15 million break-up fee, (iv) $29 million of compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of certain Centerpulse stock options, and (v) $6 million of other acquisition expenses.
     Centerpulse recognized a significant tax benefit for the nine month period ended September 30, 2003. Centerpulse realized $54 million as a result of electing to carry back its 2002 U.S. federal net operating loss for only 5 years versus 10 years, which resulted in more losses being carried forward to future years and less tax credits going unutilized due to the shorter carry back period. The remaining tax benefit primarily results from the operating loss at Centerpulse's U.S. operations and the realization of tax benefits on non-U.S. tax losses.

     (d) Reflects the elimination of $93 million of acquisition and integration costs that were expensed in the Zimmer and Centerpulse consolidated financial statements.

     (e) Reflects the elimination of interest expense on existing borrowings replaced by estimated interest expense on approximately $1,081 million in total average outstanding debt ($1,338 million assumed to be incurred at January 1, 2002 less the scheduled maturity of $257 million on the 364-day revolving credit facility) under the new Zimmer $1.75 billion senior credit facility. The $1.75 billion Zimmer credit facility contains: (i) $400 million 364-day revolving credit facility, (ii) $800 million three-year revolving credit facility and (iii) $550 million five-year term loan facility. Based on Zimmer's current investment grade rating from Standard and Poor's and from Moody's, the applicable interest rate and facility fees under the revolving facilities is LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points, and under the term loan, is LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points. Interest expense was calculated using a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.1 percent, calculated on constant average outstanding debt levels throughout the year. Interest expense also includes amortization of debt issuance costs. A 1/8 percent change in the annual interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately $1 million.
