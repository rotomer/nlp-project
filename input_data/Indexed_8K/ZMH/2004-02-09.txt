SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report: (Date of earliest event reported): February 9, 2004 ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware 001-16407 13-4151777 (State or other (Commission (IRS Employer jurisdiction of File Number) Identification No.) incorporation) 345 East Main Street, Warsaw, Indiana 46580 (Address of principal executive offices) Registrant's telephone number, including area code: 574/267-6131 Former name or former address, if changed since last report: N/A
ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (c) Exhibits 99(a) Press Release, dated February 9, 2004, issued by the Registrant ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On February 9, 2004, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the "Registrant") reported its results of operations for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2003. The Registrant's earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99(a) and the information set forth therein is incorporated herein by reference and constitutes a part of this report. As previously announced, the Registrant completed its acquisitions of Centerpulse AG and InCentive Capital AG on October 2, 2003. The earnings release attached as Exhibit 99(a) includes comparative sales information to prior year for the Registrant and Centerpulse on a combined basis, information reflected in its statements of earnings and guidance for diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis excluding the impact of the following which relates to the Centerpulse acquisition: inventory step-up; in-process research and development write offs; acquisition and integration expenses; and related income tax benefits. The press release also reports sales growth measurements on a basis that eliminates the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods. Management believes that the presentation of the combined and adjusted information allows investors to more easily compare the Registrant's performance on a period to period basis. It also aids investors in understanding the operating results of the Registrant, absent the specific acquisition related items as detailed above as well as the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations between periods. However, these measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. All of the non-GAAP financial measures, except for the 2005 and 2006 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance, are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release. The Company's GAAP diluted earnings per share for 2005 and 2006 are not currently determinable because acquisition and integration expenses for those periods are not yet finalized. As a result, a reconciliation of the adjusted diluted earning per share guidance for 2005 and 2006 to GAAP diluted earnings per share for those periods can not be performed without unreasonable effort. The Registrant is furnishing the information contained in this report, including the Exhibits, pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC. By filing this report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, the Registrant makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in this report, including the Exhibits. 2
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized. ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. Dated: February 9, 2004 By: /s/ Sam R. Leno ---------------------------------- 3

(WARSAW, IN) February 9, 2004 -- Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SWX:ZMH) today reported net sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003, exceeding First Call consensus estimates. The company's reported results reflect its acquisitions of both Centerpulse AG and InCentive Capital AG, which closed on October 2, 2003. The company is also providing a comparison of sales to prior year on a combined* basis, incorporating sales for Centerpulse in the fourth quarter 2002. Reported results include acquisition and integration expenses, in-process R&D write-offs, inventory step-up and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, as applicable. "Zimmer continues to deliver on the expectations communicated when we became a public company in 2001--our financial performance is at the top of the medical device industry, we have greatly expanded our market presence in Europe, we have entered the rapidly growing spinal market and, in our first quarter of consolidated results, we grew combined* reconstructive sales 20%," said Ray Elliott, Zimmer Chairman, President and CEO. "As a result of continued strong operating cash flow, cash acquired as part of the Centerpulse AG and InCentive Capital AG transactions, and the initial monetization of Centerpulse tax loss carryforwards, we paid down nearly 20% of our acquisition-related borrowings in the first quarter of consolidated operations. Our momentum is strong." A significant initiative for Zimmer has been its program for Minimally Invasive Solutions(TM) (MIS(TM)) Procedures and Technologies. During the year, the company opened its Zimmer Institute and the number of surgeons trained to perform the Zimmer MIS(TM) 2-Incision Hip procedure and the Zimmer MIS Quad-Sparing (Q-S (TM)) Total Knee Replacement procedure totaled nearly 600. The Zimmer MIS Quad-Sparing Knee procedure will be formally launched in March at the annual American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting. More recently, the company was granted a Method and Apparatus patent for its unique MIS 2-Incision Hip procedure by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
"Our integration of the Centerpulse acquisition remains ahead of schedule with the strategic value becoming a reality, including both the anticipated synergies and dis-synergies," said Elliott. "We have over 100 full-time integration team members actively executing on more than 250 discrete integration projects, and we are on our way to functioning as a unified, global orthopaedic powerhouse." Due to the acquisition of Centerpulse, net sales for geographic segments and product categories are presented in tabular format as follows for comparison of both reported and combined* results. FOURTH QUARTER NET SALES RESULTS
Net earnings for the quarter were $37 million on a reported basis, and were $125 million adjusted*, an increase of 72% over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.15 reported, and were $0.51 adjusted*, an increase of 38% over the prior year. FULL-YEAR NET SALES RESULTS Net earnings for the year were $346 million on a reported basis, and were $381 million adjusted*, an increase of 48% over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the year were $1.38 reported (before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for instruments), and were $1.80 adjusted*, an increase of 37% over the prior year.
GUIDANCE The company announced that it was increasing its sales and earnings guidance for the full year 2004. Full-year sales are projected to be in a range of $2,850 million to $2,900 million, and reported diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.61 to $1.64, reflecting estimated acquisition and integration expenses of $79 million and inventory step-up of $35 million, net of tax, and adjusted* diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $2.07 to $2.10. First quarter 2004 sales are expected to be in a range of $690 to $705 million. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2004 are expected to be $0.26 to $0.27 on a reported basis and $0.47 to $0.48 adjusted*, excluding inventory step-up expenses and acquisition and integration expenses of $33 million and $18 million, respectively, after tax. The company also said it was reaffirming its forecast of 2005 diluted earnings per share growth in the range of 20 to 25%, with the potential to exceed 25% adjusted* diluted earnings per share growth in 2006.
