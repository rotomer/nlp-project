(the "Company"), Zimmer, Inc., Zimmer K.K., Zimmer Ltd., Zimmer Switzerland Holdings Ltd., Zimmer Investment Luxembourg S.C.A, Zimmer GmbH and the borrowing subsidiaries and subsidiary guarantors named therein entered into a $1.35 billion amended and restated credit agreement with the lenders named therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Tokyo Branch, as administrative agent for the Japanese lenders and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as administrative agent for the European lenders (the "Amended and Restated Facility"). A copy of the Amended and Restated Facility is included as Exhibit 10.1 to this filing and is incorporated herein by reference.
      The Amended and Restated Facility, which contains provisions by which the borrowing thereunder may be increased to $1.75 billion, further amends and restates the amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement dated as of May 24, 2004 among the Company, Zimmer, Inc., Zimmer K.K., Zimmer Ltd., Zimmer Switzerland Holdings Ltd. (formerly known as Centerpulse Ltd.), the borrowing subsidiaries named therein, the lenders named therein and the administrative agents named therein (the "Prior Facility"). The Prior Facility consisted of an $800 million three-year revolving credit facility maturing June 2006 and a $550 million five-year term loan facility maturing June 2008. In connection with the execution of the Amended and Restated Facility, the Company terminated the $400 million 364-day revolving credit facility dated as of May 24, 2004 among the Company, Zimmer, Inc., the borrowing subsidiaries named therein, the lenders named therein and the administrative agents named therein (the "364-Day Agreement"). The 364-Day Agreement was scheduled to mature in May 2005. The Company did not incur any early termination or prepayment penalties in connection with the termination of the 364-Day Agreement.
      Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Facility will be used for general corporate purposes and may bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the Company's senior unsecured long-term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the Amended and Restated Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The Amended and Restated Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets, as defined in the Amended and Restated Facility. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If the Company falls below an investment grade credit rating, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends, as defined in the Amended and Restated Facility.

If requested by the Issuing Lender, such U.S. Borrower or the Company (on behalf of any Borrowing Subsidiary) also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Lender's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, the Borrowers shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $50,000,000, (ii) the sum of the total

          (c)  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.
Expiration Date.
          (d)  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or the U.S. Lenders, the Issuing Lender hereby grants to each U.S. Lender, and each U.S. Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such U.S. Lender's U.S. Commitment Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each U.S. Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the General Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, such U.S. Lender's U.S. Commitment Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Lender and not reimbursed on or before the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 4.01, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrowers for any reason. Each U.S. Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the U.S. Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Participations.
          (e)  If the Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the General Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if such Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by such Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that such U.S. Borrower or the Company (on behalf of the applicable Borrowing Subsidiary) may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with a U.S. Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, such Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting U.S. Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan. If such Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the General Administrative Agent shall notify each U.S. Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such U.S. Lender's U.S. Commitment Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each U.S. Lender shall pay to the General Administrative Agent its U.S. Commitment Percentage of
Reimbursement.
provided
 
the payment then due from such Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 6.01 with respect to U.S. Revolving Loans made by such U.S. Lender (and Section 6.01 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the U.S. Lenders), and the General Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from the U.S. Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the General Administrative Agent of any payment from such Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the General Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Lender or, to the extent that U.S. Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such U.S. Lenders and the Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a U.S. Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of U.S. Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
mutatis
mutandis
          (f)  Each applicable Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 4.01 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of:
Obligations Absolute.
     (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein;
     (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement;
     (iii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that any Borrower, any other party guaranteeing, or otherwise obligated with, any Borrower, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof or any other Person may at any time have against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender, the General Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement or any other related or unrelated agreement or transaction;
     (iv) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
     (v) payment by the Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
     (vi) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind of the Issuing Lender, the Lenders, the General Administrative Agent or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 4.01, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of such Borrower's obligations hereunder.
Neither the General Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Lender nor any of their Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or
 
failure to make any payment thereunder, including any of the circumstances specified in clauses (i) through (vi) above, as well as any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Lender from liability to such Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Lender's failure to exercise the agreed standard of care (as set forth below) in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that the Issuing Lender shall have exercised the agreed standard of care in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that the Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; that the Issuing Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

          (g) The Issuing Lender shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the General Administrative Agent and such Borrower for whose account such Letter of Credit was issued by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender and the U.S. Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any U.S. Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 4.01 to reimburse the Issuing Lender shall be for the account of such U.S. Lender to the extent of such payment.

          (b) To request a Swingline Loan, a U.S. Borrower or the Company (on behalf of any Borrowing Subsidiary) shall notify the General Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The General Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from such U.S. Borrower or the Company (on behalf of any Borrowing Subsidiary). The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to such Borrower by means of a
 
credit to the general deposit account of such Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 4.01, by remittance to the Issuing Lender) by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
          (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the General Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the U.S. Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which U.S. Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the General Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each U.S. Lender, specifying in such notice such U.S. Lender's U.S. Commitment Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each U.S. Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the General Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such U.S. Lender's U.S. Commitment Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each U.S. Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each U.S. Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 6.01 with respect to U.S. Revolving Loans made by such U.S. Lender (and Section 6.01 shall apply, to the payment obligations of the U.S. Lenders), and the General Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the U.S. Lenders. The General Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the General Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from a Borrower (or other party on behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the General Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the General Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the General Administrative Agent to the U.S. Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrowers of any default in the payment thereof.
mutatis
mutandis,
          SECTION 6.01. . (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable Currency to the account of the Applicable Administrative Agent or an Affiliate thereof, most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders, by 2:00 p.m., Local Time or, in the case of any Japanese Revolving Loan by 12:00 noon, Local Time. The Applicable Administrative Agent will make Loans available to the applicable
Funding of Borrowings
 
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Applicable Administrative Agent in (i) New York City with respect to Loans made in Dollars, (ii) London with respect to Loans made in a Committed Currency and (iii) Tokyo with respect to Loans made in Japanese Yen, as the case may be. If a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, the Applicable Administrative Agent shall return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.
          (b) Unless the Applicable Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 6.01 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to such Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Administrative Agent, then the Applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (A) in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Applicable Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of Borrowings denominated in any Alternate Currency, the interest rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Administrative Agent to reflect its cost of funds for the amount advanced by such Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender, or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate on the applicable Borrowing; that no repayment by such Borrower pursuant to this sentence shall be deemed to be a prepayment for purposes of Section 6.11. If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
provided
          SECTION 6.02. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower or the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower or the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Competitive Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections.
          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower or the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) shall notify the Applicable Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the applicable Borrower or the Company (on its own behalf or
 
on behalf of any other Borrower) were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election; that an Interest Election Request delivered not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the Restatement Date in respect of the conversion of an ABR Borrowing to a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be effective on the second Business Day after the Restatement Date. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Applicable Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Applicable Administrative Agent and signed by the Company or the Applicable Borrower.
provided
          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.03:
     (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower or the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Applicable Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
          (e) If the Company or the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be (i) converted to an ABR Borrowing if it is denominated in Dollars or (ii) continued as such with an Interest Period of one month if it is denominated in an Alternate Currency.
          SECTION 6.03. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
          (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of a Class; that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of a Class shall be
provided
 
in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $3,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments of such Class if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans of such Class, (i) the outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure of such Class would exceed the Commitment of such Class or (ii) the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures plus the Competitive Loan Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
          (c) The Company shall notify the General Administrative Agent, of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the General Administrative Agent or an affiliate thereof shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of any Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the General Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of any Commitments shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable Commitments of the applicable Class.
provided
          SECTION 6.04. (a) Each of the U.S. Borrowers and each Borrowing Subsidiary hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the General Administrative Agent for the account of each U.S. Lender (i) on the Maturity Date, the then unpaid principal amount of the U.S. Revolving Loans of such Lender and (ii) the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan made by such U.S. Lender to such Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan.

          (c) Each of the Borrowers hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the European Administrative Agent for the account of each Multicurrency Lender (i) on the Maturity Date, the then unpaid principal amount of its Multicurrency Revolving Loans and (ii) the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan made by such Multicurrency Lender to such Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan.
          (d) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
          (e) Each Administrative Agent shall maintain a Register pursuant to subsection 13.04(d) and an account for each applicable Lender in which it shall record (i) the
 
amount of each Loan made hereunder and any promissory note evidencing such Loan, the Class and Type thereof (and, in the case of an Alternate Currency Loan, the Currency) and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by such Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
          (f) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender maintained pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or any Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (g) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the General Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 13.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its assigns).
          SECTION 6.05. (a) The Company may, by written notice to the General Administrative Agent from time to time (which notice the General Administrative Agent shall promptly forward to the Lenders), request that the Commitment of any Class be increased by an amount not to exceed the Incremental Facility Amount at such time. Such notice shall set forth the amount of the requested increase (which shall be in minimum increments of $1,000,000 and a minimum amount of $10,000,000 or equal to the remaining Incremental Facility Amount), the Class or Classes of the requested increase and the date on which such increase is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than 10 Business Days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice and which, in any event, must be on or prior to the Maturity Date), and shall offer each Lender of the affected Class the opportunity to increase its Commitment by its Applicable Percentage of such Class of the proposed increased amount.

provided
 
Augmenting Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agents (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and the Borrowers and each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the General Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence its Commitment and/or its status as a Lender hereunder. Any increase in the Commitments of any Class may be made in an amount which is less than the increase requested by the Company if the Company is unable to arrange for, or chooses not to arrange for, Augmenting Lenders.
          (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agents may take any and all actions as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that, after giving effect to any increase in the Commitments of any Class pursuant to Section 6.05(a), the outstanding Revolving Loans (if any) of such Class are held by the Lenders in accordance with their new Applicable Percentages of such Class. This may be accomplished at the discretion of the General Administrative Agent (i) by requiring the outstanding Revolving Loans to be prepaid with the proceeds of a new Revolving Borrowing of such Class, (ii) by causing Non-Increasing Lenders to assign (at par, with accrued interest and fees) portions of their outstanding Revolving Loans of the affected Class to Increasing Lenders and Augmenting Lenders, or (iii) by any combination of the foregoing. Any prepayment or assignment described in this paragraph (b) shall be subject to Section 6.11, but otherwise without premium or penalty.

          (f) The Company and the other Borrowers will use reasonable efforts to implement and maintain internal controls to monitor the Borrowings and repayments, with the object of preventing any request for a Borrowing that would cause conditions specified in the first sentence of each of Sections 2.01(a), (b) and (c) not to be satisfied.

          (a) the General Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be made in good faith and shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for the relevant Currency for such Interest Period; or
          (b) the General Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or, in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan, the Lender that is required to make such Loan) that the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
the General Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of the applicable Borrower) and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the General Administrative Agent notifies the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of the applicable Borrower) and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing, such Borrowing, if denominated in Dollars, shall be made as an ABR Borrowing and, if denominated in any Alternate Currency, shall be made as a Borrowing bearing interest at an interest rate reasonably determined by the General Administrative Agent to compensate the applicable Lenders for such Borrowing in such Currency for the applicable period and (iii) any request by the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) or any other Borrower for a Eurocurrency Competitive Borrowing shall be ineffective; that (x) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by the Company for Eurocurrency Competitive Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are not affected thereby and (y) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowing, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.

     (ii) impose on any Lender, the London interbank market, the Tokyo interbank market or any other interbank market relevant to the funding of Loans in Alternate Currencies any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans or Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit by an amount deemed by such
 
Lender to be material or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs actually incurred or reduction actually suffered.
          (b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts shall have been determined, shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies such Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

The obligations of the Borrowers under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the present value of the excess, if any, of (i) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, refinanced or not borrowed (assumed to be the Eurocurrency Rate applicable thereto) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, refinancing or failure to borrow or refinance to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow or refinance the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid or not borrowed or refinanced for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts shall have been determined shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. The obligations of the Borrowers under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
                         SECTION 6.12.

If the relevant Borrower shall be required to deduct any Non-Excluded Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or any Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount (an "") necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to Additional Amounts payable under this Section 6.12) such Lender or such Administrative Agent (as the case may be) shall receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the relevant Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the relevant Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability prepared by a Lender, or an Administrative Agent on its behalf and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount shall have been determined, absent manifest error, shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Such indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand therefor, which written demand shall be made within 60 days of the date such Lender or Administrative Agent receives written demand for payment of such Non-Excluded Taxes from the relevant Governmental Authority.
          (d) If a Lender (or participant) or an Administrative Agent receives a refund, which in its reasonable judgment is in respect of any Non-Excluded Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the relevant Borrower or with respect to which the relevant Borrower has paid Additional Amounts pursuant to this Section 6.12, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to the relevant Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or Additional Amounts paid, by the relevant Borrower under this Section 6.12 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender (or participant) or such Administrative Agent and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , , that the relevant Borrower, upon the request of such Lender (or participant) or such Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the relevant Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender (or participant) or such Administrative Agent in the event such Lender (or participant) or such Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

Such forms shall be delivered by each Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a participant, on or before the date such participant becomes a participant hereunder) and on or before the date, if any, such Lender changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office (a ""), unless each of the applicable lending office prior to such designation and the New Lending Office are located within the United States.

          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or in respect of its interest in any Letters of Credit resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and accrued interest thereon or its interest in Letters of Credit than the proportion received by any other Lender participating in such Loan or Letters of Credit, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit of such other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by such Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
          (d) Unless the Applicable Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Applicable Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Applicable Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Applicable Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lenders with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Administrative Agent, (i) if the relevant amount is denominated in Dollars, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Applicable Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) if the relevant amount is denominated in any other Currency, at the interest rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Administrative Agent to reflect the cost of funds for the amount paid by such Administrative Agent on behalf of such Borrower.
 
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 6.01(b) or 6.12(d), then the Applicable Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by such Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
     SECTION 6.14. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 6.10, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Additional Amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 6.12, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to file any certificate or document requested by the applicable Borrower (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions), to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such filing, designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 6.10 or 6.12, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
     (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 6.10, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 6.12, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then such Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and the applicable Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 13.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it and any and all rights and interests related thereto) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) such Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agents which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 6.10 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 6.12, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.
provided
     SECTION 6.15. In order to ensure that the Revolving Loans of each Class to be outstanding on and after the Restatement Date are held by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages of such Class after giving effect to the increase in the Commitments to be effected on the Restatement Date, the Borrowers shall repay and refinance all outstanding Revolving Loans, together with accrued interest thereon to but excluding the Restatement Date, under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Restatement Date with the proceeds of new Revolving Loans under this Agreement.

Exhibit 10.2
To: Zimmer Holdings, Inc.
Gentlemen/Mesdames:
     You have advised me that you have granted me a nonqualified stock option to purchase shares of the common stock of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. according to the terms set forth herein. I understand that it is expected that I will retain the stock I receive upon the exercise of this option consistent with the Company's share retention guidelines in effect at the time of exercise.
     My signature below indicates my agreement to the foregoing and my acceptance of all the terms of the option granted.
     Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") hereby grants, pursuant to the terms of the Zimmer Holdings, Inc. Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Plan"), to the heretofore named non-employee director of the Company (the "Optionee"), as a matter of separate inducement and agreement in connection with the Optionee's services as a non-employee director of the Company, and not as or in lieu of any fees, retainers, or other compensation for services, and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the option to purchase on or before the expiration of ten years from the date hereof (the "Expiration Date") the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares heretofore set forth of the common stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), at the aforementioned exercise price per share.
     This nonqualified stock option ("Option") is granted upon and subject to the following terms and conditions:
     1. Provided that the Optionee has at all times during the period beginning with the date of grant of the Option and ending on the date of exercise been a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and after the Option vests as described below (except as specifically set forth herein to the contrary), this Option may from time to time on or prior to the Expiration Date be exercised in the manner and subject to the terms hereinafter set forth.
     2. The Option hereby granted may be exercised, in whole or in part, by written notification delivered in person or by mail to the Secretary of the Company at its executive office in Warsaw, Indiana, or to the Company's designated agent, such notification to be effective upon receipt by the Secretary or the Company's designated agent, on or before the specified Expiration Date, in substantially the form enclosed hereto, specifying the number of shares with respect to which the Option is then being exercised and accompanied by payment for such shares. In the event the specified Expiration Date falls on a day
 
which is not a regular business day at the Company's executive office in Warsaw, Indiana then such written notification must be received at such office, or the office of the Company's designated agent, on or before the last regular business day prior to such Expiration Date. Payment is to be made by certified check or bank draft payable to the order of Zimmer Holdings, Inc., by payment through a broker in accordance with procedures permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, or by delivery of a certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee for at least six months having a fair market value at the date of exercise equal to the option price for such shares, or in any combination of the foregoing: provided, however, that payment in shares of Common Stock will not be permitted unless at least 100 shares of Common Stock are required and delivered for such purpose. Any stock certificate or certificates so delivered must be endorsed, or accompanied by a signature guaranteed stock power, to the order of Zimmer Holdings, Inc., with the signature guaranteed by a bank or trust company or by a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange. No shares shall be sold or delivered hereunder until full payment for such shares has been made. The Optionee shall have the rights of a shareholder only with respect to shares of stock for which certificates have been issued to her/him.
     3. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate or certificates for shares of its Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of any part of this Option prior to (i) the admission of such shares to listing on any stock exchange on which the stock may then be listed, (ii) the completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares under any state or federal law or rulings or regulations of any governmental regulatory body, (iii) the obtaining of any consent or approval or other clearance from any governmental agency, which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable, and (iv) the payment to the Company, upon its demand, of any amount requested by the Company for the purpose of satisfying its withholding obligation, if any, with respect to federal, state or local income or FICA earnings tax, other governmental impost, levy or any other applicable tax or assessment (plus interest or penalties thereon, if any, caused by a delay in making such payment) incurred by reason of the exercise of this Option or the transfer of shares thereupon.
     4. Except as provided below, this Option is not transferable by the Optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during the life of the Optionee, only by her/him. This Option is transferable by the Optionee, in whole or in part, to members of the Optionee's immediate family, to trusts solely for the benefit of such immediate family members and to partnerships in which such family members and/or trusts are the only partners. For this purpose, immediate family members means the Optionee's spouse, parents, children, stepchildren, grandchildren and legal dependants. Any transfer of the Options made under this provision will not be effective until notice of such transfer is delivered to the Company. If the Option is transferred, it shall be exercisable solely by the transferee and shall remain subject to the provisions of the Plan, including that it will be exercisable only to the extent that the Optionee or the Optionee's estate would have been entitled to exercise it if the Optionee had not transferred the Option. In the event of the death of the transferee prior to the expiration of the right to exercise the Option, the period during which the Option shall be exercisable by the executors, administrators, legatees and distributees of the transferee's estate, as the case may be, will terminate on the date one year following the date of the transferee's death. In no event will the Option be exercisable after the Expiration Date. The transferred Option shall be subject to such other rules as the Board shall determine.
     5. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof:
     (a) if the Optionee shall cease to be a non-employee director for reasons other than retirement or death while holding any portion of the vested Option that has not expired and has not been fully exercised, the Optionee, at any time within one year after the date she/he ceases to be a non-employee director (but in no event after the Expiration Date), may exercise the vested Option with respect to any shares of Common Stock as to which the Optionee has not exercised the Option on the date the Optionee ceased to be a non-employee director only to the extent that the Option is exercisable at the time of termination;
     (b) if the Optionee shall cease to be a non-employer director by reason of retirement or death while holding any portion of the Option that has not expired and has not been fully exercised, the Optionee, or in the case of death, the executors, administrators or distributees, as the case may be, at any time prior to the Expiration Date, may exercise the Option with respect to any shares of Common Stock as to which the Optionee has not exercised the Option on the date the Optionee ceased to be a non-employee director, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 5(d) below; or
     (c) if the Optionee ceases to be a non-employee director for reasons other than death and then dies holding any portion of the Option that has not been fully exercised, the Optionee's executors, administrators, heirs or distributees, as the case may be, may, at any time within the greater of (1) one year after the date of death or (2) the remainder of the period in which the Optionee could have exercised the Option had the Optionee not died, (but in no event under either (1) or (2) after the Expiration Date), exercise the Option with respect to any shares as to which the Optionee could have exercised the Option at the time of death.
 
     (d) Subject to subparagraph (a) above, this Option with respect to all 100% of the total number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Option shall become exercisable on December 31 next succeeding the date hereof. In the event the non-employee director ceases to be a non-employee director by reason of retirement or death, the total number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Option shall become exercisable.
     Retirement means the termination of the Optionee's membership on the Board on or after the Optionee's 65th birthday, or on or after the Optionee's 55th birthday after having served as a member of the Board for 10 or more years. In the event the Option is exercised by the executors, administrators, legatees or distributees of the estate of the Optionee, the Company shall be under no obligation to issue stock hereunder unless and until the Company is satisfied that the person or persons exercising the Option are the fully appointed legal representatives of the Optionee's estate or the proper legatees or distributees thereof.
     6. Under certain circumstances, if the Optionee's membership on the Board terminates during the three year period following a change in control of the Company, this Option may become fully vested and exercisable. Please refer to the Plan for more information.
     7. If prior to the Expiration Date changes occur in the outstanding Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, recapitalization, mergers, consolidations, stock splits, combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, the number, class and the exercise price of shares subject to the Option shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board, whose determination shall be conclusive. If as a result of any adjustment under this paragraph any Optionee should become entitled to a fractional share of stock, the Optionee shall have the right to purchase only the adjusted number of full shares and no payment or other adjustment will be made with respect to the fractional share so disregarded.
     8. Until the Optionee is advised otherwise by the Company, all notices and other correspondence with respect to the Option will be effective upon receipt at the following address:
Board of Directors Zimmer Holdings, Inc. 345 East Main Street Post Office Box 708 Warsaw, Indiana 46581-0708
     9. Except as explicitly provided in this agreement, this agreement will not confer any rights upon the Optionee, including any right with respect to continued membership on the Board or any right to future awards under the Plan. In no event shall the value, at any time, of this agreement, the Common Stock covered by this agreement or any other benefit provided under this agreement be included as compensation or earnings for purposes of any other compensation, retirement, or benefit plan offered to Board members unless otherwise specifically provided for in such plan.
     10. The Board shall have full authority and discretion, subject only to the express terms of the Plan, to decide all matters relating to the administration and interpretation of the Plan and this agreement and all such Board determinations shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the Optionee and all interested parties. The terms and conditions set forth in this agreement are subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Plan, as amended from time to time, which shall be controlling. This agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties and may not be modified or amended except in writing duly signed by the parties. The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any provision of this agreement or the Plan by the Company will not constitute a waiver by the Company of the same provision or right at any other time or a waiver of any other provision or right. The various provisions of this agreement are severable and any determination of invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall have no effect on the remaining provisions. This agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors, assigns, and heirs of the respective parties. The validity and construction of this agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Indiana.
