ITEM 4.01 CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT
(a) Previous Independent Accountant
     On April 22, 2005, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the "Committee") dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Zimmer Puerto Rico Savings and Investment Program (the "Program") and retained Crowe Chizek and Company LLC as such independent registered public accounting firm. The decision to dismiss PwC was made by the Committee.
     The reports of PwC on the financial statements of the Program for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle.
     During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and through April 22, 2005, there have been no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years.
     During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and through April 22, 2005, there have been no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a)(1)(v)).
     PwC has furnished the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of such letter dated May 20, 2005 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
(b) New Independent Accountant
     The Committee engaged Crowe Chizek and Company LLC as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Program on April 22, 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and through April 22, 2005, the Company has not consulted with Crowe Chizek and Company LLC regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Program's financial statements; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to that Item) or a reportable event (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
