(the "Company"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Zimmer Holdings, Inc., entered into a Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Employment Agreement (individually, the "Non-Compete Agreement" or collectively, the "Non-Compete Agreements") with certain U.S.-based executive officers, including each of J. Raymond Elliott, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company; Sam R. Leno, Executive Vice President, Finance and Corporate Services and Chief Financial Officer of the Company; David C. Dvorak, Group President, Global Businesses and Chief Legal Officer of the Company; Sheryl L.

Blanchard, Senior Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer of the Company; Jon E. Kramer, President, U.S. Sales of the Company; and Chad F. Phipps, Associate General Counsel and Secretary of the Company (collectively, the "executive officers").
     The Non-Compete Agreements entered into with the executive officers are in substantially the same form. Each Non-Compete Agreement provides that the executive officer may not disclose, transfer or use (or seek to induce others to disclose, transfer or use) any confidential information of the Company. In addition, during the executive officer's employment with the Company, the executive officer may not engage, directly or indirectly, in any activity, employment or business venture that is competitive with the Company's business, deprives the Company of any business opportunity or conflicts with the Company's business interests.
     Each Non-Compete Agreement also provides that, following termination of employment with the Company, the executive officer is restricted from competing with the Company, soliciting customers or potential customers of the Company and employing or soliciting for employment individuals employed by the Company for a period of eighteen months within a specified territory, which generally includes every country in which the Company has significant operations. To the extent the executive officer is unable to obtain employment consistent with his or her training and education solely because of the provisions of the Non-Compete Agreement, the executive officer will be eligible to receive, subject to the terms of the Non-Compete Agreement, (i) payments equal to the executive officer's monthly base pay at the time of the executive officer's termination for each month of such unemployment through the end of the non-competition period, or (ii) to the extent the executive officer is able to obtain employment, but solely because of the Non-Compete Agreement, the monthly base pay for the replacement employment is less than the executive officer's monthly base pay at the time of his or her termination, payments equal to the difference in monthly base pay for each such month through the end of the non-competition period.
     The foregoing description of the Non-Compete Agreements is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Form of Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Employment Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Employee acknowledges also that this Agreement would by itself constitute sufficient and final Court evidence of the requirements necessary in order to obtain any of the above judicial measures, except for summary evidence concerning the carrying out of competing activity by Employee, and in addition to any other legal remedies which may be available. In addition to all other relief to which it shall be entitled, Company shall be entitled to cease all payments to which Employee would otherwise be entitled under Section 7 (C) hereto; continue to enforce this Agreement; recover from Employee all payments made under Section 7 (C), and recover from Employee all litigation costs and attorneys' fees incurred by Company in any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement in which Company prevails, including, but not limited to, any action or proceeding in which Company seeks enforcement of this Agreement or seeks relief from Employee's violation of this Agreement.
