Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     On May 7, 2008, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") implemented a corporate reorganization which eliminated the position of Group President, Americas and Global Marketing and Chief Marketing Officer previously held by Sheryl L. Conley, one of the Company's named executive officers. The reorganization will facilitate the separation of the Company's commercial sales and marketing activities from the corporate functions of medical education and research and development, as part of ongoing efforts to enhance the Company's compliance model. Ms. Conley's employment with the Company will end on May 16, 2008. Ms. Conley does not have an employment agreement, but she will be entitled to receive severance under the Company's severance plan that applies to all of its salaried U.S. employees. The Company has agreed to reimburse her for the costs of outplacement assistance not to exceed $15,000. In addition, the Company expects to enter into a consulting agreement with Ms. Conley for her assistance with ongoing and transition-related matters at an hourly rate based on her current annual salary.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On May 5, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the amendment and restatement of the Company's By-Laws effective as of May 6, 2008 (the "Restated By-Laws"). The amendments to Article VIII eliminate the super-majority vote required to amend certain provisions of the Restated By-Laws. The amendments to Article II, Sections 2.07 and 2.08 clarify that the advance notice provisions apply to all stockholder proposals and nominations. The amendments to Sections 2.07 and 2.08 also require any stockholder who provides advance notice of a stockholder proposal or nomination to provide additional information to the Company as part of such notice, including information as to whether the stockholder has entered into any hedging or other transaction that has the effect or intent of managing its economic risk or increasing its voting power with respect to the Company's common stock.
     This summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Restated By-Laws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a Director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected); and (B) as to the stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined in Section 2.07(c)(ii) below, (1) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's stock ledger, and current name and address, if different, of such Stockholder Associated Person, (2) the class, series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned by such stockholder and by such Stockholder Associated Person, if any, (3) the nominee holder for, and the number of, shares owned beneficially but not of record by such stockholder and by any such Stockholder Associated Person, (4) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk of stock price changes for, or to increase the voting power of, such stockholder or any such Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any shares of stock of the Corporation, (5) a representation that the
provided, however
 
stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such nomination, and (6) a representation whether the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such nomination.

     (b) . Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting under Section 2.04.

Special Meetings of Stockholders
     (c) . (i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.07 shall be eligible to serve as Directors.

Section
Procedure for Election of Directors; Required Vote.
     (a) . Election of Directors at all meetings of the stockholders at which Directors are to be elected shall be by ballot. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors under an applicable Preferred Stock Designation, and except as provided in this Section 2.09(a), each Director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election at any meeting for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected, the Directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. For purposes of this Section 2.09(a), a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a Director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that Director's election. If a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is an incumbent Director, the Director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors, subject to acceptance by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision may each consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. The Director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent Director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such Director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a Director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 2.09(a), or if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent Director, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.03 of the Certificate of Incorporation or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.01 of the Certificate of Incorporation.
Election of Directors
     (b) . Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, a Preferred Stock Designation, applicable stock exchange rules or other rules and regulations applicable to the Corporation or these By-Laws, in all matters other than the election of Directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter shall be the act of the stockholders.
Other Matters

(a) The Board of Directors by resolution shall appoint, or shall authorize an officer of the Corporation to appoint, one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives, to act at the meetings of stockholders and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated as alternate inspector(s) to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed to act or is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging such person's duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict

The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding officer, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the presiding officer of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding officer at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding officer should so determine, such person shall so declare to the meeting that any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
      3.01.    The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these By-Laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

      3.04.    Notice of any special meeting of Directors shall be given to each Director at such person's business or residence in writing by hand delivery, first-class or overnight mail or courier service, telegram or facsimile transmission, orally by telephone or any other lawful means. If mailed by first-class mail, such notice shall be deemed adequately delivered when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid, at least 5 calendar days before such meeting. If by telegram, overnight mail or courier service, such notice shall be deemed adequately delivered when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company or the notice is delivered to the overnight mail or courier service company at least 24 hours before such meeting. If by facsimile transmission, such notice shall be deemed adequately delivered when the notice is transmitted at least 12 hours before such meeting. If by telephone, by hand delivery or by other lawful means, the notice shall be given at least 12 hours prior to the time set for the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice of such meeting, except for

A meeting may be held at any time without notice if all the Directors are present (except when Directors attend for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, because it is not lawfully called or conveyed) or if those not present waive notice of the meeting either before or after such meeting.
      3.05.    Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in accordance with applicable law.

Members of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
Section
Conference Telephone Meetings.
      3.07.    Subject to Article VII of the Certificate of Incorporation, a whole number of Directors equal to at least a majority of the Whole Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but if at any meeting of the Board of Directors there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Any such committee may, to the extent permitted by law, exercise such powers and shall have such responsibilities as shall be specified in the designating resolution. In the absence or disqualification of any member of such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not constituting a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
