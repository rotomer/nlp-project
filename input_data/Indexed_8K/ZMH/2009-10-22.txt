Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
     On October 22, 2009, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the "Registrant") reported its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The Registrant's earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and the information set forth therein is incorporated herein by reference and constitutes a part of this report.
     The earnings release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes two types of non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The first type of non-GAAP financial measure included in the press release consists of sales information reported on a constant currency basis which has been calculated by translating actual current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases that exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
     The second type of non-GAAP financial measure included in the press release consists of operating performance measures that have been adjusted to exclude certain items. Adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2009 excludes the effects of inventory step-up, acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses and a provision for known and anticipated claims relating to the 2008 temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the Acetabular Component in the U.S. Adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude the effects of those items, net of tax. Adjusted net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and projected adjusted diluted EPS for the full year 2009 exclude the effects of those items and a net curtailment and settlement gain recognized during the second quarter of 2009, net of tax. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS for the 2008 periods presented in the press release exclude the effects of those items, other than the net curtailment and settlement gain recognized in 2009, as well as a tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2008 related to a civil settlement amount paid in 2007.
Durom
     Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate the performance of the business and believes that it provides useful information to investors by offering the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Registrant's on-going operating results, the ability to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and to perform related trend analysis, and a higher degree of transparency of certain items. Management considers the provision related to the Acetabular Component a non-recurring item that, as explained in the press release, is qualitatively different from the Registrant's routine product liability claims.
Durom
     All of the non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release.
     The Registrant is furnishing the information contained in this report, including the Exhibit, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange

Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC. By filing this report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, the Registrant makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in this report, including the Exhibit.

(WARSAW, IN) October 22, 2009Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SWX: ZMH) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The Company reported third quarter net sales of $976 million, an increase of 2.4% reported and 3.6% constant currency over the third quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.70 reported and $0.88 adjusted, a decrease of 9.3% adjusted from the prior year period. Third quarter 2008 adjusted earnings per share included a gain of $0.08 on the sale of certain equity holdings.
"We are pleased that our sales momentum continued to build in the third quarter as we achieved year-over-year constant currency growth in revenues in each of our three geographic segments," said David Dvorak, Zimmer President and CEO. "Further, we believe we are stabilizing our core knee and hip franchises and establishing a solid foundation for future growth."
Operating profit on an adjusted basis for the third quarter of $264 million was flat compared to the prior year's third quarter. Net earnings for the third quarter were $149.9
 
million on a reported basis and $188.3 million on an adjusted basis, a decrease of 13.9% adjusted from the prior year period. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $352.3 million. Net earnings for the first nine months of 2009 were $562.2 million on a reported basis and $613.8 million on an adjusted basis, a decrease of 12.3% adjusted from the prior year period.
During the quarter, the Company utilized $67 million of cash to acquire 1.5 million shares under its $1.25 billion repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, $730 million of share repurchase authorization remained available. The Board of Directors has recently extended this program until December 31, 2010.
The Company also recorded a provision of $35.0 million in the quarter, or approximately $0.10 per share net of tax, for known and anticipated claims relating to the 2008 temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the  Acetabular Component in the U.S. Adjusted figures in this release exclude the impact of this provision.

Guidance
The Company reaffirmed its sales and earnings guidance. Full year revenues for 2009 are expected to increase between 1% and 3% on a constant currency basis. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with current levels, the Company estimates that foreign currency translation will reduce revenue for 2009 by approximately 1.6%. Full year 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $3.85 to $4.00.

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As used in this press release, the term "" refers to operating performance measures that exclude inventory step-up, the provision for certain Acetabular Component product claims in the U.S., acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses, net curtailment and settlement, and the tax benefit related to the 2007 civil settlement. The provision related to the Acetabular Component is classified as a non-recurring item that is different from the Company's routine product liability claims for a number of reasons, including that the provision is limited to revisions associated with surgeries that predate the Company's voluntary suspension and which also occur within two years of the original surgery date. The term "" refers to any financial measure that excludes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in this press release.
