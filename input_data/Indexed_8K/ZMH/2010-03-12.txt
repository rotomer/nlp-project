Exhibit 99.1
Zimmer's Porous Femoral component was the subject of a study of 108 patients ("The High Failure Rate of a High-Flex Total Knee Arthroplasty Design") by Drs. Berger and Della Valle of Rush University Medical Center. According to the published abstract, Drs. Berger and Della Valle revised 9 (8.3%) patients for femoral loosening and pain. The study also reported that 39 (36%) patients showed evidence of radiographic loosening and that "[l]oosening and revision were not related to surgeon, approach or patient type."

The Porous component has a strong track record of clinical success. According to the 2009 Australian National Joint Replacement Registry report, Zimmer's cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) components recorded the lowest revision rate (reported as revisions per 100 observed component years) of all major cementless TKA systems utilized in the market (0.5 revisions per 100 observed component years). Of the 7,100 implantations using the Porous or Porous systems since 2004, revisions were reported for 120 patients, representing a revision rate of 1.7%, inclusive of all components and reasons for revision.

The performance of the Porous Femoral component in the Australian National Joint Registry and in Zimmer's post-market surveillance activities demonstrates that it is a safe and effective product when used as indicated in the surgical technique. More than 150,000 and Porous Femoral components have been sold since 2003. Sales of the Porous component represented approximately 2% of the company's knee revenues in 2009.
