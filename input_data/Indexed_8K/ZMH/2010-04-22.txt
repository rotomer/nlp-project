Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
     On April 22, 2010, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the "Registrant") reported its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. The Registrant's earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and the information set forth therein is incorporated herein by reference and constitutes a part of this report.
     The earnings release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes two types of non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The first type of non-GAAP financial measure included in the press release consists of sales information reported on a constant currency basis which has been calculated by translating actual current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases that exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
     The second type of non-GAAP financial measure included in the press release consists of operating performance measures that have been adjusted to exclude certain items. The earnings release presents adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS and projected adjusted diluted EPS to exclude the effects of inventory step-up and acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses, net of tax. The earnings release also presents adjusted operating profit to exclude the effects of inventory step-up and acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses.
     Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate the performance of the business and believes that it provides useful information to investors by offering the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Registrant's on-going operating results, the ability to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and to perform related trend analysis, and a higher degree of transparency of certain items.
     All of the non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release.
     The Registrant is furnishing the information contained in this report, including the Exhibit, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC. By filing this report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, the Registrant makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in this report, including the Exhibit.
 
Item 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
     (d) Exhibits
 
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(WARSAW, IN) April 22, 2010Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SIX: ZMH) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. The Company reported first quarter net sales of $1.06 billion, an increase of 7.1% reported and 3.4% constant currency over the first quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.01 reported and $1.02 adjusted, an increase of 7.4% adjusted over the prior year period.
"We are executing strategies that will enable us to accelerate growth in our served markets," said David Dvorak, Zimmer President and CEO. "Our first quarter results demonstrated improvement in both top-line and earnings per share growth rates compared to last year and to the fourth quarter of 2009. We again generated year-over-year sales increases in all three of our geographic segments, and our performance in the Asia Pacific region was particularly strong with 11% constant currency growth."
 
Net earnings for the first quarter were $205.4 million on a reported basis and $207.4 million on an adjusted basis, a decrease of 1.2% adjusted from the prior year period. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $259.5 million.
In the first quarter, the Company acquired 1.5 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $93.5 million. At the end of the quarter, $117.6 million of authorization remained under the Company's $1.25 billion repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2010.
Guidance
The Company reaffirmed its full-year sales and adjusted EPS guidance for 2010. Full-year revenues are expected to increase between 3% and 5% on a constant currency basis. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the Company estimates that foreign currency translation will increase revenues by approximately 0.5% for the full year 2010, resulting in expected revenue growth on a reported basis between 3.5% and 5.5%. Full-year 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.35.
