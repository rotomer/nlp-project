     On July 22, 2010, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the "Registrant") reported its results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2010. The Registrant's earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and the information set forth therein is incorporated herein by reference and constitutes a part of this report.
     The earnings release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes two types of non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The first type of non-GAAP financial measure included in the press release consists of sales information reported on a constant currency basis which has been calculated by translating actual current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases that exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
     Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and projected adjusted diluted EPS for the full year 2010 exclude the effects of inventory step-up, acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses and a provision for known and anticipated claims relating to the 2008 temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the Acetabular Component in the U.S., net of tax. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS for the 2009 periods presented in the press release exclude the effects of inventory step-up, acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses and a net curtailment and settlement gain recognized during the second quarter of 2009, net of tax.
Durom
     All of the non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release.
     The Registrant is furnishing the information contained in this report, including the Exhibit, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC. By filing this report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, the Registrant makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in this report, including the Exhibit.
     (d) Exhibits
 
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
(WARSAW, IN) July 22, 2010Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SIX: ZMH) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2010. The Company reported second quarter net sales of $1.06 billion, an increase of 3.7% reported and 3.3% constant currency over the second quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.82 reported and $1.09 adjusted, an increase of 9.0% adjusted over the prior year period.
"Our second quarter performance was characterized by year-over-year constant currency sales growth in all geographic segments, strong earnings and cash flow, and the continued introduction of important new products and instruments," said David Dvorak, Zimmer President and CEO. "We anticipate accelerated growth through 2010 as these new offerings augment our portfolio of clinically-proven solutions."
 
Net earnings for the second quarter were $165.5 million on a reported basis and $221.2 million on an adjusted basis, an increase of 2.6% adjusted over the prior year period. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $272.7 million, an increase of 39.8% over the second quarter of 2009. Net earnings for the first six months of 2010 were $370.9 million on a reported basis and $428.6 million on an adjusted basis, an increase of 0.7% adjusted over the prior year period.
In the second quarter, the Company recorded an additional $75 million provision for known and anticipated worldwide claims related to the previously announced voluntary suspension of marketing and distribution of the Acetabular Component in the U.S. Adjusted 2010 figures in this release exclude the impact of this provision.
Durom
During the quarter, the Company utilized $85.4 million of cash to acquire 1.4 million shares under its existing $1.25 billion repurchase program. At the end of the second quarter, $32.2 million of share repurchase authorization remained available under this program, which expires on December 31, 2010.
The Company's Board of Directors has approved an additional $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2013. Purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, depending on market conditions and other factors.
The Company also announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Beijing Montagne Medical Device Co., Ltd., a leader in the rapidly growing Chinese orthopaedic implant market. Financial terms were not disclosed. Subject to regulatory approvals and certain other conditions, the acquisition is expected to close in late 2010 or early 2011.
 
Guidance
The Company reaffirmed its full-year sales and adjusted EPS guidance for 2010. Full-year revenues are expected to increase between 3% and 5% on a constant currency basis. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the Company estimates that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 0.5% for the full year 2010, resulting in expected revenue growth on a reported basis between 2.5% and 4.5%. Full-year 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.35.
