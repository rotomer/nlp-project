     On October 28, 2010, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the "Registrant") reported its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. The Registrant's earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and the information set forth therein is incorporated herein by reference and constitutes a part of this report.
     The earnings release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes two types of non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The first type of non-GAAP financial measure included in the press release consists of sales information reported on a constant currency basis which has been calculated by translating actual current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases that exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
     The second type of non-GAAP financial measure included in the press release consists of operating performance measures that have been adjusted to exclude certain items. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and projected adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2010 exclude the effects of acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses, net of tax. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, projected adjusted diluted EPS for the full year 2010 and adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2009 exclude the effects of inventory step-up, acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses and a provision for known and anticipated Acetabular Component product claims, net of tax. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 exclude the effects of these items as well as a net curtailment and settlement gain recognized during the second quarter of 2009, net of tax.
Durom
     All of the non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release.
     The Registrant is furnishing the information contained in this report, including the Exhibit, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC. By filing this report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, the Registrant makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in this report, including the Exhibit.
 
     (d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
(WARSAW, IN) October 28, 2010Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SIX: ZMH) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. The Company reported third quarter net sales of $965 million, a decrease of 1.1% reported and 0.5% constant currency from the third quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.96 on both a reported and an adjusted basis, an increase of 9.1% adjusted over the prior year period.
"The Company delivered solid earnings and cash flow performance in a quarter affected by challenging global economic conditions," said David Dvorak, Zimmer President and CEO. "We believe that our continued progress with new product introductions across our businesses will position us for an improved performance in the fourth quarter and accelerated growth beyond 2010 as the economy strengthens."
Net earnings for the third quarter were $191.1 million on a reported basis and $192.4 million on an adjusted basis, an increase of 2.2% adjusted over the prior year period.
 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $320.3 million. Net earnings for the first nine months of 2010 were $562.0 million on a reported basis and $621.0 million on an adjusted basis, an increase of 1.2% adjusted over the prior year period.
During the quarter, the Company utilized $225.6 million of cash to acquire 4.2 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, $1.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remained available under the current program, which expires on December 31, 2013.
Guidance
The Company provided fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EPS guidance and updated its full-year sales and adjusted EPS guidance for 2010. Fourth quarter revenues are expected to grow in the range of 0% to 2% on a constant currency basis. As a result, the Company now expects 2010 full-year revenues to increase approximately 2% on a constant currency basis, which compares with prior guidance of between 3% and 5%. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the Company estimates that foreign currency translation will increase revenues for the full year 2010 by 0.5%. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.22. As a result, full-year 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share are now projected to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.29, which is within the prior guidance of $4.15 to $4.35.
