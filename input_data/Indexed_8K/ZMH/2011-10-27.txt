On October 27, 2011, Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the "Registrant") reported its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. The Registrant's earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and the information set forth therein is incorporated herein by reference and constitutes a part of this report.
The earnings release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes two types of non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The first type of non-GAAP financial measure included in the press release consists of sales information reported on a constant currency basis which has been calculated by translating actual current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases that exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The second type of non-GAAP financial measure included in the press release consists of operating performance measures that have been adjusted to exclude certain items.
Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 exclude the effects of inventory step-up, special items and certain tax adjustments. Included in special items are acquisition and integration costs as well as employee termination benefits, certain contract terminations and asset impairment charges connected with global restructuring and transformation initiatives. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 and projected adjusted diluted EPS for the full year 2011 exclude the effects of these items and the provision for certain Acetabular Component product claims, net of tax.
Durom
Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate the performance of the business and believes that it provides useful information to investors by offering the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Registrant's on-going operating results, the ability to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and to perform related trend analysis, and a higher degree of transparency of certain items. In addition, adjusted diluted EPS is used as a performance metric in the Registrant's incentive compensation programs.
All of the non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release.
The Registrant is furnishing the information contained in this report, including the Exhibit, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC. By filing this report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, the Registrant makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in this report, including the Exhibit.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(WARSAW, IN) October 27, 2011Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SIX: ZMH) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. The Company reported third quarter net sales of $1,031 million, an increase of 6.9% reported and 2.4% constant currency over the third quarter of 2010. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.01 reported and $1.04 adjusted, an increase of 8.3% adjusted over the prior year period.
"Zimmer delivered against our financial commitments in the third quarter with consistent results in both revenues and earnings," said David Dvorak, Zimmer President and CEO. "Progress in the commercialization of new products supported a strong performance in many international markets. Through this progress and ongoing financial discipline, we continue to deliver value to stockholders."
 
Net earnings for the third quarter were $191.5 million on a reported basis and $197.2 million on an adjusted basis, an increase of 2.4% adjusted over the prior year period. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $350.6 million.
During the quarter, the Company utilized $549 million of cash, supported by $375 million of borrowings, to acquire 10.1 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, $299 million of share repurchase authorization remained available under the current program, which expires on December 31, 2013.
Guidance
The Company updated its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2011. Full-year revenues for 2011 are now expected to increase between 2.3% and 2.7% on a constant currency basis from 2010. The Company estimates that foreign currency translation will increase revenues by approximately 2.5% for the full year 2011, resulting in reported revenue growth between 4.8% and 5.2%. This compares with prior revenue guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% constant currency and 5.5% to 6.5% reported growth over prior year. Full-year 2011 diluted earnings per share are now projected to be in a range of $4.40 to $4.45 on a reported basis and $4.75 to $4.80 on an adjusted basis, which represents a narrowing toward the top end of prior adjusted earnings guidance.
